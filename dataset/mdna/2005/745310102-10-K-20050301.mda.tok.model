table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as puget energy s and puget sound energy s pse objectives  expectations and intentions 
words or phrases such as anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  plans  predicts  projects  will likely result  will continue and similar expressions are intended to identify certain of these forward looking statements 
however  these words are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements 
in addition  any statements that refer to expectations  projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
puget energy s and pse s actual results could differ materially from results that may be anticipated by such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the section entitled forward looking statements included elsewhere in this report 
except as required by law  neither puget energy nor pse undertakes an obligation to revise any forward looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may subsequently arise 
readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in this report and in puget energy s and pse s other reports filed with the united states securities and exchange commission that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect puget energy s and pse s business  prospects and results of operations 
overview puget energy is an energy services holding company  and all its operations are conducted through its two subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries are pse  a regulated electric and gas utility company  and infrastrux  a utility construction and services company 
on february   following a strategic review of infrastrux  puget energy s board of directors decided to exit the utility construction services sector 
puget energy intends to monetize its interest in infrastrux through sale or recapitalization and to invest the proceeds of such monetization in its regulated utility subsidiary  pse 
puget sound energy pse generates revenues from the sale of electric and gas services  mainly to residential and commercial customers within washington state 
a majority of pse s revenues are generated in the first and fourth quarters during the winter heating season in washington state 
as a regulated utility company  pse is subject to federal energy regulatory commission ferc and washington commission regulation which may impact a large array of business activities  including limitation of future rate increases  directed accounting requirements that may negatively impact earnings  licensing of pse owned generation facilities  and other ferc and washington commission directives that may impact pse s long term goals 
in addition  pse is subject to risks inherent to the utility industry as a whole  including weather changes affecting purchases and sales of energy  outages at owned and non owned generation plants where energy is obtained  storms or other events which can damage electric distribution and transmission lines  and energy trading and wholesale market stability over time 
pse s main operational goal has been to provide reliable  safe and cost effective energy to its customers 
to help accomplish this goal  pse is attempting to be more self sufficient in energy generation resources 
owning more generation resources rather than purchasing power through contracts and on the wholesale market is intended to allow customers rates to remain stable 
pse is continually exploring new electric power resource generation and long term purchase power agreements to meet this goal 
during  pse made progress in reaching this goal 
table of contents purchased a interest in a mw capacity gas fired generation facility in western washington  which went into service in april signed a two year purchase power agreement in the second quarter with another utility for mw of energy with delivery beginning january  signed a non binding letter of intent in september to purchase a wind generation facility with up to mw of generation to be developed in central washington state 
signed a non binding letter of intent in october to purchase a wind generation facility with up to mw of generation to be developed in eastern washington state 
these transactions and proposed transactions are part of pse s long term electric least cost plan that was filed august  with the washington commission 
the plan supports a strategy of diverse resource acquisitions including resources fueled by natural gas and coal  renewable resources and shared resources 
pse is in the process of updating its least cost plan and expects to file the updated plan with the washington commission in the first half of infrastrux following a strategic review of infrastrux conducted by puget energy management  on february   puget energy s board of directors decided to exit the utility construction services sector 
during  puget energy intends to monetize its interest in infrastrux through a sale or third party recapitalization and to invest the proceeds in pse 
the costs associated with exiting the infrastrux business cannot be quantified at this time 
however  puget energy believes that such costs will not be material given the effects of the impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter infrastrux generates revenues mainly from maintenance services and construction contracts in the midwest  texas  south central and eastern united states 
generally  the majority of its revenues are generated during the second and third quarters  which are typically the most productive quarters for the construction industry due to longer daylight hours and generally better weather conditions 
infrastrux is subject to risks associated with the construction industry  including inability to adequately estimate costs of projects that are bid on under fixed fee contracts  continued economic downturn that limits the amount of projects available thereby reducing available profit margins due to increased competition  the ability to integrate acquired companies within its operations without significant cost  and the ability to obtain adequate financing and bonding coverage to continue expansion and growth 
infrastrux s main goals have been continued growth and expansion into underdeveloped utility construction markets and to utilize its acquired entities to capitalize on depth of expertise  asset base  geographical location and workforce to provide services that local contractors cannot provide 
infrastrux has acquired entities since financial condition and results of operations puget energy all the operations of puget energy are conducted through its subsidiaries  pse and infrastrux 
net income in was million on operating revenues of billion compared to million on operating revenues of billion in and million on operating revenues of billion in basic earnings per share in were on million weighted average common shares outstanding compared to on million weighted average common shares outstanding in and on million weighted average common shares outstanding in diluted earnings per share in were on million weighted average common shares outstanding compared to on million weighted average common shares outstanding in and on million weighted average common shares outstanding in net income in was adversely impacted by an infrastrux non cash goodwill impairment charge of million million after tax and minority interest and a million million after tax disallowance of the return on the tenaska gas supply regulatory asset as a result of a washington commission order in pse s power cost only rate case pcorc 
net income was also negatively impacted by an increase in depreciation expense of million  primarily due to the acquisition of frederickson and other pse infrastructure projects 
these negative impacts were offset by improved electric margins of million compared to and lower interest expense at pse of million 
in addition  was not impacted by one time tax benefits of million or the write down of million in the carrying value of a non utility venture capital investment in net income in was positively impacted by a million increase in infrastrux s net income  excluding the goodwill impairment charge and net of minority interest 
the net income increase at infrastrux was due to improved operating efficiencies and improvements in weather conditions compared to  which positively impacted productivity 
net income in was positively impacted by an increase in pse s net income of million due to increased electric and gas margins primarily from a general gas rate increase effective september  and from increased sales volumes for electric and gas loads compared to in addition  net income in was positively impacted by lower interest expenses of million 
this was offset by a million downward adjustment in the carrying value of a non utility venture capital investment in the fourth quarter  a million increase in depreciation and amortization  and an million decrease in gains on derivative instruments due to a gain from de designated contracts from a non creditworthy counterparty under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in addition  federal tax benefits decreased in to million compared to million in net income was also negatively impacted by a decrease in infrastrux s net income of million in compared to  net of minority interest  due to unusually wet weather affecting productivity in the first quarter and increased competition in the marketplace 
puget sound energy pse s operating revenues and associated expenses are not generated evenly during the year 
variations in energy usage by consumers occur from season to season and from month to month within a season  primarily as a result of weather conditions 
pse normally experiences its highest retail energy sales during the heating season in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
varying wholesale electric prices and the amount of hydroelectric energy supplies available to pse also make quarter to quarter comparisons difficult 
puget sound energy compared to energy margins the following table displays the details of electric margin changes from to electric margin dollars in millions twelve months ended december change percent change electric retail sales revenue electric transportation revenue other electric revenue gas supply resale total electric revenue for margin adjustments for amounts included in revenue pass through tariff items pass through revenue sensitive taxes residential exchange credit net electric revenue for margin minus power costs fuel purchased electricity  net of sales to other utilities and marketers total electric power costs electric margin before pca tenaska disallowance reserve through may  tenaska reserve turnaround power cost deferred under the pca mechanism electric margin percent change not applicable 
electric margin increased million in compared to due primarily to an increase in kwh sales and the pcorc rate increase 
pse incurred million in excess power costs in before reaching the million pca mechanism cap in in addition  the pcorc rate increase of related to the frederickson generating facility became effective on may  this rate increase provided an additional million to electric margin in to recover utility operation and maintenance costs  depreciation and property taxes related to the frederickson generating facility 
also  retail customer kwh sales residential  commercial and industrial customers increased in compared to  which along with a change in customer class usage provided an additional million to electric margin 
these increases were partially offset by the disallowance of certain gas costs for the tenaska generating facility also ordered in the pcorc  which resulted in a million reduction of electric margin in in addition  a charge of million associated with colstrip units coal supply repricing arbitration and colstrip units royalty charge resulted in a negative impact to electric margin 
electric margin is electric sales to retail and transportation customers less pass through tariff items and revenue sensitive taxes  and the cost of generating and purchasing electric energy sold to customers including transmission costs to bring electric energy to pse s service territory 
the following table displays the details of gas margin changes from to gas margin dollars in million twelve months ended december change percent change gas retail revenue gas transportation revenue total gas revenue for margin adjustments for amounts included in revenue gas revenue hedge pass through tariff items pass through revenue sensitive taxes net gas revenue for margin minus purchased gas costs gas margin percent change not applicable 
gas margin decreased million in compared to primarily due to overall warmer weather in compared to  partially offset by customer additions in heating degree days decreased in compared to  which resulted in a reduction in therm sales 
gas margin is gas sales to retail and transportation customers less pass through tariff items and revenue sensitive taxes and the cost of gas purchased  including gas transportation costs to bring gas to pse s service territory 
electric operating revenues the table below sets forth changes in electric operating revenues for pse from to dollars in millions twelve months ended december change percent change electric operating revenues residential sales commercial sales industrial sales transportation sales sales to other utilities and marketers other total electric operating revenues electric operating revenues increased million in compared to due to increases in residential and commercial customer usage and the effect of the pcorc rate increase 
residential and commercial electricity usage increased  mwh or and  mwh or  respectively  from the increase in electricity usage was mainly the result of a higher average number of customers served in compared to average customers for the residential and commercial customer classes increased and  respectively  from in addition  the pcorc rate increase became effective on may  and provided a million increase in electric operating revenue  net of a million rate reduction due to the tenaska disallowance 
sales to other utilities and marketers decreased million from primarily due to higher retail electric sales  which reduced excess generation for sale to the wholesale market 
in  warmer than normal temperatures  mainly in the first quarter  and improved hydroelectric conditions as compared to the original hydroelectric forecast provided excess energy supplies for sale to the wholesale market 
during  the benefits of the residential and farm energy exchange benefit credited to customers reduced electric operating revenues by million compared to million in this credit also reduces power costs by a corresponding amount with no impact on earnings 
see item  business regulation and rates residential and small farm exchange benefit credit for further discussion 
during  pse collected in its electric general rate tariff as a reduction to revenue and remitted to a grantor trust million 
this was a result of pse s sale of future electric revenues associated with its investment in conservation assets 
the impact of the sale of revenue was offset by reductions in conservation amortization and interest expense 
pse s conservation trust transaction was consolidated in the third quarter to meet the guidance of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin and  as a result  revenues increased million in while conservation amortization and interest expense increased by a corresponding amount with no impact on earnings 
the conservation trust assets were fully satisfied during september gas operating revenues the table below sets forth changes in gas operating revenues for pse from to dollars in millions twelve months ended december change percent change gas operating revenues residential sales commercial sales industrial sales transportation sales other total gas operating revenues gas operating revenues increased million or in compared to due primarily to higher purchased gas adjustment pga mechanism rates in the pga mechanism rate charged to customers has increased twice since april reflecting the higher cost of natural gas provided to customers 
on september   the washington commission approved a pga mechanism rate increase of annually across all classes of customers effective october  in addition  the washington commission approved a third pga mechanism rate increase effective october  that increased rates annually 
the pga mechanism passes through to customers increases or decreases in the gas supply portion of the natural gas service rates based upon changes in the price of natural gas purchased from producers and wholesale marketers or changes in gas pipeline transportation costs 
pse s gas margin and net income are not affected by changes under the pga mechanism 
for  the effects of the pga mechanism rate increases provided an increase of million in gas operating revenues 
these rate increases were partially offset with lower therm sales due to fewer heating degree days in compared to 
table of contents operating expenses the table below sets forth significant changes in operating expenses for pse and its subsidiaries from to dollars in millions twelve months ended december change percent change purchased electricity electric generation fuel purchased gas utility operations and maintenance depreciation and amortization conservation amortization taxes other than income taxes income taxes purchased electricity expenses increased million in compared to as a result of a million disallowance associated with the tenaska generating facility as ordered by the washington commission in the pcorc 
this decrease was partially offset by lower purchases of electricity due to increased generation at pse generating facilities 
total generation at pse generating facilities in increased  mwh or in compared to pse s hydroelectric production and related power costs in and have continued to be negatively impacted by below normal winter precipitation and reduced snow pack in the pacific northwest region 
the january  columbia basin runoff summary published by the national weather service northwest river forecast center indicated that the total observed runoff above grand coulee reservoir for the period january through december was of normal  which compares to of normal for the same period in pse cannot determine if this trend of lower than normal runoff will continue in future years nor what impact such a trend may have on the amount of electricity that will need to be purchased 
pse had previously reached the million cumulative cap under the pca mechanism in primarily due to increased power costs and adverse hydroelectric conditions 
in  pse fell below the million cumulative cap due to the tenaska disallowance 
under the pca mechanism  continued excess power costs and further increases in variable power costs through june  will be apportioned to customers and to pse 
pse has reserved the tenaska disallowance and as a result any future excess power costs will be offset by the reserve 
for further discussion see item business regulation and rates electric regulation and rates washington commission matters 
to meet customer demand  pse economically dispatches resources in its power supply portfolio such as fossil fuel generation  owned and contracted hydroelectric capacity and energy  and long term contracted power 
however  depending principally upon availability of hydroelectric energy  plant availability  fuel prices and or changing load as a result of weather  pse may sell surplus power or purchase deficit power in the wholesale market 
pse manages its core energy portfolio through short term and intermediate term off system physical purchases and sales  and through other risk management techniques 
electric generation fuel expense increased million in compared to as a result of higher fuel costs for pse controlled gas fired generation facilities and the addition of the frederickson generating facility  which was purchased and went into service in april in addition  the months ended december  includes a million charge related to a binding arbitration settlement between pse and western energy company weco  the supplier of coal to colstrip units the binding decision retroactively set a new baseline cost per ton of coal supplied from july   and is applicable to the remaining term of the coal supply agreement through december of the million charge  million is included in the pca mechanism 
pse had previously accrued a reserve of million in the fourth quarter related to the arbitration 
the months ended december  also includes a loss reserve of million recorded in the second quarter related to an order issued to weco by the minerals management services of the united states department of the interior mms on april   to pay additional royalties concerning coal purchased by pse for colstrip units the order seeks payment of royalties for coal mined from federal land between and june  during that period  pse s coal price was reduced by a settlement agreement entered into in february among pse  weco and montana power company that resolved disputes that were then pending 
the order seeks to impute the price charged to pse based on the other colstrip units owners contractual amounts 
pse is supporting weco s appeal of the order  but is also evaluating the basis of the claim 
in addition  the mms issued two orders to weco in and to pay additional royalties concerning coal sold to colstrip units owners 
the orders assert that additional royalties are owed as a result of weco not paying royalties in connection with revenue received by weco from the colstrip units owners under a coal transportation agreement during the period october  through december  pse s share of the alleged additional royalties is million  which is equivalent to pse s ownership interest in colstrip units other parties may attempt to assert claims against weco if the mms position prevails 
the transportation agreement provides for the construction and operation of a conveyor system that runs several miles from the mine to colstrip units weco has appealed these orders and pse is monitoring the process 
based upon its review  pse believes that the colstrip units owners have reasonable defenses in this matter 
neither the outcome of this matter nor the associated costs can be predicted at this time 
purchased gas expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to an increase in pga rates as approved by the washington commission 
the pga mechanism allows pse to recover expected gas costs  and defer  as a receivable or liability  any gas costs that exceed or fall short of this expected gas cost amount in pga mechanism rates  including accrued interest 
the pga mechanism had a receivable balance at december  of million compared to a liability balance of million at december  a receivable balance in the pga mechanism reflects a current underrecovery of market gas cost through rates and a liability balance reflects a current overrecovery of gas cost 
for further discussion on pga rates see item business gas regulation and rates 
utility operations and maintenance expense increased million in compared to which includes a decrease of million related to low income program costs that are passed through in retail rates with no impact on earnings 
as a result  the pre tax impact on net income from utility operations and maintenance was an increase of million due primarily to a million increase in storm damage costs primarily from a severe ice storm that hit the pacific northwest in january pse anticipates operation and maintenance expense to increase in future years as pse invests in new generating resources and energy delivery infrastructure 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million in compared to due primarily to the effects of new plant placed in service during  including million in costs for the frederickson generating facility and million for the everett delta gas transmission line 
pse anticipates depreciation expense will increase in future years as pse invests in new generating resources and energy delivery infrastructure 
conservation amortization decreased million in compared to due to the conservation trust assets being fully amortized in september conservation amortization is a pass through tariff item with no impact on earnings 
taxes other than income taxes increased million in compared to primarily due to increases in revenue based washington state excise tax and municipal tax due to increased operating revenues 
revenue sensitive excise and municipal taxes have no impact on earnings 
income taxes increased million in compared to as a result of the non recurrence in of million in income tax benefits in offset by a one time income tax benefit of million in related to a tax audit

off balance sheet arrangements accounts receivable securitization program in order to provide a source of liquidity to pse at an attractive cost  pse entered into a receivables sales agreement with rainier receivables  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of pse in december pursuant to the receivables sales agreement  pse sold all its utility customers accounts receivable and unbilled utility revenues to rainier receivables 
concurrently with entering into the receivables sales agreement  rainier receivables entered into a receivables purchase agreement with pse and a third party 
the receivables purchase agreement allows rainier receivables to sell the receivables purchased from pse to the third party 
the amount of receivables sold by rainier receivables is not permitted to exceed million at any time 
however  the maximum amount may be less than million depending on the outstanding eligible amount of pse s receivables  which fluctuate with the seasonality of energy sales to customers 
the receivables securitization facility is the functional equivalent of a revolving line of credit secured by receivables 
in the event rainier receivables elects to sell receivables under the receivables purchase agreement  rainier receivables is required to pay fees to the purchasers that are comparable to interest rates on a revolving line of credit 
as receivables are collected by pse as agent for the receivables purchasers  the outstanding amount of receivables held by the purchasers declines until rainier receivables elects to sell additional receivables to the purchasers 
the receivables securitization facility expires in december  but is terminable by pse and rainier receivables upon notice to the receivables purchasers 
at december   rainier receivables had fully utilized its million available balance under the receivable securitization facility  and therefore had no additional available balances to be sold under it

at december   pse s outstanding balance under the lease was million 
the expected residual value under the lease is the lesser of million or of the cost of the equipment 
in the event the equipment is sold to a third party upon termination of the lease and the aggregate sales proceeds are less than the unamortized value of the equipment  pse would be required to pay the lessor contingent rent in an amount equal to the deficiency up to a maximum of of the unamortized value of the equipment 
utility construction program utility construction expenditures for generation  transmission and distribution are designed to meet continuing customer growth and to improve efficiencies of pse s energy delivery systems 
construction expenditures  excluding equity allowance for funds used during construction afudc  were million in utility construction expenditures in  and are expected to be million  million and million  respectively  excluding amounts for new generation resources currently under evaluation 
new generation resources under evaluation consist of two separate wind generation projects that are anticipated to be completed in and  respectively 
the first project  if completed in  is anticipated to have a total cost of approximately million 
the second project  if completed in  is anticipated to have a total cost range of approximately to million 
the proposed utility construction expenditures and new generation resource expenditures  if acquired  are anticipated to be funded with a combination of short term debt  long term debt and equity 
construction expenditure estimates  including the new generation resources  are subject to periodic review and adjustment in light of changing economic  regulatory  environmental and efficiency factors 
new generation resources in april  pse completed the purchase of a interest in frederickson  a gas fired electric generating station located in western washington 
the purchase has added million in utility plant and approximately mw of electric generation capacity to serve pse s retail customers 
pse submitted a pcorc in october to the washington commission to recover the cost of the new generating facility and other power costs 
the acquisition of frederickson was approved by the washington commission on april  and was also approved by ferc under the federal power act on april  in september and october  pse signed two non binding letters of intent to obtain a ownership interest in both the proposed wild horse wind power project wild horse project and the hopkins ridge wind power project hopkins ridge project 
the projects are located in central and eastern washington state 
the wild horse project is expected to have approximately to wind turbines and generate from to mw of power or average mw  depending on the final design agreement 
the hopkins ridge project is expected to generate approximately mw of power or average mw 
both projects will require final binding agreements between pse and the developers 
such agreements are expected to be executed in other additions other property  plant and equipment additions were million in puget energy expects infrastrux s capital additions to be million in construction expenditure estimates are subject to periodic review and adjustment in light of changing economic  regulatory  environmental and efficiency factors 
capital resources cash from operations cash generated from operations for the year ended december  was million 
during that period  million in cash was used for afudc and payment of dividends 
consequently  cash flows available for utility construction expenditures and other capital expenditures were million or of the million in construction expenditures net of afudc and customer refundable contributions and other capital expenditure requirements for for the year ended december   cash generated from operations was million  million of which was used for afudc and payment of dividends 
therefore  cash flows available for utility construction expenditures and other capital expenditures were million  or of the million in construction expenditures net of afudc and customer refundable contributions and other capital expenditure requirements for the overall cash generated from operating activities in increased million compared to the increase was partially the result of increases in pga rates in april  october and october  combined with lower cash paid under the pga mechanism for liability balances in for a total positive cash flow of million 
cash from operating activities also increased million due to higher cash payments received from bpa than provided to customers under the residential exchange program compared to when pse provided customers more cash than bpa paid to pse 
in addition  changes in deferred taxes contributed million to positive cash flow 
in  pse did not fund the qualified pension plan compared to funding million in  which positively impacted cash flow from operating activities 
cash flow from operating activities also improved million through recovery of collateral deposits in compared to a return of collateral deposits in from energy supply counterparties 
financing program financing utility construction requirements and operational needs are dependent upon the cost and availability of external funds through capital markets and from financial institutions 
access to funds is dependent upon factors such as general economic conditions  regulatory authorizations and policies  and puget energy s and pse s credit ratings 
restrictive covenants in determining the type and amount of future financing  pse may be limited by restrictions contained in its electric and gas mortgage indentures  articles of incorporation and certain loan agreements 
the goodwill impairment at puget energy does not cause any violations of financial covenants at puget energy or pse 
under the most restrictive tests  at december   pse could issue approximately million of additional first mortgage bonds under pse s electric mortgage indenture based on approximately million of electric bondable property available for issuance  subject to an interest coverage ratio limitation of times net earnings available for interest  which pse exceeded at december   approximately million of additional first mortgage bonds under pse s gas mortgage indenture based on approximately million of gas bondable property available for issuance  subject to an interest coverage ratio limitation of times net earnings available for interest  which pse exceeded at december   approximately million of additional preferred stock at an assumed dividend rate of  and approximately million of unsecured long term debt 
at december   pse had approximately billion in electric and gas ratebase to support the interest coverage ratio limitation test for net earnings available for interest 
credit ratings neither puget energy nor pse has had any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt 
however  a downgrade in the companies credit ratings could adversely affect their ability to renew existing  or obtain access to new  credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities 
for example  under pse s revolving credit facility  the spreads over the index and commitment fee increase as pse s secured long term debt ratings decline 
a downgrade in commercial paper ratings could preclude pse s ability to issue commercial paper under its current programs 
the marketability of pse commercial paper is currently limited by the a p ratings by standard poor s and moody s investors service 
in addition  downgrades in any or a combination of pse s debt ratings may allow counterparties on a contract by contract basis in the wholesale electric  wholesale gas and financial derivative markets to require pse to post a letter of credit or other collateral  make cash prepayments  obtain a guarantee agreement or provide other mutually agreeable security

other tenaska disallowance the washington commission issued an order on may  determining that pse did not prudently manage gas costs for the tenaska electric generating plant and ordered pse to adjust its pca deferral account to reflect a disallowance of million for the pca period july  through june   which was recorded by pse as a purchased electricity expense in the second quarter the order also established guidelines for future recovery of tenaska costs 
the amounts were determined to be a million disallowance for the pca period and an estimated disallowance of million for the pca period july  to june   based upon applying the washington commission s methodology of disallowance on the return on the tenaska regulatory asset due to projected costs exceeding the benchmark during the period 
for the pca period  approximately million was disallowed in the period july  through december   primarily as a reduction to electric operating revenue 
while the washington commission did not expressly address the disallowance for the pca period july  through june   pse estimated the disallowance for the pca period to be approximately million if the washington commission were to follow the same methodology as they have ordered for the pca period 
therefore  pse recorded a million disallowance to purchased electricity expense in the second quarter for the disallowance of the return on the tenaska regulatory asset in accordance with the washington commission s methodology discussed in its order of may  for a cumulative impact on earnings of million in for the pca  pca and pca periods 
as a result of the disallowance recorded  the pca customer deferral was expensed and a reserve was established for amounts not previously deferred under the pca mechanism 
the reserve balance as of december  was million  which is expected to be utilized in as excess power costs are shared through the pca mechanism 
pse filed the pca period compliance filing in august and received an order from the washington commission on february  in the pca compliance order  the washington commission approved the washington commission staff s recommendation for an additional return related to the tenaska regulatory asset in the amount of million related to the period july  through december  washington commission staff s recommendation was opposed by certain other parties 
this amount alters the pca deferral and is subject to reconsideration and appeal by other parties 
parties have days from february  to file for reconsideration and days to appeal the order 
once the statutory appeal process has concluded and the washington commission issues its final order  pse will determine if recording a regulatory asset is appropriate 
in the may  order  the washington commission established guidelines and a benchmark to determine pse s recovery on the tenaska regulatory asset starting with the pca period july  through the expiration of the tenaska contract in the year the benchmark is defined as the original cost of the tenaska contract adjusted to reflect the disallowance from a prudence order 

table of contents below is a summary of the tenaska disallowances by quarter through december dollars in millions quarter ending pca ordered final pca estimated pca estimated total june  september  december  total the washington commission guidelines for determining future recovery of the tenaska costs gas costs  recovery of the tenaska regulatory asset and return on the tenaska regulatory asset are as follows the washington commission will determine if pse s gas purchasing plan and gas purchases for tenaska are prudent through the pca compliance filings 
if pse s gas purchasing plan and gas purchases for tenaska are prudent  and if pse s actual tenaska costs fall at or below the benchmark  it will fully recover its tenaska costs 
if pse s gas purchasing plan and gas purchases for tenaska are prudent  but its actual tenaska costs exceed the benchmark  pse will only recover of the lesser of a actual tenaska costs that exceed the benchmark  or b the return on the tenaska regulatory asset 
if pse s gas purchasing plan or gas purchases are found to be imprudent in a future proceeding  pse risks disallowance of any and all tenaska costs 
the washington commission confirmed that if the tenaska gas costs are deemed prudent  pse will recover the full amount of actual gas costs and the recovery of the tenaska regulatory asset even if the benchmark is exceeded 
the projected costs and projected benchmark costs for tenaska have been updated as of december  to reflect higher forward gas prices and are as follows dollars in millions projected tenaska costs projected tenaska benchmark costs over under benchmark costs projected disallowance based on washington commission methodology projection will change based on market conditions of gas and replacement power costs 

table of contents proceedings relating to the western power market the following discussion summarizes the status as of the date of this report of ongoing proceedings in which pse is a party relating to the western power markets 
pse intends to vigorously defend against each of these cases and does not expect the ultimate resolution of these proceedings in the aggregate to have a material adverse impact on the financial condition  results of operations or liquidity of the company 
however  there can be no assurances in that regard because litigation is subject to numerous uncertainties and pse is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters 
accordingly  there can be no guarantee that these proceedings  either individually or in the aggregate  will not materially and adversely affect pse s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
california receivable and california refund proceeding 
in  pg e and southern california edison failed to pay the california independent system operator corporation caiso and the california px for energy purchases 
the caiso in turn failed to pay various energy suppliers  including pse  for energy sales made by pse into the california energy market during the fourth quarter both pg e and the california px filed for bankruptcy in  further constraining pse s ability to receive payments due to bankruptcy court controls placed on the distribution of funds by the california px and the escrow of funds owed by pg e for purchases during the fourth quarter are owed by the california px 
a 
california refund proceeding 
on july   ferc ordered an evidentiary hearing docket no 
el to determine the amount of refunds due to california energy buyers for purchases made in the spot markets operated by the caiso and the california px during the period october  through june  refund period 
the caiso continues its efforts to prepare revised settlement statements based on newly recalculated costs and charges for spot market sales to california during the refund period and currently estimates that it will determine who owes what to whom in early on september   ferc issued an order selecting ernst young llp as the independent auditor of fuel cost allowance claims made by sellers  including pse 
a review of that claim is pending  awaiting further guidance from ferc 
many of the numerous orders that ferc issued in docket no 
el are on appeal and have been consolidated before the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit as a result of a case management conference conducted on september  ferc filed the record on november  the ninth circuit ordered on october  that briefing proceed in two rounds 
the first round is limited to three issues which parties are subject to ferc s refund jurisdiction in light of the exemption for government owned utilities in section f of the federal power act fpa  the temporal scope of refunds under section of the fpa  which categories of transactions are subject to refunds 
procedures will be established for the remaining issues  if necessary  after the court s disposition of the first round of issues 
following a second case management conference on november   the ninth circuit consolidated certain petitions for review for briefing of the first round of issues to be completed by march  and set oral argument hearings for april and  opening briefs were filed on december  pse joined the brief of the competitive supplier group  which argued that ferc has proposed to require payment of refunds without proper notice to sellers  without proper limits on the type of transactions affected and without a finding that the transactions subject to refund in fact produced prices that were just and reasonable 
respondents briefs in support of ferc were due february  b 
caiso receivable 
pse has a bad debt reserve and a transaction fee reserve applied to the caiso receivable  such that pse s net receivable from the caiso as of december  is approximately million 
pse estimates the range for the receivable to be between million and million  which includes estimated credits for fuel and power purchase costs and interest 
in its october  order on rehearing in this docket  ferc expressly adopted and approved a stipulation that confirmed that two of pse s non spot market transactions are not subject to mitigation in the refund proceeding 
on october   pse formally presented caiso with a request that payment be made on these amounts 
the caiso responded to the letter on november   expressing an unwillingness to take the issue up separately or in advance of its cost re run activities 
pse continues to pursue the issue in filings through ferc processes 
on may   the los angeles department of water and power filed a motion at ferc in docket no 
el requesting that ferc issue an order permitting monies to be disbursed from the california px settlement clearing account and an escrow account be established as part of pg e s bankruptcy proceeding 
the bulk of the monies owed by the caiso  including the monies owed to pse  are held in those two accounts 
pse filed an answer in support of the motion on may   and awaits an order from ferc 
pacific northwest refund proceeding 
in october  pse filed a complaint at ferc docket no 
el against all jurisdictional sellers in the pacific northwest seeking prospective price caps consistent with any result ferc supplied for the california markets 
ferc dismissed pse s complaint on december   although pse filed for rehearing in january when ferc issued its june  order in docket no 
el  imposing west wide price constraints on energy sales  pse moved to withdraw its rehearing request and its complaint in docket no 
el  on the basis that the relief pse sought was fully provided 
various parties  including the port of seattle and the cities of seattle and tacoma  moved to intervene in the proceeding 
they asserted the ability to adopt pse s complaint to obtain retroactive refunds for numerous transactions  including many that were not within the scope of the pse complaint 
the proceeding became commonly referenced as the pacific northwest refund proceeding  despite the fact that the original complainant  pse  did not seek retroactive refunds 
a preliminary evidentiary hearing was held in september  and an administrative law judge recommendation against refunds followed 
in december  ferc issued an order permitting additional discovery and the submission of any additional evidence parallel to the order issued in the california refund proceeding that reopened the matter to permit parties to introduce any evidence they claimed to have of market manipulation 
a few parties made filings  asserting market manipulation in early march  and numerous parties  including pse  responded to those allegations in late march on june   ferc issued an order terminating the proceeding  largely on procedural  jurisdictional and equitable grounds 
various parties filed rehearing requests on july  on november   ferc affirmed an order terminating the pacific northwest refund proceeding  docket no 
el  largely on procedural  jurisdictional and equitable grounds 
seven petitions for review  including pse s  are now pending before the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
opening briefs were filed on january  pse s opening brief addressed procedural flaws underlying the action of ferc 
specifically  pse argued that because pse s complaint in the underlying docket was withdrawn as a matter of law on july   ferc erred in relying on it to serve as the basis to initiate a preliminary investigation into whether refunds for individually negotiated bilateral transactions in the pacific northwest were appropriate 
briefing is expected to be completed in the first half of orders to show cause 
on june   ferc issued two show cause orders pertaining to its western market investigations that commenced individual proceedings against many sellers 
one show cause order docket nos 
el  et seq 
sought to investigate approximately entities that allegedly had potential partnerships with enron 
pse was not named in that show cause order 
in an order dismissing many of the already named respondents in the partnerships proceeding on january   ferc stated that it did not intend to proceed further against other parties 
the second show cause order docket nos 
el  et seq 
named pse docket no 
el and approximately other entities that allegedly had engaged in potential gaming practices in the caiso and california px markets 
pse and ferc staff filed a proposed settlement of all issues pending against pse in those proceedings on august  the proposed settlement  which admits no wrongdoing on the part of pse  would result in a payment of  to settle all claims 
ferc approved the settlement on january  the california parties filed for rehearing of that order  repeating arguments that had already been addressed by ferc 
on march   pse filed a motion to dismiss the california parties rehearing request  and awaits ferc action on that motion 
port of seattle suit 
on may   the port of seattle commenced suit in federal court in seattle against energy sellers  alleging that their conduct during and constituted market manipulation  violated antitrust laws and damaged the port of seattle 
the port had a contract to purchase its energy supply from pse at the time 
the port s contract linked the price of the energy sold to the port to an index price for energy sold at wholesale at the mid columbia trading hub 
the port alleged that the mid columbia price was inten tionally affected improperly by the defendants  including pse  and alleges damages of over million 
on may   the district court dismissed the lawsuit 
the port of seattle filed an appeal to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit  and on september   filed a brief in the ninth circuit arguing that the district court erred in dismissing its claims 
responses to the port s brief were filed november  the parties await oral argument to be scheduled 
wah chang v 
avista corp  pse and others 
in june  puget energy and pse were served a federal summons and complaint by wah chang  an oregon company 
wah chang claims that during through the company and other energy companies and in a separate complaint  energy marketers engaged in various fraudulent and illegal activities including the transmittal of electronic wire communications to transmit false or misleading information to manipulate the california energy market 
the claims include submitting false information such as energy schedules and bids to the california px  caiso  electronic trading platforms and publishers of energy indexes  alleges damages of not less than million and seeks treble and punitive damages  attorneys fees and costs 
the complaint is similar to the allegations made by the port of seattle currently on appeal in the ninth circuit 
the judicial panel on multi district litigation consolidated this case with another pending multi district case and transferred it to federal district court in san diego on august  the defendants in both cases filed motions to dismiss on october  wah chang opposed the motions to dismiss  and replies in support of the motions to dismiss were filed on january  on february   approximately three weeks after hearing oral argument  the court dismissed both cases on the grounds that ferc has the exclusive jurisdiction over plaintiff s claims and the filed rate doctrine and federal preemption barred the court from hearing the plaintiff s claims 
california litigation 
attorney general cases 
on may   ferc conditionally dismissed a complaint filed on march  by the california attorney general in docket no 
el that alleged violations of the fpa by ferc and all sellers including pse of electric power and energy into california 
the complaint asserted that ferc s adoption and implementation of market rate authority was flawed and  as a result  individual sellers such as pse were liable for sales of energy at rates that were unjust and unreasonable 
the condition for dismissal was that all sellers refile transaction summaries of sales to and  after a clarifying order issued on june   purchases from certain california entities during and pse refiled such transaction summaries on july and july  the order of dismissal went on appeal to the ninth circuit court of appeals 
on september   the ninth circuit issued a decision on the california attorney general s challenge to the validity of ferc s market based rate system lockyer v 
ferc 
this case was originally presented to ferc 
the ninth circuit upheld ferc s authority to authorize sales of electric energy at market based rates  but found the requirement that all sales at market based rates be contained in quarterly reports filed with ferc to be integral to a market based rate tariff 
the california parties  among others  have interpreted the decision as providing authority to ferc to order refunds for different time frames and based on different rationales than are currently pending in the california refund proceedings  discussed above in california refund proceeding 
the decision itself defers the question of whether to seek refunds to ferc 
pse  along with other defendants in the proceeding  sought rehearing of the ninth circuit s decision on october  the ninth circuit has yet to issue an order on the rehearing request 
because the current ninth circuit decision may open new periods of transactions to refund claims under new theories  pse cannot predict the scope  nature or ultimate resolution of this case 
that additional uncertainty may make the outcomes of certain other western energy market cases less predictable than previously anticipated 
in addition  the day after the initial ferc decision in the lockyer case  the california attorney general filed similar claims in state court in california  including one suit against pse 
these complaints alleged that the wholesale seller defendants in the california energy market engaged in anti competitive behavior in violation of the california business practices act for sales in the california energy market lockyer v 
transalta 
the complaint asserted that each such violation subjects pse to a fine of up to  plus an award of attorneys fees and asserts that there were thousands of such violations 
those cases were removed to federal court and dismissed 
on october   the ninth circuit issued a decision affirming the dismissal of all complaints filed by the california attorney general  including a complaint against pse 
the ninth circuit decision concluded that the opinions in people of the state of california ex rel 
bill lockyer v 
dynegy  et al 
and public utility district no 
of snohomish county v 
dynegy power marketing  inc  decided earlier this year by the ninth circuit  controlled the outcome of the matters and warranted dismissal 
because no party sought rehearing or filed a petition for certiorari to the supreme court of the united states  the ninth circuit s order is the final determination of this matter 
california class actions 
in may  pse was served with two cross complaints  by reliant energy services and duke energy trading marketing  respectively  in six consolidated class actions filed in superior court in san diego  california 
plaintiffs in the lawsuit seek  among other things  restitution of all funds acquired by means that violate the law and payment of treble damages  interest and penalties 
the cross complaints asserted essentially that the cross defendants  including pse  were also participants in the california energy market at the relevant times  and that any remedies ordered against some market participants should be ordered against all 
reliant and duke also seek indemnification and conditional relief as buyers in transactions involving cross defendants should the plaintiffs prevail 
the case was removed to federal court and some of the newly added defendants  including pse  moved to dismiss the action 
in december  the federal district court remanded the proceeding to state court  an action which duke and reliant later appealed to the ninth circuit 
the appeal stayed further action in the state court proceeding pending the outcome of the appeal 
the cross complaints and the addition of the new defendants raised issues of foreign sovereign immunity  jurisdiction and indemnity in the case  all of which are now part of the appeal 
in june  pse and other defendants filed motions to respond to the indemnity issues 
on may   the ninth circuit issued an order granting pse status as a cross appellant but did not permit pse to participate in the oral argument heard on june  on december   the ninth circuit issued an opinion affirming the district court s decision to remand the case to state court 
powerex filed a petition for rehearing which argues that although not immune from suit  as a government entity it should be allowed to litigate in federal  not state court 
powerex s petition for rehearing stays issuance of the mandate to remand pending the outcome of its rehearing request 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
the following accounting policies represent those that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates  assumptions and judgment to describe matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition utility revenues are recognized when the basis of service is rendered  which includes estimates to determine amounts relating to services rendered but not billed 
unbilled electricity revenue is determined by taking mwh generated and purchased less estimated system losses and billed mwh plus unbilled mwh balance at the last true up date 
the estimated system loss percentage for electricity is determined by reviewing historical billed mwh to generated and purchased mwh 
the estimated unbilled mwh balance is then multiplied by the estimated average revenue per mwh 
unbilled gas revenue is determined by taking therms delivered to pse less estimated system losses  prior month unbilled therms and billed therms 
the estimated system loss percentage for gas is determined by reviewing historical billed therms to therms delivered to customers 
the estimated current month unbilled therms is then multiplied by estimated average rate schedule revenue per therm 
non utility revenue is recognized when services are performed  upon the sale of assets  or on a percentage of completion basis for fixed price contracts 
the recognition of revenue is in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue 
the following table represents the sensitivity of the estimate of system losses for both electricity and gas in calculating unbilled revenues assuming an additional increase in the estimated system loss factor since the last annual true up gas revenue decrease millions electric revenue decrease millions increase in loss factor regulatory accounting as a regulated entity of the washington commission and ferc  pse prepares its financial statements in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
the application of sfas no 
results in differences in the timing and recognition of certain revenues and expenses in comparison with businesses in other industries 
the rates that are charged by pse to its customers are based on cost base regulation reviewed and approved by the washington commission and ferc 
under the authority of these commissions  pse has recorded certain regulatory assets and liabilities at december  in the amount of million and million  respectively  and regulatory assets and liabilities of million and million  respectively  at december  
pse expects to fully recover these regulatory assets and liabilities through its rates 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  pse would be required to write off these regulatory assets and liabilities 
in addition  if at some point in the future pse determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of sfas no 
 pse could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities 
also encompassed by regulatory accounting and subject to sfas no 
are the pca and pga mechanisms 
the pca and pga mechanisms mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility upon the company  and are approved by the washington commission 
the pca mechanism provides for a sharing of costs and benefits that are graduated over four levels of power cost variances with an overall cap of million plus of the excess over the million cap over the four year period ending june  the pca mechanism will continue after july   within certain sharing bands 
see item business regulation and rates electric regulation and rates for further discussion regarding the pca mechanism 
the pga mechanism passes through to customers increases and decreases in the cost of natural gas supply 
pse expects to fully recover these regulatory assets through its rates 
however  both mechanisms are subject to regulatory review and approval by the washington commission on a periodic basis 
derivatives puget energy uses derivative financial instruments primarily to manage its energy commodity price risks  and may enter into certain financial derivatives to manage interest rate risk 
derivative financial instruments are accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
accounting for derivatives continues to evolve through guidance issued by the derivatives implementation group dig of the financial accounting standards board fasb 
to the extent that changes by the dig modify current guidance  including the normal purchases and normal sales determination  the accounting treatment for derivatives may change 
to manage its electric and gas portfolios  puget energy enters into contracts to purchase or sell electricity and gas 
these contracts are considered derivatives under sfas no 
unless a determination is made that they qualify for normal purchases and normal sales exception 
if the exception applies  those contracts are not marked to market and are not reflected in the financial statements until delivery occurs 
the availability of the normal purchases and normal sales exception to specific contracts is based on a determination that a resource is available for a forward sale and similarly a determination that at certain times existing resources will be insufficient to serve load 
this determination is based on internal models that forecast customer demand and generation supply 
the models include assumptions regarding customer load growth rates  which are influenced by the economy  weather  the impact of customer choice and resource availability 
the critical assumptions used in the determination of the normal purchases and normal sales exception are consistent with assumptions used in the general planning process 
energy and financial contracts that are considered derivatives may be eligible for designation as cash flow hedges 
if a contract is designated as a cash flow hedge  the change in its market value is generally deferred as a component of other comprehensive income until the transaction it is hedging is completed 
conversely  the change in the market value of derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in current period earnings 
pse values derivative instruments based on daily quoted prices from numerous independent energy brokerage services 
when external quoted market prices are not available for derivative contracts  pse uses a valuation model that uses volatility assumptions relating to future energy prices based on specific energy markets and utilizes externally available forward market price curves 
all derivative instruments are sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis 
pension and other postretirement benefits puget energy has a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees of pse 
for  and  qualified pension income of million  million and million  respectively  was recorded in the financial statements 
of these amounts  approximately  and offset utility operations and maintenance expense in  and  respectively  and the remaining amounts were capitalized 
pse s pension and other postretirement benefits income or costs are dependent on several factors and assumptions  including design of the plan  timing and amount of cash contributions to the plan  earnings on plan assets  discount rate  expected long term rate of return and health care cost trends 
changes in any of these factors or assumptions will affect the amount of income or expense that puget energy records in its financial statements in future years and also its projected benefit obligation 
the follow table reflects the estimated sensitivity associated with a change in certain actuarial assumptions each assumption change is presented mutually exclusive of other assumption changes change in assumption impact on projected benefit obligation increase decrease impact on pension income increase decrease dollars in thousands pension benefits other benefits pension benefits other benefits increase in discount rate basis points decrease in discount rate basis points increase in return of plan assets basis points decrease in return on plan assets basis points calculation not applicable 
qualified pension income is expected to decline to million in as a result of lower actual returns on pension assets during the last three years and declining expected rates of return on pension fund assets 
during  pse made no cash contributions to the qualified defined benefit plan and expects to make no contributions in goodwill and intangibles puget energy only on january   sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and as a result puget energy ceased amortization of goodwill 
puget energy performs an annual impairment review to determine if any impairment exists 
in performing the goodwill impairment test  puget energy compares the present value of the future cash flows of estimated earnings of infrastrux which reflects prospective market price information from prospective buyers to the adjusted carrying value of recorded equity 
if goodwill is determined to have an impairment  puget energy will record in the period of determination an impairment charge to earnings 
intangibles with finite lives are amortized based on the expected pattern of use or on a straight line basis over the expected periods to be benefited 
the goodwill and intangibles recorded on the balance sheet of puget energy are the result of acquisition of companies by infrastrux 
during  puget energy recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  or million after tax and minority interest 
as a result  the goodwill balance at december  was million 
intangible assets have not been impaired and the balance at december  was million 
california reserve pse operates within the western wholesale market and has made sales into the california energy market 
at december   pse s receivables from the caiso and other counterparties  net of reserves  were million 
pse received the majority of the partial payments for sales made in the fourth quarter in the first quarter and has since received a small amount of payments 
at december   such receivables  net of reserves  were approximately million 
during  ferc issued an order in the california refund proceeding adopting in part and modifying in part ferc s earlier findings by the administrative law judge 
based on the order  pse has determined that the receivables balance at december  is collectible from the caiso 
new accounting pronouncements in december  fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  which revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r requires companies that issue share based payment awards to employees for goods or services to recognize as compensation expense  the fair value of the expected vested portion of the award as of the grant date over the vesting period of the award 
forfeitures that occur before the award vesting date will be adjusted from the total compensation expense  but once the award vests  no adjustment to compensation expense will be allowed for forfeitures or unexercised awards 
in addition  sfas no 
r would require recognition of compensation expense of all existing outstanding awards that are not fully vested for their remaining vesting period as of the effective date that were not accounted for under a fair value method of accounting at the time of their award 
sfas no 
r is effective for reporting periods beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating what impact the application of sfas no

fsp no 
states that the staff position related to deductions as a result of the american jobs creation act the act should be treated as a special deduction  as described in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes and therefore has no effect on deferred tax assets or liabilities existing at the enactment date 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of fsp no

accounting and disclosure requirements related to medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of as the result of the new medicare prescription drug and modernization act which was signed into law in december the law provides a subsidy for plan sponsors that provide prescription drug benefits to medicare beneficiaries that are equivalent to the medicare part d plan 
based on an actuarial assessment  pse will not be eligible for such subsidies  thus fsp no 
will have no impact on pse s retiree medical plans 
the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board eitf at its july meeting came to a consensus concerning eitf issue no 
 reporting realized gains and losses on derivative instruments that are subject to fasb statement no 
and not held for trading purposes as defined in issue no 
the consensus reached was that determining whether realized gains and losses on physically settled derivative contracts not held for trading purposes are reported in the income statement on a gross or net basis is a matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances 
based on the guidance by eitf no 
 the company determined that its non trading derivative instruments should be reported net and implemented this treatment effective january  as a result of the implementation  electric revenue and purchased electricity expense both decreased million in and million in  respectively  with no impact on financial position or net income 
in march  the eitf came to a consensus concerning eitf issue no 
 accounting for investments in limited liability companies 
the consensus reached was that an investment in a limited liability company should be accounted for using the equity method for investments greater than to 
the adoption of eitf no 
is effective for reporting periods beginning after june   with any adjustments being accounted for as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the company reviewed its investments and determined one investment held by pse met the criteria established in eitf no 
in may  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes the requirements for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations to redeem the financial instruments by the issuer 
the adoption of sfas no 
is effective with the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  however  on november  fasb deferred for an indefinite period certain mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests associated with finite lived subsidiaries 
the company does not have any noncontrolling interest in finite lived subsidiaries and therefore is not affected by the deferral 
prior periods will not be restated for the new presentation 
sfas no 
requires the company to classify its mandatorily redeemable preferred stock as liabilities 
as a result  the corresponding dividends on the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock are classified as interest expense on the income statement with no impact on net income 
in january  fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  as further revised in december with fin r  which clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have a controlling interest or sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support 
fin r requires that if a business entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  the financial statements must be included in the consolidated financial statements of the business entity 
the adoption of fin r for all interests in variable interest entities created after january  was effective immediately 
for variable interest entities created before february   it was effective july  the adoption of fin r was effective march  the company has evaluated its contractual arrangements and determined pse s conservation trust off balance sheet financing transaction meets this guidance  and therefore it was consolidated in the third quarter as a result  electricity revenues for increased million  while conservation amortization and interest expense increased by the corresponding amount with no impact on earnings 
fin r also impacted the treatment of the company s mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of a wholly owned subsidiary trust holding solely junior subordinated debentures of the corporation trust preferred securities 
previously  these trust preferred securities were consolidated into the company s operations 
as a result of fin r  these securities have been deconsolidated and were classified as junior subordinated debentures of the corporation payable to a subsidiary trust holding mandatorily redeemable preferred securities junior subordinated debt in the fourth quarter this change had no impact on the company s results of operations 
the company also evaluated its purchase power agreements and determined that three counterparties may be considered variable interest entities 
as a result  pse submitted requests for information to those parties  however  the parties have refused to submit to pse the necessary information for pse to determine whether they meet the requirements of a variable interest entity 
pse also determined that it does not have a contractual right to such information 
pse will continue to submit requests for information to the counterparties on a quarterly basis to determine if fin r is applicable 
for the three purchase power agreements that may be considered variable interest entities under fin r  pse is required to buy all the generation from these plants  subject to displacement by pse  at rates set forth in the purchase power agreements 
if at any time the counterparties cannot deliver energy to pse  pse would have to buy energy in the wholesale market at prices which could be higher or lower than the purchase power agreement prices 
pse s purchased electricity expense for and for these three entities was million and million  respectively 
in june  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  sfas no 
 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred 
upon initial recognition of a liability  that cost should be capitalized as part of the related long lived asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset 
the company adopted the new rules on asset retirement obligations on january  as a result  the company recorded a million charge to income for the cumulative effect of this accounting change 
in november  fasb reached a decision concerning a proposed interpretation of sfas no 
titled accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
the proposed interpretation addresses the issue of whether sfas no 
requires an entity to recognize a liability for a legal obligation to perform asset retirement when the asset retirement activities are conditional on a future event  and if so  the timing and valuation of the recognition 
the decision reached by fasb was that there are no instances where a law or regulation obligates an entity to perform retirement activities but then allows the entity to permanently avoid settling the obligation 
this  if part of the final issued interpretation  could potentially have an impact on the company as assets that were previously considered outside the scope of sfas no 
may be subject to the terms of the proposed interpretation 
fasb indicated that the final interpretation is anticipated to be issued in the first quarter  with an effective date for fiscal years ending after december   and with any adjustment accounted for as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
the company is currently evaluating what impact this proposed interpretation may have on the company if issued 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk energy portfolio management the regulatory mechanisms of the pga and the pca mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility on the company 
the pga mechanism passes through increases and decreases in the cost of natural gas supply to customers 
the pca mechanism provides for a sharing of costs and benefits that are graduated over four levels of power cost variances with an overall cap of million plus of the excess over the million cap over the four year period ending june  the company is focused on commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the gas portfolio and electric portfolio for its customers 
gas and electric portfolio exposure is managed in accordance with company polices and procedures 
the risk management committee  which is composed of company officers  provide policy level and strategic direction for management of the energy portfolio 
the audit committee of the company s board of directors periodically assesses risk management policies 
the nature of serving regulated electric customers with its wholesale portfolio of owned and contracted resources exposes the company and its customers to some volumetric and commodity price risks within the sharing mechanism of the pca 
the company s energy risk management function monitors and manages these risks using analytical models and tools 
the company manages its energy supply portfolio to achieve three primary objectives ensure that physical energy supplies are available to serve retail customer requirements  manage portfolio risks to limit undesired impacts on the company s costs  and maximize the value of the company s energy supply assets 
the company is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading revenues 
therefore wholesale market transactions are focused on balancing the company s energy portfolio  reducing costs and risks where feasible  and reducing volatility in wholesale costs and margin in the portfolio 
in order to manage risks effectively  the company enters into physical and financial transactions  which are appropriate for the service territory of the company and are relevant to its regulated electric and gas portfolios 
the risk metrics the company employs are aimed at assessing exposure for the purposes of developing strategies to reduce the potential exposure on a cost effective basis in regulated utility gas and electric portfolios 
specifically  the amount of risk exposure is defined by time period and by portfolio 
it is determined through statistical methods aimed at forecasting risk 
the energy risk management staff models forecasted load requirements and expected resource availability  and projects the net deficit or surplus position resulting from any imbalance between load requirements and existing resources 
however  the portfolios are subject to major sources of variability eg  hydroelectric generation  outage risk  regional economic factors  temperature sensitive retail sales and market prices for gas and power supplies 
at certain times  these sources of variability can mitigate portfolio imbalances and at other times they can exacerbate portfolio imbalances 
because of the volumetric and cost variability within the electric and gas portfolios  the company runs market simulations to model potential risk scenarios 
in this way  strategies can be developed to address the expected case as well as other potential scenarios 
resources in the gas portfolio include gas supply arrangements  gas storage and gas transportation contracts 
resources in the electric portfolio include power purchase agreements  generating resources and transmission contracts 
the company s energy risk management staff develops hedging strategies to manage deficit or surplus positions in the portfolios 
the company s energy risk policy states that hedging and optimization strategies will be consistent with company objectives 
the company relies on risk analysis  operational factors  professional judgment of its employees and fundamental analysis 
the company will engage in transactions that reduce risks in its electric and gas portfolios  and optimize unused capacity where possible 
cost and reliability factors are considered in its hedging strategies 
the company s hedging activities are aimed at removing risks from the company s electric and gas portfolios  giving important consideration to cost of hedges and lost opportunity in order to find a balance between price stability and least cost 
the hedge strategies for the gas and electric portfolios incorporate risk analysis  operational factors and professional judgment of its employees as well as fundamental analysis 
programmatic hedge plans are developed to ensure disciplined hedging  and discretion is used in hedging within specific guidelines of the programmatic hedge plans approved by the risk management committee 
most hedges can be implemented in ways that retain the company s ability to use its energy supply optimization opportunities 
some hedges are structured similarly to insurance instruments  where the company pays an insurance premium to protect against certain extreme conditions 
without jeopardizing the security of supply within its portfolio  the company also engages in optimizing the portfolio 
optimization may take the form of utilizing excess capacity  shaping flexible resources to capture their highest value and utilizing transmission capacity through third party transactions 
as a result  portions of the company s energy portfolio are monetized through the use of forward price instruments which help reduce overall costs 
the company has entered into master netting agreements with counterparties when available to mitigate credit exposure to those counterparties 
the company believes that entering into such agreements reduces risk of settlement default for the ability to make only one net payment 
in addition  the company believes risk is mitigated with an improved position in potential counterparty bankruptcy situations due to a consistent netting approach 
at december   the company was subject to a range of netting provisions  including both stand alone agreements and the provisions associated with the western systems power pool agreement of which many energy suppliers in the western united states are a part 
transactions that qualify as hedge transactions under sfas no 
are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in fair value of the company s derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income 
short term derivative contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity are valued based on daily quoted prices from an independent energy brokerage service 
valuations for short term and medium term natural gas financial derivatives are derived from a combination of quotes from several independent energy brokers and are updated daily 
long term gas financial derivatives are valued based on published pricing from a combination of independent brokerage services and are updated monthly 
option contracts are valued using market quotes and a monte carlo simulation based model approach 
at december   the company had an after tax net asset of approximately million of energy contracts designated as qualifying cash flow hedges and a corresponding unrealized gain recorded in other comprehensive income 
of the amount in other comprehensive income  of the mark to market gain beginning february  has been reclassified out of other comprehensive income to a deferred account in accordance with sfas no 
due to the company expecting to reach the million cap under the pca mechanism 
the company also had energy contracts that were marked to market at a gain of million after tax through current earnings for the months ended december  these mark to market adjustments were primarily the result of excluding certain contracts from the normal purchase normal sale exception under sfas no 
a portion of the mark to market adjustments beginning february   has been reclassified to a deferred account in accordance with sfas no 
due to the company expecting to reach the million cap under the pca mechanism 
the company also had a liability of approximately million of gas contracts 
all mark to market adjustments relating to the natural gas business have been reclassified to a deferred account in accordance with sfas no 
due to the pga mechanism 
the pga mechanism passes on to customers increases and decreases in the cost of natural gas supply 
a hypothetical increase in the market prices of natural gas and electricity would increase the fair value of qualifying cash flow hedges by approximately million after tax and would increase current earnings for those contracts marked to market in earnings by an immaterial amount

table of contents fair value of contracts with settlement during year source of fair value dollars in millions and thereafter total fair value prices actively quoted prices provided by other external sources prices based on models and other valuation methods interest rate risk the company believes its interest rate risk primarily relates to the use of short term debt instruments  variable rate notes and leases and long term debt financing needed to fund capital requirements 
the company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed rate debt of various maturities 
the company utilizes bank borrowings  commercial paper  line of credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization to meet short term cash requirements 
these short term obligations are commonly refinanced with fixed rate bonds or notes when needed and when interest rates are considered favorable 
the company may enter into swap instruments or other financial hedge instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with these debts

pse s carrying value and fair value of fixed rate long term debt in was  million and  million  respectively 
in the third quarter  the company entered into two treasury lock contracts to hedge against potential rising interest rate exposure for a debt offering anticipated to be performed in the first half of a treasury lock is a financial arrangement between the company and a counterparty whereby one of the parties will be required to make a payment to the other party on a specific valuation date based upon the change in value of a year treasury bond 
if interest rates rise related to the hedged debt from the date of issuance of the treasury lock instruments  the company would receive a payment from the counterparty for the change in the bond value 
alternatively  if interest rates decrease related to the hedged debt from the date of issuance of the treasury lock instruments  the company would pay the counterparty for the change in bond value 
these treasury lock contracts were designated under sfas no 
criteria as cash flow hedges  with all changes in market value for each reporting period being presented net of tax in other comprehensive income 
all financial hedge contracts of this type are reviewed by senior management and presented to the securities pricing committee of the board of directors  and are approved prior to execution 
at december   the unrealized loss associated with the two treasury lock contracts was million that qualify as cash flow hedges and is included in other comprehensive income 
a hypothetical decrease in the interest rate of a year treasury note would result in an additional loss of million net of tax in other comprehensive income 
the treasury lock contracts will settle completely in treasury lock contracts dollars in millions amounts fair value of contracts outstanding at december  contracts realized or otherwise settled during changes in fair values of derivatives fair value of contracts outstanding at december
