statement of income discussion the following table presents income loss from continuing operations and net income by segment for the years ended december   and in millions rail air specialty other intersegment 


income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations net income 
gatx provides services and products through three operating segments rail  air  and specialty 
management evaluates the performance of each segment based on several measures  including net income 
these results are used to assess performance and determine resource allocation among the segments 
gatx allocates corporate selling  general and administrative sg a expenses to the segments 
corporate sg a expenses relate to administration and support functions performed at the corporate office 
such expenses include information technology  corporate sg a  human resources  legal  financial support and executive costs 
directly attributable expenses are generally allocated to the segments and shared costs are retained in other 
amounts allocated to the segments are approximated based on management s best estimate and judgment of direct support services 
interest expense was allocated based upon a fixed leverage ratio for each individual operating segment across all reporting periods  expressed as a ratio of debt to equity 
rail s leverage ratio was set at  air s leverage ratio was set at and specialty s leverage ratio was set at interest expense not allocated was assigned to other in each period 
reflective of overall lower leverage at gatx  management expects that leverage ratios to be utilized in will be modified to at rail and at air 
specialty will be unchanged at management believes this leverage and interest expense allocation methodology applies an appropriate cost of capital for purposes of evaluating each operating segment s risk adjusted financial return 
taxes are allocated to each segment based on the segment s contribution to gatx s overall tax position

gatx rail improving market conditions in the north american rail industry favorably impacted rail s results in  as rail experienced increasing lease rates and utilization levels 
demand for railcars was boosted by increased car loadings and ton miles  and most car types realized a more balanced supply demand profile 
the improving market conditions  higher lease rates and high levels of utilization are expected to continue during the full impact of higher lease rates will be felt gradually  as only of rail s north american fleet comes up for renewal each year 
during  approximately  cars were either renewed or assigned to new customers 
reversing a trend evident in recent years  rail experienced an improving pricing environment as progressed 
rail is optimistic that the positive pricing momentum will carry over into as a result  rail anticipates that  on average  the approximately  cars up for renewal in will be renewed or assigned at rates higher than the previous contract rate 
utilization of rail s north american fleet improved during from to by year end 
the increase resulted from the successful placement of new and acquired railcars with customers  the movement of railcars from idle to active status  and the scrapping of railcars 
in north america  rail acquired approximately  railcars in  including approximately  new railcars and  used railcars purchased in the secondary market 
the new cars were primarily purchased under pre existing contracts with railcar manufacturers that provided rail with a cost advantage versus a spot purchase in the current market 
rail also increased its presence in the locomotive leasing market by acquiring the remaining ownership interest of the locomotive leasing partners  llc llp joint venture in the fourth quarter 
costs for maintaining the north american fleet continued to increase in  primarily due to increased maintenance activity related to preparing cars in storage for active service 
the trend of increasing maintenance costs is expected to continue due to increasing costs associated with regulatory compliance and required maintenance as a result of the fact that a large number of cars purchased in the mid to late s are approaching their year regulatory inspections 
there is also the possibility that additional security and safety regulations may be enacted  increasing future maintenance costs 
rail s european operations experienced stable market conditions during rail europe was successful in placing new cars in existing markets  as well as placing cars in new eastern european markets  such as romania and bulgaria 
rail acquired the remaining interest in a leading european tank car lessor kvg kesselwagen vermietgesellschaft mbh  and kvg kesselwagen vermietgesellschaft mbh collectively kvg in generally  utilization remained high during  but kvg began to see some weakness in the chemical market 
rail purchased dyrekcja eksploatacji cystern sp 
zoo dec in during  major steps were taken in dec s transition from a trip lease to a term rental business model  culminating with signing its two largest customers to term rental agreements 
other transition efforts included the closing of redundant repair centers 
this transition is expected to stabilize revenues  reduce operating costs and make additional cars available for lease 
the aae cargo ag aae joint venture owned continued to experience strong demand for the majority of its fleet  particularly inter modal cars  due to high seaport volumes  growth in the containerization of freight traffic  and increased demand from private operators 
the strengthening of the euro and the zloty during positively impacted rail s european results 
the long term outlook for the european market remains positive  as the european union eu is encouraging the use of railways in place of the congested road system 
poland and nine other countries joined the eu in  which is expected to eventually lead to more seamless borders  upgraded infrastructure and improved rail efficiency in those countries 
operationally  kvg and dec continue to integrate their tank car operations

the increase in was driven primarily by higher lease income  higher asset remarketing income for both rail and its affiliates as the rail market continues to improve and larger gains on scrapping of railcars as a result of higher steel prices  partially offset by higher maintenance and ownership costs 
gross income rail s gross income of million was million higher than due primarily to favorable north american market conditions and higher scrapping gains resulting from higher scrap metal prices 
north american renewal and assignment activity was strong in and the active fleet increased by approximately  railcars 
rail s secondary market acquisitions and new railcar investments significantly contributed to the increase in active cars and the corresponding increase in lease income 
north american utilization improved to at december  representing approximately  railcars on lease compared to at december  with approximately  of railcars on lease 
in  the average renewal rate on a basket of common railcar types increased versus the expiring rate  with this improvement largely attributable to activity in the second half of the year 
the impact of this improvement on earnings will be reflected in rail s financial results gradually as rate changes move slowly through the fleet due to the term nature of the business 
we expect this improvement to continue in also favorably impacting rail s gross income was the impact of foreign exchange rates and higher gains associated with scrapping activity 
rail s european rail operations have improved during the course of the year 
utilization rates remain high and operations have been positively impacted by success in new markets and the placement of new car deliveries 
asset remarketing income in included residual sharing fees from a managed portfolio  other residual sharing fees and a gain on the sale of railcars 
the largest component of remarketing income in was the gain on the sale of cars to canadian national railways 
asset remarketing income in included the gain on disposition of a leveraged lease commitment on passenger rail equipment 
other income of million increased million from due primarily to higher scrapping gains as the price of steel increased significantly from share of affiliates earnings of million were higher than the prior year 
the increase was the result of significant asset remarketing gains at domestic and foreign affiliates 
ownership costs ownership costs were million in compared to million in the increase was driven by significant investment volume in through new car and secondary market acquisitions  rail purchased approximately  railcars and  railcars in north america and europe  respectively 
other costs and expenses maintenance expense of million in increased million from maintenance costs increased sharply for a variety of reasons  including costs associated with moving cars from one customer to another  moving cars from idle to active service and continuing regulatory compliance 
as railcars move from idle to active service  repairs and improvements  such as replacement of tank car linings and valves  are often required 
although fewer cars were repaired  the cost per car increased due to the nature of the repairs 
during  the american association of railroads aar issued an early warning letter that required all owners of railcars in the united states  canada and mexico to inspect or replace certain bolsters manufactured from the mid s to by a now bankrupt supplier 
rail owned approximately  railcars equipped with bolsters that were required to be inspected or replaced 
approximately  of rail s affected railcars are on full service leases in which case rail is responsible for the costs of inspection or replacement 
as of december   bolsters on  cars have been replaced 
the cost attributable to the inspection and replacement of bolsters was million in  a decrease of 
million from the prior year period 
management expects the remaining costs of bolster replacements to be approximately 
million and to be completed by the end of the first quarter of other operating expenses were comparable between periods 
potential railcar regulatory mandates as noted previously  rail s operations as well as the entire railroad industry face the increasing possibility that additional security or safety regulations may be mandated  increasing future maintenance costs 
following are two such matters that the company is closely monitoring 
certain recent railroad derailments  some of which involved gatx railcars  focused attention on safety issues associated with the transportation of hazardous materials 
these incidents have led to calls for increased legislation and regulation to address safety and security issues associated with the transportation of hazardous materials 
suggested remedial measures vary  but include rerouting hazardous material railcar movements and increasing the inspection authority of the federal railroad administration fra 
other suggested remedial measures address the physical condition of tank cars  including revising manufacturing specifications for high pressure cars which carry hazardous materials 
specific focus has been directed at pressurized railcars built prior to that utilized non normalized steel 
the national transportation safety board ntsb issued a report in recommending that the fra conduct a comprehensive analysis to determine the impact resistance of pressurized tank cars built prior to  and use the results of that analysis to rank cars according to risk and to implement measures to eliminate or mitigate such risks 
the ntsb has not recommended that pressure cars built prior to be removed from service  nor has the fra issued any orders curtailing use of these cars 
the company owns approximately  pre built pressurized tank cars in north america of its north american fleet 
while the company is actively working with trade associations and others to participate in the legislative and regulatory process affecting rail transportation of hazardous materials  the outcome of proposed remedial measures  the probability of adoption of such measures  and the resulting impact on gatx should such measures be adopted cannot be determined at this time 
additionally  the association of american railroads aar has issued a proposal which would require all tank cars to be equipped with long travel constant contact side bearings lt ccsbs 
the application of lt ccsbs is intended to reduce empty tank car derailments by the reduction of train track operational issues 
management believes it is highly likely that the aar will adopt the lt ccsb rule essentially as written 
if it does so  this will affect certain tank cars throughout the industry and the company will be required to retrofit approximately  of its tank cars over the next to years at a cost of to per car 
the company generally has the contractual right to increase lease rates to recover a portion of the costs of this retrofit  and is currently formulating its plans on how it will exercise this contractual right

comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  summary rail s net income of million in increased million from the prior year 
income before the cumulative effect of accounting change decreased million 
the decrease was primarily due to lower north american lease income driven by lower average lease rates 
challenging market conditions in the north american rail industry affected rail in the oversupply of certain car types in the railcar market  short backlogs at railcar manufacturers  a weak economic environment and aggressive competition from other lessors resulted in lease rates that were below peak lease rates of the late s 
as a result  new market rates for expiring leases  either with the same customer or contracting with a new customer  were lower on average than the previous rate 
in  average lease rates on a basket of common car types declined versus the expiring rates 
with approximately  cars having expiring leases during  lower rates negatively impacted rail s lease income 
in anticipation of an improving economy  rail continued to purchase new cars and actively pursue secondary market transactions 
investment in railcars for north america increased in over the prior year  resulting in active cars increasing by approximately  cars after two consecutive years of decline 
the acquisition at the end of the fourth quarter of a fleet of  covered hoppers on long term lease drove the increase in active cars 
in addition  rail took delivery of approximately  new cars in  under pre existing purchase agreements with manufacturers 
utilization of the north american fleet improved from to due to aggressive efforts to improve the renewal success rate  to market specific car types and to scrap older  uneconomic cars from the fleet 
maintenance costs increased in from the level 
an increase in the number of car assignments and costs associated with an american association of railroads aar requirement to replace bolsters on certain cars see discussion below adversely impacted maintenance costs 
in  rail s european operations generally experienced a more favorable market environment than north america 
fleet utilization at both kvg and aae  rail s european joint venture  was over  as kvg s primary markets of chemical  petroleum  mineral and liquid petroleum gas remained stable  and aae benefited from the high growth rates of shipping activity at european seaports 
rail acquired the remaining interest in kvg in december dec s performance has been negatively affected by a weak polish economy 
however  kvg was successful in placing dec tank cars in service outside of poland 
this activity between kvg and dec marked the early stages of integrating their tank car operations  a key european strategy for rail 
gross income rail s gross income of million was million higher than excluding the impact from the timing of the kvg acquisition in both periods  gross income was down million from the decrease was primarily driven by lower north american lease income resulting from lower average lease rates and fewer railcars on lease for most of the year 
although average renewal rates continued to be lower than rail s prior contractual rate  the percentage decline in renewal rates improved during excluding kvg s pre tax earnings of million in  share of affiliates earnings in increased million 
the increase was the result of a favorable maintenance expense at domestic affiliates combined with a larger fleet and favorable foreign exchange rates at a foreign affiliate 
ownership costs ownership costs were million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to the acquisition and consolidation of kvg 
other costs and expenses maintenance expense of million in increased million from excluding kvg  maintenance expense increased million in the variance was due primarily to the increase in car assignments discussed above 
both and results included comparable levels of maintenance costs for certain railroad mandated repairs 
in  the aar issued a series of early warning letters that required all owners of railcars in the us  canada and mexico to inspect or replace certain bolsters manufactured from the mid s to by a now bankrupt supplier 
rail owned approximately  railcars equipped with bolsters that were required to be inspected or replaced 
due dates for inspection or replacement of the bolsters ranged from september  to december  depending on car type and service 
as of december   bolsters on approximately  cars had been replaced 
maintenance expense included million attributable to the inspection and replacement of bolsters 
in the second quarter of  the federal railroad administration issued a railworthiness directive bar car directive which required rail to inspect and repair  if necessary  a certain class of its cars that were built or modified with reinforcing bars prior to approximately  of rail s owned railcars were affected by the bar car directive 
the unfavorable impact on rail s operating results for was approximately million after tax  including lost revenue  inspection  cleaning and replacement car costs  which were partially offset by gains on the accelerated scrapping of affected cars 
as of year end  substantially all of the subject tank cars were removed from rail s fleet 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses of million increased million in excluding kvg  sg a expenses decreased million due to cost savings initiatives 
in  rail recorded a reversal of provision for possible losses of million resulting from improvement in portfolio quality  recoveries of bad debts  and more favorable aging of rail s receivables

cumulative effect of accounting change in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  rail completed a review of all recorded goodwill in fair values were established using discounted cash flows 
based on this review  rail recorded a one time  non cash impairment charge of million related to dec in the charge is non operational in nature and was recognized as a cumulative effect of accounting change as of january  in the consolidated statements of income 
the impairment charge was due primarily to lessened expectations of projected cash flows based on market conditions at the time of the review and a lower long term growth rate projected for dec 
gatx air worldwide revenue passenger miles increased in and lease rates are recovering from the low levels of recent years  in particular for newer aircraft 
however  the recovery is fragile  and is threatened by the high cost of jet fuel  as well as the possibility that additional airline failures and terrorist acts will disrupt global travel 
these challenging conditions persist  particularly in north america  where the combination of high fuel prices and pricing pressure from low cost carriers have increased operating losses and highlighted the vulnerabilities of many major us carriers 
some european airlines are also showing signs of weakness 
air s owned portfolio  which consists principally of narrowbody aircraft  had a weighted average age of five years based on the net book value at the end of air achieved almost full utilization in at december   less than of air s portfolio was available for lease with over on lease with customers  and the remaining was subject to signed letters of intent to lease with customers 
air successfully placed owned aircraft during  including new and existing aircraft 
lessee defaults and the potential impairment of aircraft values will continue to create potential uncertainties and volatility for air s earnings 
for example  boeing announced the cancellation of its b program in january  because of weak demand 
air holds a interest in pembroke group net book value of million  an aircraft lessor and manager based in ireland  which has boeing aircraft in its portfolio  six of which gatx has an interest in  all of which were on lease at december  additionally  air has one b aircraft on lease to ata  a bankrupt us carrier 
the future marketability of these aircraft and or potential valuation issues is uncertain at this time 
air s wholly owned and partnered aircraft are leased to customers under net operating leases 
air s other recurring source of revenue is fee income  which results from remarketing and administering aircraft in its joint ventures  as well as managing aircraft for third parties 
air s level of fee income can be unpredictable  varying with the performance of the managed fleet and air s success in remarketing and selling aircraft 
air also has investments in two partnerships with rolls royce plc pembroke group and rolls royce partners finance limited 
rolls royce partners finance limited  which leases aircraft engines  was a major contributor to air s financial performance in during  air took delivery of and placed three new a aircraft with non us airlines and also purchased four aircraft in the secondary market subject to existing leases  with the intent of partnering these aircraft in air has two additional aircraft purchase commitments in  and expects to retain the purchased aircraft as wholly owned aircraft

the impact of higher variable rents due to the increase in interest rates was million 
the increase was offset by early lease terminations and lower lease rates on certain renewed lease contracts 
asset remarketing income increased as the result of gains from the sale of four aircraft in the decrease in other income was primarily attributable to the recognition in of previously collected maintenance deposits on aircraft held for pending sale subsequently sold in

allowance for possible losses the purpose of the allowance is to provide an estimate of credit losses inherent in the investment portfolio for which reserving is appropriate 
in addition to establishing loss estimates for known troubled investments  this estimate involves consideration of historical loss experience  judgments about the impact of present economic conditions  collateral values  and the state of the markets in which gatx operates 
this overall allowance for possible losses is measured and reported as a percentage of total reservable assets 
reservable assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap include loans  direct finance leases  leveraged leases and receivables

gatx believes that the allowance is adequate to cover losses inherent in the reservable portfolio as of december  the allowance is based on judgments and estimates  which could change in the future  causing a corresponding change in the recorded allowance 
the allowance for possible losses of million decreased million from and represented of reservable assets  compared to in the prior year 
the allowance for possible losses as a percentage of reservable assets in reflects the general improvement in the credit quality of gatx s portfolio as well as the better than expected performance and run off of venture finance assets  which were reserved at a relatively higher rate than the rest of the portfolio

non performing investments finance leases and loans that are days or more past due  or where reasonable doubt exists as to timely collection of payments related thereto  are generally classified as non performing 
non performing assets also include the full net book value of operating lease assets deemed non performing which are subject to the impairment rules of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets as they are not considered reservable assets 
the allowance for possible losses  discussed above  relates only to rent and other receivables  finance leases and loans 
non performing investments do not include operating lease assets that are off lease or held for sale  investments within joint ventures or off balance sheet assets 
finance lease or interest income accrued but not collected is reversed when a lease or loan is classified as non performing 
payments received on non performing finance leases and loans for which the ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are applied as principal reductions 
otherwise  such collections are credited to income when received 
the following summarizes non performing assets by segment in millions december rail air specialty non performing investments at december  were million  million lower than the prior year amount of million 
the decrease in non performing leases and loans was driven by improvement in the air and specialty portfolios 
the rail increase was primarily due to operating lease assets with a net book value of million on lease to a bankrupt customer  for which restructured lease terms are currently being negotiated 
operating lease assets  facilities and other net operating lease assets and facilities increased million from primarily due to rail and air investments 
during  rail and air net operating lease assets and facilities increased million and million  respectively

air made final delivery payments on three new aircraft and acquired four used aircraft during progress payments gatx classifies amounts deposited toward the construction of wholly owned aircraft and other equipment  including capitalized interest  as progress payments 
progress payments made for aircraft owned by joint ventures in which gatx participates are classified as investments in affiliated companies 
progress payments were million at year end compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease is due to the reclassification of progress payments to operating lease assets for three aircraft delivered in investments in affiliated companies investments in affiliated companies decreased million in due to affiliate cash distributions exceeding affiliate income and the acquisition and consolidation of a joint venture 
gatx invested million in joint ventures in  compared to million in share of affiliates earnings were million and million in and  respectively

the billion of off balance sheet debt represents the present value of gatx s committed future operating lease payments at a discount rate 
debt total debt decreased million from primarily due to debt repayments of unsecured notes and bank loans  as well as decreased capital lease obligations

portfolio investments and capital additions portfolio investments and capital additions of million increased million from the following table presents portfolio investments and capital additions by segment in millions december rail air specialty other rail invested million in  an increase of million from the prior year 
the increase was primarily attributable to new railcar purchases  fleet acquisition activity and the purchase of the remaining interest in locomotive leasing partners  llc 
portfolio investments and capital additions at air of million were comparable to the prior year 
investments at specialty were significantly lower in as a result of curtailment in specialty investments 
future portfolio investments and capital additions excluding contractual commitments will depend on market conditions and opportunities to acquire desirable assets 
portfolio proceeds portfolio proceeds of million decreased million from the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in loan payments received  lower proceeds from disposal of lease equipment and cash distributions from joint venture investments partially offset by an increase in finance lease payments received and proceeds from sales of securities 
proceeds from other asset sales proceeds from other asset sales of million in primarily relate to million proceeds received from the sale of staten island property in addition to proceeds from railcar scrappings

gatx utilizes both the domestic and international bank and capital markets 
gatx believes its current liquidity remains strong due to its cash position  available and committed credit lines and more cost effective access to the capital markets relative to recent years 
credit facilities on may  gatx s wholly owned subsidiary gatx financial corporation gfc  entered into a credit agreement for million comprised of a three year senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in may  and a million five year senior unsecured term loan  with a delayed draw feature effective for one year  maturing in may the new agreement replaces the three separate revolving credit facilities previously in place at gfc 
at december   availability under the credit facility was million with million of letters of credit issued and backed by the facility  million drawn on the facility and million of commercial paper issued 
all million of the unsecured term loan was available 
restrictive covenants the revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan contain various restrictive covenants  including requirements to maintain a defined net worth and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
in addition  both contain certain negative pledge provisions  including an asset coverage test  and a limitation on liens condition for borrowings on the facility and the term loan 
as defined in the credit facility and term loan  the net worth of gfc at december  was billion  which was in excess of the minimum net worth requirement of billion 
additionally  the ratio of earnings to fixed charges as defined in the credit facility and term loan was x for the period ended december   in excess of the minimum covenant ratio of x 
at december   gfc was in compliance with the covenants and conditions of the credit facility 
the indentures for gfc s public debt also contain restrictive covenants  including limitations on loans  advances or investments in related parties including gatx and dividends it may distribute to gatx 
some of the indentures also contain limitation on lien provisions that limit the amount of secured indebtedness that gfc may incur  subject to several exceptions  including those permitting an unlimited amount of purchase money indebtedness and nonrecourse indebtedness 
in addition to the other specified exceptions  gfc would be able to incur liens securing a maximum of million of additional indebtedness as of december  based on the most restrictive limitation on liens provision 
at december   gfc was in compliance with the covenants and conditions of the indentures 
the covenants in the credit facilities and indentures effectively limit the ability of gfc to transfer funds to gatx in the form of loans  advances or dividends 
at december   the maximum amount that gfc could transfer to gatx without violating its financial covenants was million  implying that million of subsidiary net assets were restricted 
restricted assets are defined as the subsidiary s equity  less intercompany receivables from the parent company  less the amount that could be transferred to the parent company 
in addition to the credit facility and indentures  gfc and its subsidiaries are subject to financial covenants related to certain bank financings 
some bank financings include coverage and net worth financial covenants as well as negative pledges 
one financing contains a leverage covenant  while another financing contains leverage and cash flow covenants that are specific to a subsidiary 
gfc does not anticipate any covenant violation in the credit facility  bank financings  or indenture  nor does gfc anticipate that any of these covenants will restrict its operations or its ability to procure additional financing 
debt financing secured financings are comprised of the sale leaseback of railcars  loans secured by railcars and aircraft  and a commercial paper conduit securitization facility 
the railcar sale leasebacks qualify as operating leases and the assets or liabilities associated with this equipment are not recorded on the balance sheet 
in december  the commercial paper conduit securitization facility was renewed as a million facility 
in june  gfc completed a debt exchange transaction for portions of three series of notes due in old notes for a new series of notes due in new notes 
the old notes are comprised of the notes due march   the notes due december   and the notes due december  a total of million of old notes were tendered in the transaction 
as part of the exchange  a premium to par value of million was paid to noteholders that participated in the transaction 
the premium included an amount reflecting the current market value of the notes above par at the date of exchange plus an inducement fee for entering into the exchange 
during  all of gatx s debt issuance was at gfc 
gfc issued a total of million and repaid million of long term debt 
significant financings in included million of aircraft financing guaranteed by the european export credit agencies 
as of december   million of senior unsecured notes had been issued against the shelf registration of billion 
gfc also has debt in the form of commercial paper and bank revolver drawings 
these sources of cash are typically used to fund daily operations  and accumulate until they are paid down using cash flow or proceeds of long term debt issuance 
credit ratings the availability of gatx s funding options may be adversely affected by certain factors including the global capital market environment and outlook as well as gfc s financial performance and outlook 
access to capital markets at competitive rates is dependent on gfc s credit rating as determined by rating agencies such as standard poor s s p and moody s investor service moody s 
on december   s p affirmed the credit rating on gfc s long term unsecured debt at bbb  and revised the rating outlook to positive from stable 
on may   moody s affirmed the credit rating on gfc s long term unsecured debt at baa  and revised the rating outlook to stable from negative 
gfc s existing commercial paper credit ratings of a s p and p moody s restricts gfc s access to the commercial paper market 
however  subsequent to december   gfc has had over million of commercial paper outstanding at times 
one of the factors that the rating agencies monitor in reviewing gfc s credit rating is its use of secured debt 
in particular  s p monitors the ratio of gfc s secured assets as a percentage of total assets 
over the last four years  this ratio has increased substantially as gfc has financed new aircraft deliveries with secured debt supported by the european export credit agencies and the us export import bank 
gatx currently believes that its secured asset ratio can be maintained at levels acceptable to the rating agencies 
however  if gfc became unable to access unsecured financing in the future  it may have to rely on secured financing and could suffer a credit rating downgrade if the resulting increase in its secured asset ratio became unacceptable to one or both rating agencies 
liquidity position gfc expects that it will be able to meet its contractual obligations for through a combination of projected cash flow from operations  portfolio proceeds  committed unsecured term loan  and its revolving credit facilities 
contractual commitments at december   gatx s contractual commitments  including debt maturities  lease payments  and unconditional purchase obligations were in millions payments due by period total thereafter debt  commercial paper and credit facilities capital lease obligations operating leases recourse  operating leases nonrecourse unconditional purchase obligations other the carrying value of recourse and nonrecourse debt debt is adjusted for fair value hedges 
as of december   debt of  million excludes a fair value adjustment of million 
the adjustment for qualifying fair value hedges is excluded from the above table as such amount does not represent a contractual commitment with a fixed amount or maturity date 
other represents gatx s obligation under the terms of the dec acquisition agreement to cause dec to make qualified investments of million by december  to the extent there are no satisfactory investment opportunities during  dec may invest in long term securities for purposes of future investment 
unconditional purchase obligations at december   gatx s unconditional purchase obligations of million consisted primarily of commitments to purchase railcars and scheduled aircraft acquisitions 
gatx had commitments of million related to the committed railcar purchase program entered into in gatx also had commitments of million for orders on two new aircraft to be delivered in additional unconditional purchase obligations include million of other rail related commitments 
at december   gatx s unconditional purchase obligations by segment were in millions payments due by period total thereafter rail air specialty 
guarantees in connection with certain investments or transactions  gatx has entered into various commercial commitments  such as guarantees and standby letters of credit  which could require performance in the event of demands by third parties 
similar to gatx s balance sheet investments  these guarantees expose gatx to credit  market and equipment risk  accordingly  gatx evaluates its commitments and other contingent obligations using techniques similar to those used to evaluate funded transactions 
lease and loan payment guarantees generally involve guaranteeing repayment of the financing utilized to acquire assets being leased by an affiliate to customers  and are in lieu of making direct equity investments in the affiliate 
gatx is not aware of any event of default which would require it to satisfy these guarantees  and expects the affiliates to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy their lease and loan obligations 
asset residual value guarantees represent gatx s commitment to third parties that an asset or group of assets will be worth a specified amount at the end of a lease term 
approximately of the company s asset residual value guarantees are related to rail equipment 
based on known facts and current market conditions  management does not believe that the asset residual value guarantees will result in any negative financial impact to gatx 
gatx believes these asset residual value guarantees will likely generate future income in the form of fees and residual sharing proceeds 
gatx and its subsidiaries are also parties to standing letters of credit and bonds primarily related to workers compensation and general liability insurance coverages 
no material claims have been made against these obligations 
at december   gatx does not expect any material losses to result from these off balance sheet instruments because performance is not anticipated to be required 
gatx s commercial commitments at december  were in millions amount of commitment expiration per period total thereafter affiliate debt guarantees recourse to gatx 
asset residual value guarantees lease and loan payment guarantees guarantees standby letters of credit and bonds pension contributions in  gatx contributed million to its funded and unfunded pension plans 
in  the company expects to make payments of approximately million with respect to its pension plans 
additional contributions will be dependent on a number of factors including plan asset investment returns and actuarial experience 
subject to the impact of these factors  the company may make additional material plan contributions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
the company regularly evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and other relevant factors and circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company considers the following as critical accounting policies operating lease assets and facilities operating lease assets and facilities are stated principally at cost 
assets acquired under capital leases are included in operating lease assets and the related obligations are recorded as liabilities 
provisions for depreciation include the amortization of the cost of capital leases 
certain operating lease assets and facilities are depreciated using the straight line method to an estimated residual value 
railcars  locomotives  aircraft  marine vessels  buildings and leasehold improvements are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the company periodically reviews the appropriateness of depreciable lives and residual values based on physical and economic factors  as well as existing market conditions 
impairment of long lived assets a review for impairment of long lived assets  such as operating lease assets and facilities  is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
estimated future cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including lease rates  lease term  operating costs  life of the asset and disposition proceeds 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds fair value 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
in addition  the company periodically reviews the residual values used in the accounting for finance leases 
when conditions indicate the residual value has declined  the company recognizes the accounting impact in that period 
allowance for possible losses the purpose of the allowance is to provide an estimate of credit losses with respect to reservable assets inherent in the investment portfolio 
reservable assets include gross receivables  loans and finance leases 
gatx s estimate of the amount of provision reversal for losses incurred in each period requires consideration of historical loss experience  judgments about the impact of present economic conditions  collateral values  and the state of the markets in which gatx participates  in addition to specific losses for known troubled accounts 
gatx charges off amounts that management considers unrecoverable from obligors or the disposition of collateral 
gatx assesses the recoverability of investments by considering several factors  including customer payment history and financial position 
the allowance for possible losses is regularly reviewed for adequacy considering changes in economic conditions  collateral values  credit quality indicators and customer specific circumstances 
gatx believes that the allowance is adequate to cover losses inherent in the portfolio as of december  because the allowance is based on judgments and estimates  it is possible that those judgments and estimates could change in the future  causing a corresponding change in the recorded allowance 
investments in affiliated companies investments in affiliated companies represent investments in domestic and foreign companies and joint ventures that are in businesses similar to those of gatx  such as commercial aircraft leasing  rail equipment leasing  and other business activities  including ventures that provide asset residual value guarantees in both domestic and foreign markets 
investments in to percent owned companies and joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method and are shown as investments in affiliated companies 
certain investments in joint ventures that exceed ownership are not consolidated and are also accounted for using the equity method when gatx does not have effective or voting control of these legal entities and is not the primary beneficiary of the venture s activities 
the investments in affiliated companies are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted for gatx s share of the affiliate s undistributed earnings 
distributions  which reflect both dividends and the return of principal  reduce the carrying amount of the investment 
pension and post retirement benefits assumptions gatx s pension and post retirement benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial assumptions 
two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets  are important elements of plan expense and liability measurement 
gatx evaluates these critical assumptions annually 
other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement  mortality  turnover and rate of compensation increases 
the discount rate is used to calculate the present value of expected future pension and post retirement cash flows as of the measurement date 
the guideline for establishing this rate is high quality  long term bond rates 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
a lower than expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these assumptions 
income taxes gatx evaluates the need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance by assessing the likelihood of whether deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforward benefits  will be realized in the future 
the assessment of whether a valuation allowance is required involves judgment including the forecast of future taxable income and the evaluation of tax planning initiatives  if applicable 
taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as the company has historically maintained that undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and affiliates were intended to be permanently reinvested in those foreign operations 
if in the future  these earnings are repatriated to the us  or if the company expects such earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future  provision for additional taxes would be required 
the american jobs creation act of introduced a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer repatriation provision provided certain criteria are met 
the repatriation provision is available to gatx for the year ended december  gatx is currently evaluating the effect of the repatriation provision on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings 
the range of reasonably possible amounts of unremitted earnings considered for repatriation  and the income tax effects of such repatriation cannot be estimated with certainty at this time 
it is anticipated that the evaluation of the effect of the repatriation provision will be completed during the third quarter of gatx s operations are subject to taxes in the us  various states and foreign countries and as result  may be subject to audit in all of these jurisdictions 
tax audits may involve complex issues and disagreements with taxing authorities could require several years to resolve 
accruals for tax contingencies require management to make estimates and assessments with respect to the ultimate outcome of tax audit issues 
new accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of new accounting pronouncements that may impact gatx s business 
non gaap financial measures non gaap financial measures disclosed in this report are meant to provide additional information and insight to historical operating results and financial position of the business 
management uses these performance measures to assist in analyzing the company s underlying financial performance from period to period  evaluate the financial performance of its operating segments  and establish criteria for compensation decisions 
the company presented return on assets  including off balance sheet assets  because it believes that incorporating off balance sheet assets  primarily rail cars financed with operating leases  results in a more accurate measure of the return gatx receives on assets in which it has an ownership like interest 
the sg a efficiency ratio as presented  which includes sg a expenses before the capitalization of initial direct costs  is a more accurate measurement of actual sg a incurred for the year as it relates to underlying owned and managed assets 
utilizing the total owned and managed asset base is more reflective of the support services and administrative activities performed for both gatx and its customers 
these measures are not in accordance with  or a substitute for  gaap and may be different from or inconsistent with non gaap financial measures used by other companies 
glossary of key terms initial direct costs sg a expenses incurred by gatx to originate new loans and leases 
identified initial direct costs are deferred and amortized over the term of the lease or loan 
managed assets assets that gatx manages  but that are not included in assets on balance sheet or off balance sheet assets 
an asset is considered managed if gatx performs the same activities relative to the asset as performed for similar owned assets 
the managed assets include the assets wholly owned by third parties and assets owned by joint ventures in which gatx is both an investor and manager 
in these cases  managed assets are shown net of gatx s investment in the joint venture  to the extent the investment is already included in on balance sheet or off balance sheet assets 
non gaap financial measures numerical measure of a company s historical performance  financial position or liquidity that is different from that presented in the financial statements as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
off balance sheet assets assets  primarily railcars  which are financed with operating leases and therefore not recorded on the balance sheet 
gatx estimates the off balance sheet asset amount by calculating the present value of committed future operating lease payments using a discount rate 
on balance sheet assets total assets as reported on the balance sheet excluding assets of discontinued operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  gatx is exposed to interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate  and equity price risks that could impact results of operations 
to manage these risks  gatx  pursuant to authorized policies  may enter into certain derivative transactions  principally interest rate swaps  treasury note derivatives and currency swaps 
these instruments and other derivatives are entered into for hedging purposes only to manage existing underlying exposures 
gatx does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate exposure gatx s interest expense is affected by changes in interest rates as a result of its use of variable rate debt instruments 
based on gatx s variable rate debt instruments at december  and giving affect to related derivatives  if market rates were to increase hypothetically by basis points  after tax interest expense would increase by approximately million in functional currency reporting currency exchange rate exposure gatx conducts operations in foreign countries  principally europe and canada 
as a result  changes in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies would affect gatx s reported earnings 
based on reported earnings from continuing operations  a uniform and hypothetical strengthening in the us dollar versus applicable foreign currencies would decrease after tax income from continuing operations in by approximately million 
the interpretation and analysis of the results from the hypothetical changes to interest rates and currency exchange rates should not be considered in isolation  such changes would typically have corresponding offsetting effects 
for example  offsetting effects are present to the extent that floating rate debt is associated with floating rate assets 
equity price exposure gatx also has equity price risk inherent in stock and warrants of companies in which it has investments 
at december   the fair value of the stock and warrants was million and million  respectively 
the hypothetical change in value from a sensitivity test would not be material to gatx operations
