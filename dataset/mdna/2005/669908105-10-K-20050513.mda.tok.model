ltd nia are engaged in the distribution of high technology active and passive electronic components to a wide variety of original equipment manufacturers oems of electronic products 
active components distributed by the company include semiconductor products such as memory chips  microprocessors  digital and linear circuits  microwave  rf and fiber optic components  transistors and diodes 
passive components distributed by nic  principally to oems and other distributors nationally  consist of a high technology line of chip and leaded components  including capacitors  resistors and related networks 
the electronics and the electronics distribution industries suffered one of the most severe downturns in the industries history beginning in and continuing through most of this downturn was marked by an oversupply of components  excess manufacturing capacity and a significant decline in the demand for electronic components 
the second half of calendar was a break out period for the industry 
this was evidenced by industry wide double digit sequential and year over year increases in sales dollar volume for both calendar and  albeit accompanied by continued downward margin pressures 
management believes that this improvement in the components market worldwide should continue 
the company s strategy of maintaining its infrastructure and investing during the electronic industry s severe downturn is now beginning to see positive results 
sales in asia increased approximately from fiscal to fiscal and the company s book to bill ratio  company wide  remains positive 
year over year and quarter over quarter the company has increased market share with all of its major suppliers for both the semiconductor and passive component businesses 
for the fiscal year ended february   net sales increased to million from million in the comparable period last year 
net income for fiscal was  or

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes and contingencies and litigation  on an ongoing basis 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
under sab  revenue is recognized when the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes revenues at time of shipment of its products and sales are recorded net of discounts and returns 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated bad debts 
our estimate of the allowances needed is based on our past history of collections of accounts receivable from our customers 
this history has shown that we have always provided sufficient allowances in prior periods 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their inability to make payments  additional allowances might be required thereby reducing our operating income 
for example  each additional of accounts receivable requiring an allowance would have reduced operating income by approximately  for the year ended february  inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market 
write downs of inventories to market value are based upon product franchise agreements governing price protection  stock rotation and obsolescence  as well as assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
in prior periods  reserves required for obsolescence were not material to our financial statements 
if assumptions about future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs of inventories could be required 
for example  each additional of inventory that became obsolete and could not be returned under our many distributor franchise agreements  would have reduced operating income by approximately  for the year ended february  fiscal year versus results of operations net sales for the year ended february  aggregated  as compared to  for the year ended february   an increase of approximately  or 
given the historically cyclical nature of the company s industry  management attributes this increase in sales performance in the latter part of fiscal calendar as the break out period the electronic components industry had long been expecting 
the substantial year over year sales gains can be attributed to the recovery experienced by the semiconductor industry in general over the last twelve months as well as a significant increase in our asian sales in  an increase of approximately comparing fiscal to the prior year 
management believes  however  that the industry growth rate in the near term will be in the single digits 
the marketplace continues to offer poor near term visibility  which makes it difficult for management to estimate the company s overall sales volume and earnings prospects for the fiscal year 
page 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued fiscal year versus continued results of operations continued gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended february  as compared to for the year ended february  management believes that this continuing gross margin pressure results from a change in the company s product mix and increased order size coupled with increased sales in the asian market  which requires lower selling prices due to volume demand from large asian contract manufacturers 
management believes that margin pressures may continue during the first half of fiscal and possibly stabilize in the second half of the year  however  no assurances can be given in this regard 
operating expenses increased to  for the year ended february  from  for the year ended february   an increase of approximately  or 
the dollar increase in operating expenses was due to increases in the following expense categories approximately  or of the increase was for personnel related costs resulting from increased staffing levels in connection with the expansion of the company s asian and us operational capability during the current fiscal year 
the remaining increases were a result of net increases in bank fees and charges  or  insurances and professional fees  or  sarbanes oxley compliance  or  rent  or  bad debt reserves  or  freight  or and miscellaneous other expenses  or 
management made a strategic decision to invest in expanding the company s personnel during the recent market downturn  which resulted in increased operating expenses 
management believes that this investment will enable the company to take advantage of the current and future rebound the industry is currently experiencing  although no assurances can be given in this regard 
interest expense increased to  for the year ended february  as compared to  for the year ended february  this increase was primarily due to a return to bank borrowings beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to the increase in the company s inventory and accounts receivable levels which were needed to support increased sales activity in the latter half of the fiscal period and a thirty five percent sales increase for fiscal net income from for the year ended february  was  or 
per share  as compared to a loss of  or 
per share for the year ended february  management attributes the fiscal profit of  to the increase in gross margin dollars exceeding the increase in operating and interest expense 
fiscal year versus results of operations net sales for the year ended february  aggregated  as compared to  for the year ended february   an increase of approximately  or 
this increase was comprised of a decline in sales of approximately  in the first six months of the fiscal year as compared to the first six months of the prior fiscal year 
this was followed by an increase in sales of approximately  in the second half of fiscal as compared to the last six months of fiscal gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended february  as compared to for the year ended february  management believes that this gross margin pressure resulted from a change in the company s product mix which was impacted by larger orders in the computer and liquid crystal categories domestically  coupled with increased sales in the asian market which required lower selling prices due to volume demand from asian contract manufacturer 
operating expenses increased to  for the year ended february  from  for the year ended february   an increase of approximately  or 
the dollar increase in operating expenses was entirely due to personnel related costs commissions  salaries  travel and fringe benefits resulting from increased staffing levels in connection with the expansion of the company s asian and us operational capability during the fiscal year 
management made a strategic decision to invest in expanding the company s personnel during the market downturn  which resulted in increased operating expenses

liquidity and capital resources fiscal year versus the company ended its fiscal year with working capital and cash aggregating approximately  and  respectively  as compared to approximately  and  respectively  at february  the company s current ratio at february   was as compared to at february  on september   the company entered into a secured revolving line of credit  as amended  with eight banks  which currently provides for maximum borrowings of  or maximum borrowings of  utilizing an asset based formula predicated on a certain percentage of outstanding domestic accounts receivable and inventory positions at any given month end 
the credit line bears interest at either i the lead bank s prime rate or ii libor plus to basis points depending on the ratio of the company s liabilities to its tangible net worth  at the option of the company through february  borrowings under this line of credit were  at february  and  at february  as of the end of both fiscal years  the company was in compliance with all the required bank covenants 
the company anticipates that its resources provided by its cash flow from operations and its current borrowing agreement  will be sufficient to meet its financing requirements for the next twelve month period

however  inflation and changing interest rates have had a significant effect on the economy in general and therefore could affect the operating results of the company in the future 
forward looking statement disclaimer except for historical information contained herein  the matters set forth above may be forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are based on the current beliefs of the company s management 
certain risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those in the forward looking statements 
potential risks and uncertainties include such factors as those described under risk factors below 
the company does not undertake any obligation to update its forward looking statements 
risk factors a large portion of the company s revenues come from sales of semiconductors  which is a highly cyclical industry  and an industry down cycle could significantly affect the company s operating results 
the semiconductor industry historically has experienced periodic fluctuations in product supply and demand  often associated with changes in technology and manufacturing capacity  and is generally considered to be highly cyclical 
according to the semiconductor industry association  the semiconductor industry experienced its worst annual downturn in history with revenue from worldwide semiconductor sales estimated to have fallen by approximately from calendar to the company s revenues closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market 
the company s total sales of electronic components in fiscal years    and were     and  respectively 
although the company s results have recently shown signs of an industry upturn  a technology industry downcycle  particularly in the semiconductor sector  could negatively affect the company s operating results in the future 
page 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company s revenues and profitability have declined significantly from historical highs and  although revenues have started to increase in recent quarters  the company may be unable to achieve consistent profitability at levels experienced in the past 
the company s operations have been significantly and negatively affected by the recent downturn in the technology industry and the general economy 
from a high of approximately million in sales in the fiscal quarter ended november  the company s sales stabilized in the to million range per quarter for eight quarters 
in the last four quarters  the company s revenues have begun to show signs of stability with sequential revenues of    and  for the quarters ended february  the company has not yet been able to achieve consistent profitability at a level deemed acceptable to management 
as a result  the company has continued to implement substantial cost cutting measures designed to align its expenses to provide profitability at current revenue levels 
the success of these cost cutting measures  as well as the timing of any economic recovery  will affect the company s ability to achieve consistent profitability at reasonable levels 
although the company does not anticipate any restructuring charges in the near term  if the company is not able to maintain an acceptable level of profitability  the company may need to consider further expense reductions 
if the company were unable to maintain its relationships with key suppliers  it could adversely affect the company s sales 
in fiscal  sales of products and services from each of three suppliers exceeded of the company s inventory on a consolidated basis 
as a result  to the extent that those suppliers are not willing to do business with the company in the future on terms acceptable to the company  the loss of these suppliers could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
if any of these industry leading suppliers was unwilling to do business with the company  the company s relationships with its customers could be materially adversely affected because the company s customers depend on the company s distribution of electronic components and computer products from the industry s leading suppliers 
declines in the value of the company s inventory could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
the electronic components and computer products industry is subject to rapid technological change  new and enhanced products and evolving industry standards  which can contribute to decline in value or obsolescence of inventory 
during an economic downturn it is possible that prices will decline due to an oversupply of product and  therefore  there may be greater risk of declines in inventory value 
although it is the policy of many of the company s suppliers to offer distributors like the company certain protections from the loss in value of inventory such as price protection  limited rights of return and rebates  the company cannot assure you that such return policies and rebates will fully compensate it for the loss in value  or that the vendors will choose to  or be able to  honor such agreements 
the company cannot assure you that unforeseen new product developments or declines in the value of its inventory will not materially adversely affect its business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity  or that the company will successfully manage its existing and future inventories 
substantial defaults by the company s customers on the company s accounts receivable could have a significant negative impact on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
a significant portion of the company s working capital consists of accounts receivable from customers 
if customers responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay for products and services  or were to become unwilling or unable to make payments in a timely manner  the company s business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected 
if the economic and industry downturn were to continue  it could have an adverse affect on the servicing of these accounts receivable  which could result in longer payment cycles  increased collection costs and defaults in excess of management s expectations 
page 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the electronics component and computer industries are highly competitive and if the company cannot effectively compete  its revenues may decline 
the market for the company s products and services is very competitive and subject to rapid technological advances 
not only does the company compete with other distributors  it also competes for customers with some of its own suppliers 
the company s failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could adversely affect its business and prospects 
the sizes of the company s competitors vary across market sectors  as do the resources the company has allocated to the sectors in which it does business 
therefore  some of the competitors may have greater financial  personnel  capacity and other resources than the company has in one or more of its market sectors 
as a result  the company s competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to potential acquisitions and other market opportunities  new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
the company s non us locations represent a significant and growing portion of its revenue  and consequently  the company is increasingly exposed to risks associated with operating internationally 
in fiscal  approximately of the company s sales came from its operations outside the united states 
during fiscal  and approximately  and of sales  respectively  were from locations outside the united states 
most notable in this growth of non us sales is the increasing volume of sales activity in the asia region  which accounted for approximately of consolidated sales in fiscal as a result of the company s foreign sales and locations  its operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations  including the following potential restrictions on transfers of funds  foreign currency fluctuations  import and export duties and value added taxes  import and export regulation changes that could erode profit margins or restrict exports  changing foreign tax laws and regulations  potential military conflicts  inflexible employee contracts in the event of business downturns  and the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws 
manufacturing of electronic component and computer products is increasingly shifting to lower cost production facilities in asia  and most notably the people s republic of china 
the company s business and prospects could be materially adversely affected if this shift continues and the company is unable to develop distribution relationships with these or other manufacturers on acceptable terms 
in particular  if the company is unable to develop relationships with manufacturers that provide profit margins comparable to the margins maintained under existing relationships  the company s operating results may be negatively affected 
in addition  the company has operations in several locations in emerging or developing economies that have a potential for higher risk 
the risks associated with these economies include currency volatility and other economic or political risks 
while the company has and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the impact of losses resulting from volatile currencies and other risks of doing business abroad  the company cannot ensure that such measures will be adequate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk all of the company s bank debt and the associated interest expense are sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates 
the company s credit facility bears interest based on interest rates tied to the prime or libor rate  either of which may fluctuate over time based on economic conditions 
a hypothetical basis point one percentage point increase in interest rates would have resulted in incremental interest expense of approximately  for the year ended february  there were only nominal bank borrowings for the comparable prior year period ended february  as a result  the company is subject to market risk for changes in interest rates and could be subjected to increased or decreased interest payments if market rates fluctuate and the company is in a borrowing mode

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued foreign exchange rate risk the company has several foreign subsidiaries in asia  the united kingdom and canada 
the company does business in more than one dozen countries and currently generates approximately of its revenues from outside north america 
the company s ability to sell its products in foreign markets may be affected by changes in economic  political or market conditions in the foreign markets in which the company does business 
the company s total assets in its foreign subsidiaries was million and million at february  and respectively  translated into us dollars at the closing exchange rates 
the company also acquires certain inventory from foreign suppliers and  as such  faces risk due to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these risks could have a material impact on the company s results in future periods 
the potential loss based on end of period balances and prevailing exchange rates resulting from a hypothetical strengthening of the dollar against foreign currencies was not material in the quarter ended february  the company does not currently employ any currency derivative instruments  futures contracts or other currency hedging techniques to mitigate its risks in this regard 
industry risk the electronic component industry is cyclical which can cause significant fluctuations in sales  gross profit margins and profits  from year to year 
for example  during calendar  the industry experienced a severe decline in the demand for electronic components  which caused sales to decrease by 
the prior year reflected a increase in net sales 
it is difficult to predict the timing of the changing cycles in the electronic component industry
