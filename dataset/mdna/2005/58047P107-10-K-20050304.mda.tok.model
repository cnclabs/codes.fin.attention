table of contents asset quality asset quality is generally a function of economic conditions  our underwriting and ongoing management of our investment portfolio 
as a business development company  our loans and equity investments are carried at market value or  in the absence of market value  at fair value as determined by our board of directors in good faith on a quarterly basis 
as of december  and  net unrealized depreciation on investments totaled million and million  respectively 
for additional information on the decrease in unrealized depreciation on investments  see the section entitled net investment gains losses 
in addition to various risk management and monitoring tools  we also use an investment rating system to characterize and monitor our expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio 
we use the following to investment rating scale 
below is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating investment rating summary description capital gain expected or realized full return of principal and interest or dividend expected with customer performing in accordance with plan full return of principal and interest or dividend expected but customer requires closer monitoring some loss of interest or dividend expected but still expecting an overall positive internal rate of return on the investment loss of interest or dividend and some loss of principal investment expected which would result in an overall negative internal rate of return on the investment the following table shows the distribution of our investments on the to investment rating scale at fair value as of december  and dollars in millions december  december  investment rating investments at fair value percentage of total portfolio investments at fair value percentage of total portfolio a a a of this amount  million at december  and million at december  relates to debt instruments in companies for which we have already realized a gain through the sale of equity instruments 
while these debt instruments are still outstanding  all of the related equity instruments have already been sold at a gain and  therefore  we do not expect any further realized gain 
we monitor loan concentrations in our portfolio  both on an individual investment basis and on a sector or industry basis  to manage overall portfolio performance due to specific customer issues or specific industry issues 
the increase in investments with a rating is primarily due to origination activity during at december   of the investments with a rating  million were loans  all of which were on non accrual 
of the investments with a rating  million were loans  of which million were on non accrual 
at december   of the investments with a rating  million were loans  all of which were on non accrual 
of the investments with a rating  million were loans  of which million were on non accrual 
the increase in investments with a rating during is primarily due to the downgrade of one investment in the technology sector 

table of contents we monitor individual customer s financial trends in order to assess the appropriate course of action with respect to each customer and to evaluate overall portfolio quality 
we closely monitor the status and performance of each individual investment on a quarterly and  in some cases  a monthly or more frequent basis 
because we are a provider of long term privately negotiated investment capital to growth oriented companies and we actively manage our investments through our contract structure and corporate governance rights  we do not believe that contract exceptions such as breaches of contractual covenants or late delivery of financial statements are necessarily an indication of deterioration in the credit quality or the need to pursue remedies or an active workout of a portfolio investment 
when a loan becomes days or more past due  or if we otherwise do not expect the customer to be able to service its debt and other obligations  we will  as a general matter  place the loan on non accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that loan until all principal has been paid 
however  we may make exceptions to this policy if the investment is well secured and in the process of collection 
at december  and  there were million and million  respectively  of loans  or approximately and  respectively  of the investment portfolio  greater than days past due 
at december   million of loans  including all of the loans greater than days past due  were on non accrual status representing of the investment portfolio 
at december   million of loans  including million of the loans greater than days past due  were on non accrual status representing of the investment portfolio 
the non accrual and past due loans at december  and primarily represented borrowers in the publishing  telecommunications and paging businesses 
we believe this situation has arisen because portions of the trade publishing industry which are dependent on financial  technology or telecommunications advertising  experienced sluggish advertising revenue 
in addition  we believe certain companies in the telecommunications industry have suffered from competitive pressure from low cost and prepaid cellular calling plans 
at december   of the million of loans to our majority owned portfolio companies  million were on non accrual status 
at december   of the million of loans to our majority owned portfolio companies  million were on non accrual status 
at december   of the million of loans to our controlled non majority owned portfolio companies  none were on non accrual status 
at december   of the million of loans to our controlled non majority owned portfolio companies  million were on non accrual status 
as of december   of the million of loans to other affiliates  none were on non accrual status 
as of december   of the million of loans to other affiliates  million were on non accrual status 
when principal and interest on a loan is not paid within the applicable grace period  we will contact the customer for collection 
at that time  we will make a determination as to the extent of the problem  if any 
we will then pursue a commitment for immediate payment and if we have not already  we will begin to more actively monitor the investment 
we will formulate strategies to optimize the resolution process and will begin the process of restructuring the investment to better reflect the current financial performance of the customer 
such a restructuring may involve deferring payments of principal and interest  adjusting interest rates or warrant positions  imposing additional fees  amending financial or operating covenants or converting debt to equity 
in general  in order to compensate us for any enhanced risk  we receive additional compensation from the customer in connection with a restructuring 
during the process of monitoring a loan that is out of compliance  we will in appropriate circumstances send a notice of non compliance outlining the specific defaults that have occurred and preserving our remedies  and initiate a review of the collateral 
when a restructuring is not the most appropriate course of action  we may determine to pursue remedies available under our loan documents or at law to minimize any potential losses  including initiating foreclosure and or liquidation proceedings

the increase in dividend income was primarily related to dividends on preferred stock of one of our control investments  bridgecom holdings  inc during the year ended december   our bridgecom investment accounted for approximately of our total operating income 
we currently expect that our bridgecom investment will continue to comprise a significant component of our operating 
table of contents income  however  our ability to recognize this income will be dependent upon the performance of bridgecom 
the decrease in interest income on loans was due to a lower average spread to libor on the loan portfolio partially offset by asset growth and an increase in libor 
the lower spread to libor is partly due to a change in investment mix  which includes an increase in the proportion of our investment portfolio that is in diversified sectors 
these investments generally bear lower risk and yield lower interest rates  which accounted for approximately million of the change in spread 
we have originated these investments to enhance our diversification  to reduce overall portfolio risk and to achieve better execution on our debt financing 
further  because libor increased during the year ended december   the spread to libor on fixed rate loans and loans with libor floors decreased 
this accounted for approximately million of the change in spread

new advances under the credit facility are at the discretion of the lender 
the credit facility expires on september  and bears interest at libor plus or the prime rate plus 
the credit facility will be secured by a first priority security interest in our tangible and intangible assets subject to certain excluded collateral and certain permitted other liens 
the credit facility contains customary terms and conditions  including  without limitation  affirmative and negative covenants such as information reporting  minimum stockholders equity and a negative pledge 
the credit facility also contains customary events of default with customary cure and notice  including  without limitation  nonpayment misrepresentation in a material respect  breach of covenant  cross default to other indebtedness  bankruptcy  change of control  change of management and material adverse change 
as of december   we had million outstanding under the credit facility and in february  we increased the amount outstanding under this facility to million 
warehouse facility 
on january   our wholly owned  bankruptcy remote  special purpose indirect subsidiary  mcg commercial loan trust entered into a million secured warehouse credit facility with an affiliate of ubs ag 
we used the warehouse credit facility to fund our origination and purchase of a diverse pool of loans  including broadly syndicated rated loans  which we securitized using an affiliate of the lender as the exclusive structurer and underwriter or placement agent 
advances under the credit facility bore interest at libor plus 
the warehouse credit facility operated much like a revolving credit facility that is primarily secured by the loans acquired with the advances under the credit facility 
on september   we paid off the warehouse credit facility with the proceeds from the term securitization and terminated the facility 
term securitization 
on december   we established the mcg commercial loan trust the trust  which issued two classes of series notes 
the facility is secured by all of the trust s commercial loans which were contributed by us and totaled million as of december  and million as of december  this facility is scheduled to terminate on february  or sooner upon full repayment of the class a and class b notes 
the class a and class b notes are scheduled to be repaid as we receive principal collections on the underlying collateral 
the trust issued million of class a notes rated aaa aaa aaa  and million of class b notes rated a a a the series class a asset backed bonds and series class b asset backed bonds as rated by standard poor s  moody s and fitch  respectively 
as of december   million of the series notes were outstanding and million were outstanding as of december  the series class a asset backed bonds bear interest of libor plus and series class b asset backed bonds bear interest of libor plus  and interest on both is payable quarterly

table of contents dividends we intend to make distributions on a quarterly basis to our stockholders of all of our income  except for certain net capital gains and adjustments for long term incentive compensation expense 
we intend to make deemed distributions to our stockholders of any retained net capital gains 
we have elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the internal revenue code 
in order to maintain our status as a regulated investment company  we are required to i distribute at least of our investment company taxable income and of any ordinary pre ric built in gains we recognize between january  and december   less any taxes due on those gains to avoid corporate level taxes on the amount distributed to stockholders other than any built in gain recognized between january  and december  and ii distribute actually or on a deemed basis at least of our income both ordinary income and net capital gains to avoid an excise tax 
through december   we have made distributions in excess of our earnings of approximately million 
in addition  through december   we have net unrealized depreciation on our investments of million 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time 
in addition  we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings applicable to us as a business development company under the investment company act of and due to provisions in our credit facilities 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually  we will suffer adverse tax consequences  including possible loss of our status as a regulated investment company 
we cannot assure shareholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level 
the following table summarizes our dividends declared and paid on all shares  including restricted stock  to date date declared record date payment date amount february  march  april  october  november  january  july  august  october  april  may  july  march  april  april  december  december  january  august  august  october  june  june  july  march  april  april  december  december  january  september  october  october  june  june  july  march  april  april  december  january  january  total declared prior to becoming a business development company  we did not make distributions to our stockholders  but instead retained all of our income 
the aggregate dividend of per share in december consisted of a dividend of per share for the fourth quarter of and an additional dividend of per share representing the distribution of substantially all of our earnings and profits since inception through december  the aggregate dividend of declared in september consisted of a dividend of per share for the third quarter of and an additional dividend of per share which represented the remaining distribution of our earnings and profits since inception through december  the aggregate dividend declared in december along with the dividend declared in september  were required for us to qualify as a regulated investment company 
a return of capital for federal income tax purposes  which we call a tax return of capital  of per share and per share occurred with respect to the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents each year a statement on form div identifying the source of the dividend ie  paid from ordinary income  paid from net capital gains on the sale of securities  and or a return of paid in capital surplus which is a nontaxable distribution is mailed to our stockholders 
to the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our dividends for that fiscal year  a portion of those dividend distributions may be deemed a tax return of capital to our stockholders 
related party transactions prior to election to be regulated as a business development company  we terminated our stock option plan and adopted a restricted stock program under which we issued  shares of restricted common stock to employees and directors 
the total number of shares issued for the termination of the option plan was based upon the black scholes option pricing model and assumptions and approved by our board of directors 
see note i to consolidated financial statements 
additionally  in connection with the termination of our stock option plan  certain executive officers and employees purchased a portion of the  shares of restricted common stock at a per share price of 
those executive officers and employees issued partially non recourse notes to us  with an aggregate face value of million secured by approximately million shares with a value of million at the initial public offering price 
the notes are payable at the end of a four and a half year term  subject to acceleration  bear interest at payable annually and are secured by all of the restricted common stock held by such employee and for some employees  for a specified time period  additional shares of our common stock the employee owns 
the notes are non recourse as to the principal amount but recourse as to the interest 
amounts due on these loans are reflected as a reduction of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 
in the first quarter of  as part of a review of our executive compensation  the compensation committee of our board of directors agreed with certain of our executive officers to allow the forfeiture restrictions to lapse with respect to their tier i and tier ii shares immediately upon full repayment of the partially nonrecourse promissory notes that are secured by the restricted stock 
in addition  the compensation committee waived the performance based forfeiture restrictions and modified the time based forfeiture provisions associated with the tier iii shares through their respective amended and restated restricted stock agreements 
the expense associated with the modifications totaled million for  of which million was expensed in the first quarter 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
income recognition interest on commercial loans is computed by methods that generally result in level rates of return on principal amounts outstanding 
when a loan becomes days or more past due  or if we otherwise do not expect the customer to be able to service its debt and other obligations  we will  as a general matter  place the loan on non accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that loan until all principal has been paid 
however  we may make exceptions to this policy if the investment is well secured and in the process of collection 
paid in kind interest we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash  such as contractual paid in kind pik interest  which represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term 
we will cease accruing pik if we do not expect the customer to be able to pay all principal and interest due 
in certain cases  a customer makes principal payments on its loan prior to making 
table of contents payments to reduce the pik loan balances and  therefore  the pik portion of a customer s loan can increase while the total outstanding amount of the loan to that customer may stay the same or decrease 
pik loans represented million or of our portfolio of investments as of december  and million or of our portfolio of investments as of december  pik related activity for the years ended december  and was as follows year ended december  dollars in millions beginning pik loan balance pik interest earned during the period change in interest receivable on pik loans principal payments of cash on pik loans pik loans converted to other securities realized loss ending pik loan balance as noted above  in certain cases  a customer may make principal payments on its loan that are contractually applied first to the non pik loan balance instead of the pik loan balance 
if all principal payments from these customers had been applied first to any pik loan balance outstanding at the time of the payment  and any remainder applied to the non pik loan balance  an additional million of payments would have been applied against the december  pik loan balance of million and an additional million of payments would have been applied against the december  pik loan balance of million 
as of december   of the million of pik loans outstanding have an investment rating of or better and as of december   of the million of pik loans outstanding had an investment rating of or better 
the net increase in loan balances as a result of contracted pik arrangements are separately identified on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
dividends certain of our equity investments have stated accruing dividend rates 
we accrue dividends on our equity investments as they are earned to the extent there is sufficient value to support the ultimate payment of those dividends 
loan origination fees loan origination fees are deferred and amortized as adjustments to the related loan s yield over the contractual life of the loan 
in certain loan arrangements  warrants or other equity interests are received from the borrower as additional origination fees 
the borrowers granting these interests are typically non publicly traded companies 
we record the financial instruments received at fair value as determined by our board of directors 
fair values are determined using various valuation models which attempt to estimate the underlying value of the associated entity 
these models are then applied to our ownership share considering any discounts for transfer restrictions or other terms which impact the value 
changes in these values are recorded through our statement of operations 
any resulting discount on the loan from recordation of warrant and other equity instruments are accreted into income over the term of the loan 
we had million and million of unearned income as of december  and december   respectively 

table of contents unearned income activity for the years ended december  and was as follows year ended december  in millions cash received equity interest and future receivables total cash received equity interest and future receivables total beginning unearned income balance additional fees unearned income recognized unearned fees applied against loan balance a ending unearned income balance a when a loan is paid off at an amount below our cost basis  we apply any fees received that have not been recognized as income against the outstanding loan amount to reduce the cost basis  which has the effect of reducing any realized loss 
other fees in certain investment transactions  we may perform consulting or advisory services 
for services that are separately identifiable and external evidence exists to substantiate fair value  income is recognized as earned which is generally when the investment transaction closes 
valuation of investments value  as defined in section a of the investment company act of  is i the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and ii for all other securities and assets  fair value is as determined in good faith by the board of directors 
since there is typically no readily available market value for the investments in our portfolio  we value substantially all of our investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the board of directors pursuant to a valuation policy and a consistent valuation process 
at december   approximately of our total assets represented investments of which approximately are valued at fair value and approximately are valued at market value based on readily ascertainable public market quotes at december  because of the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value  the fair value of our investments determined in good faith by the board of directors may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for the investments  and the differences could be material 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith 
as a result  determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment 
unlike banks  we are not permitted to provide a general reserve for anticipated loan losses 
instead  we must determine the fair value of each individual investment on a quarterly basis 
we will record unrealized depreciation on investments when we believe that an investment has decreased in value  including where collection of a loan or realization of an equity security is doubtful 
conversely  we will record unrealized appreciation if we believe that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and  therefore  our investment has also appreciated in value  where appropriate 
as a business development company  we invest primarily in illiquid securities including debt and equity securities of private companies 
the structure of each debt and equity security is specifically negotiated to enable us to protect our investment and maximize our returns 
we generally include many terms governing interest rate  repayment terms  prepayment penalties  financial covenants  operating covenants  ownership and corporate governance parameters  dilution parameters  liquidation preferences  voting rights  and put or call rights 
in many cases  our loan agreements also allow for increases in the spread to the base index rate if the financial or 
table of contents operational performance of the customer deteriorates or shows negative variances from the customer s business plan and  in some cases  allow for decreases in the spread if financial or operational performance improves or exceeds the customer s plan 
our investments are generally subject to some restrictions on resale and generally have no established trading market 
because of the type of investments that we make and the nature of our business  our valuation process requires an analysis of various factors 
our fair value methodology includes the examination of  among other things  the underlying investment performance  financial condition and market changing events that impact valuation 
with respect to private debt and equity securities  each investment is valued using industry valuation benchmarks  and  where appropriate  the value is assigned a discount reflecting the illiquid nature of the investment and or our minority  non control position 
when an external event such as a purchase transaction  public offering  or subsequent debt or equity sale occurs  the pricing indicated by the external event will be used to corroborate our private debt or equity valuation 
securities that are traded in the over the counter market or on a stock exchange generally will be valued at the prevailing bid price on the date of the relevant period end 
however  restricted or thinly traded public securities may be valued at discounts from the public market value due to the restrictions on sale 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
for restricted common stock issued to employees for whom no return based criteria apply  compensation expense  equal to the value of the shares at the later of the grant date or the date at which all return based forfeiture provisions lapsed or were removed  is recorded over the term of the forfeiture provisions 
see note i to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our employee stock plans 
securitization transactions periodically  we transfer pools of loans to special purpose entities spes for use in securitization transactions 
these on balance sheet securitization transactions comprise a significant source of our overall funding  with the total face amount of the outstanding loans and equity investments assumed by third parties equaling million at december  and million at december  on april   the company adopted the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  which applies prospectively to all securitization transactions occurring after march  adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our operations or financial position 
transfers of loans have not met the requirements of sfas no 
for sales treatment and are  therefore  treated as secured borrowings  with the transferred loans remaining in investments and the related liability recorded in borrowings 
recent developments in january  one of our majority owned controlled portfolio companies  bridgecom holdings  inc bridgecom completed a merger with broadview networks  inc broadview 
as part of this transaction  we increased our investment by approximately million 
however  our ownership in the new merged entity decreased to below percent and therefore bridgecom is no longer a majority owned portfolio company 
as of december  we had debt and equity securities of bridgecom with a total fair value of million and unrealized appreciation of million 
in connection with this transaction  we expect to record a realized gain of approximately million during the first quarter of and expect this realized gain to be fully offset by the reversal of the related unrealized appreciation 
as of december   there was approximately million of unearned income associated with this investment that we expect to recognize in connection with this transaction 

table of contents in connection with the merger between bridgecom and broadview  we exchanged certain preferred stock securities of bridgecom with a fair value of approximately million for preferred stock securities of the combined entity which entitles us to a preferred claim of approximately million  plus dividends which will accumulate at an annual rate of on our preferred claim 
we expect to recognize these dividends as income on a quarterly basis  however  our ability to record income related to these accumulating dividends will be dependent upon the performance of the combined entity 
in february  one of our majority owned controlled portfolio companies  corporate legal times  llc corporate legal times  was sold 
as of december  we had debt and equity securities of corporate legal times with a total fair value of million and unrealized depreciation of million 
in connection with this transaction  we expect to record a realized loss of million and expect this realized loss to be fully offset by the reversal of the related unrealized depreciation 
in february  one of our non majority owned controlled portfolio companies  creatas  llc creatas  signed an agreement to be acquired by jupitermedia corporation  a publicly held corporation 
we expect this transaction to close during the first quarter of the consideration to be paid by jupitermedia corporation is a combination of cash and approximately  shares of jupitermedia corporation common stock 
as of december   we had creatas debt and equity securities with a total fair value of million and unrealized appreciation of million 
this value approximates the value of the consideration we would receive in this transaction as of the date the agreement was signed  at which time jupitermedia corporation s common stock was trading at a price of per share 
the actual realized gain or loss on this transaction will be based on the value of the consideration paid at the date of closing  which is subject to market fluctuations in jupitermedia corporation s common stock 
to the extent the value of jupitermedia corporation s common stock changes between the date the agreement was signed and the date the transaction closes or thereafter  it will have an impact on our results of operations in future periods 
on march   the closing price of jupitermedia corporation s common stock was per share  which would equate to a loss of approximately million 
the total change in value of the consideration from the date of the agreement to the date of closing  which may be more or less than the million through march   will be reflected in our results of operations in on february   two of our portfolio companies  ids telecom  llc and cleartel communications  inc  entered into an asset purchase agreement whereby cleartel communications will acquire ids telecom 
the merger is expected to close in the second quarter of and is subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions 
there can be no assurance as to the timing of closing or that the transaction will close

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
r in the third quarter of under sfas no 
r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the permitted 
table of contents transition methods include either retrospective or prospective adoption 
under the retrospective option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas no 
r  while the retrospective methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options beginning with the first period presented 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas no 
r and expect that adoption of sfas no 
r will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas no 
r  and we have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas no 

table of contents risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should consider carefully the risks described below and all other information contained in this annual report  including our financial statements and the related notes and the schedules and exhibits to this annual report 
risks related to our business and financial results we have a limited operating history as a business development company and as a regulated investment company  which may impair your ability to assess our prospects 
prior to our initial public offering in december  we had not operated as a business development company under the investment company act of or as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the internal revenue code 
as a result  we have limited operating results under these regulatory frameworks that can demonstrate to you either their effect on our business or our ability to manage our business under these frameworks 
in addition  prior to our initial public offering  our management had no prior experience managing a business development company or regulated investment company 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate successfully as a business development company and a regulated investment company 
because there is generally no established market for which to value our investments  our board of directors determination of the value of our investments may differ materially from the values that a ready market or third party would attribute to these investments 
under the act  we are required to carry our portfolio investments at market value or  if there is no readily available market value  at fair value as determined by our board 
we are not permitted to maintain a general reserve for anticipated loan losses 
instead  we are required by the act to specifically value each individual investment and to record any unrealized depreciation for any asset that we believe has decreased in value 
because there is typically no public market for the loans and equity securities of the companies in which we invest  our board will determine the fair value of these loans and equity securities on a quarterly basis pursuant to our valuation policy 
because of the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value  the fair value of our investments determined in good faith by the board of directors may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for the investments  and the differences could be material 
we make loans to and invest in primarily small and medium sized privately owned companies  which may default on their loans  thereby reducing or eliminating the return on our investments 
our portfolio primarily consists of loans to and securities issued by small and medium sized privately owned businesses 
compared to larger publicly owned firms  these companies may be more vulnerable to economic downturns  may have more limited access to capital and higher funding costs  may have a weaker financial position  and may need more capital to expand or compete 
these businesses also may experience substantial variations in operating results 
they may face intense competition  including from companies with greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
typically  they also depend for their success on the management talents and efforts of an individual or a small group of persons 
the death  disability or resignation of any of their key employees could harm their financial condition 
furthermore  some of these companies do business in regulated industries and could be affected by changes in government regulation 
accordingly  these factors could impair their cash flow or result in other events  such as bankruptcy  which could limit their ability to repay their obligations to us  and may adversely affect the return on  or the recovery of  our investment in these businesses 
deterioration in a borrower s financial condition and prospects may be accompanied by deterioration in any collateral for the loan 
some of these companies may be unable to obtain financing from public capital markets or from traditional credit sources  such as commercial banks 
accordingly  advances made to these types of customers may entail a 
table of contents higher risk of loss than advances made to customers who are able to utilize traditional credit sources 
these conditions may also make it difficult for us to obtain repayment of our loans 
furthermore  there is generally no publicly available information about such companies and we must rely on the diligence of our employees to obtain information in connection with our investment decisions 
if we are unable to uncover all material information about these companies  we may not make a fully informed investment decision and we may lose money on our investments 
if the industry sectors in which our portfolio is currently concentrated experience adverse economic or business conditions  our operating results may be negatively impacted 
currently our customer base is primarily in the communications  information services  media  technology  software and business services industry sectors 
these sectors are characterized by high margins  high growth rates  consolidation and product and market extension opportunities 
value often is vested in intangible assets and intellectual property 
these customers can experience adverse business conditions or risks related to their industries 
accordingly  if our customers suffer as some customers currently are due to these adverse business conditions or risks or due to economic slowdowns or downturns in these industry sectors  we will be more vulnerable to losses in our portfolio and our operating results may be negatively impacted 
furthermore  if demand for financing by existing and new customers in these industries declines  we may not be able to increase our lending and investment volume and our operating results will be adversely affected 
our financial results could be negatively affected if bridgecom holdings  inc fails to perform as expected 
at december   our largest portfolio investment was bridgecom holdings  inc bridgecom  which totaled million at value  or of the fair value of our investments 
in connection with the merger between bridgecom and broadview networks  inc  which closed during january  we acquired preferred securities of the combined entity  which entitles us to a preferred claim of approximately million  plus dividends  which will accumulate at an annual rate of on our preferred claim 
we expect to recognize these dividends as income on a quarterly basis  however  our ability to record income related to these accumulating dividends will be dependent upon the performance of the combined entity 
our financial results could be negatively affected if this portfolio company fails to perform as expected 
economic downturns or recessions could impair our customers ability to repay our loans  harm our operating results and reduce our volume of new loans 
many of our customers may be susceptible to economic downturns or recessions and may be unable to repay our loans during these periods 
therefore  our non performing assets are likely to increase and the value of our portfolio is likely to decrease during these periods 
adverse economic conditions also may decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans and the value of our equity investments 
economic downturns or recessions could lead to financial losses in our portfolio and a decrease in net income 
unfavorable economic conditions could also lead to a decrease in revenues and assets 
an economic downturn could disproportionately impact the industry sectors in which we concentrate causing us to be more vulnerable to losses in our portfolio and experience diminished demand for capital in these industry sectors and  consequently  our operating results may be negatively impacted 
unfavorable economic conditions also could increase our funding costs  limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us 
these events could prevent us from increasing our loan originations and investments and harm our operating results 

table of contents if we fail to qualify as a regulated investment company  we will have to pay corporate level taxes on our income and our income available for distribution would be reduced 
we have elected to be taxed for federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the internal revenue code 
if we can meet certain requirements  including source of income  asset diversification and distribution requirements  as well as if we continue to qualify as a business development company  we will qualify to be a regulated investment company and will not have to pay corporate level taxes on any income we distribute to our stockholders as dividends  allowing us to substantially reduce or eliminate our corporate level tax liability 
covenants and provisions in our credit facilities limit the ability of our subsidiaries and our securitization trusts to make distributions to us  which could affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and to maintain our status as a regulated investment company 
in addition  we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to make distributions to our stockholders because in certain cases we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income 
if we fail to qualify as a regulated investment company  we will have to pay corporate level taxes on all of our income whether or not we distribute it  which would substantially reduce the amount of income available for distribution to our stockholders 
even if we qualify as a regulated investment company  we generally will be subject to a corporate level income tax on the income we do not distribute 
moreover  if we do not distribute at least of our income  we generally will be subject to a excise tax 
see regulation as a business development company and certain us federal income tax considerations taxation as a regulated investment company 
because we will distribute substantially all of our income to our stockholders  we will continue to need additional capital to finance our growth 
if additional capital is unavailable or not available on favorable terms  our ability to grow will be impaired 
in order to satisfy the requirements applicable to a regulated investment company  we intend to distribute to our stockholders all of our income except for certain net capital gains 
we expect to elect to make deemed distributions to our stockholders of the retained net capital gains 
in addition  as a business development company  we generally will be required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total senior securities  which includes all of our borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future  of at least 
this requirement limits the amount that we may borrow 
because we will continue to need capital to grow our loan and investment portfolio  this limitation may prevent us from incurring debt and require us to raise additional equity at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so 
additional financing may not be available on favorable terms  if at all  or may be restricted by the terms of our securitization facilities 
if additional funds are not available to us  we could be forced to curtail or cease our new lending and investment activities  and our net asset value could decrease 
we have substantial indebtedness and servicing our indebtedness could reduce funds available to grow our business or make new investments 
as of december   we had million of outstanding borrowings under our debt facilities 
as a result  our current financial structure has a high proportion of debt and our debt service is substantial 
as of december   the weighted average annual interest rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was 
in order for us to cover our annual interest payments on indebtedness  we must achieve annual returns on our december  total assets of at least 
our ability to service our debt depends largely on our financial performance and will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and competitive pressures 
in addition  our subsidiaries have sold some of our loans to trusts that serve as the vehicles for our securitization facilities  and we do not hold legal title to these assets 
however  we bear losses of principal and interest from defaults on these loans held by the trusts up to the amount of our retained interest in the trusts  which was approximately million as of december  our securitization facilities impose financial and operating covenants that restrict our business activities  including limitations that could hinder our ability to finance additional loans and investments or to make the distributions required to maintain our status as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the internal revenue code 

table of contents borrowings  also known as leverage  magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and  therefore  increase the risks associated with investing in our securities 
leverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique 
if the value of our consolidated assets increases  then leveraging would cause the net asset value attributable to our common stock to increase more than it otherwise would have had we not utilized leverage 
conversely  if the value of our consolidated assets decreases  leveraging would cause net asset value attributable to our common stock to decline more than it otherwise would have had we not utilized leverage 
similarly  any increase in our consolidated revenue in excess of consolidated interest expense on our borrowed funds would cause our net income to increase more than it would without the use of leverage 
any decrease in our consolidated revenue would cause net income to decline more than it would have had we not borrowed funds and could negatively affect our ability to make distributions on our common stock 
as a business development company  we generally are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total borrowings and other senior securities  which include all of our borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future  of at least 
if this ratio declines below  we may not be able to incur additional debt and may need to sell a portion of our investments to repay some debt when it is disadvantageous to do so  and we may not be able to make distributions 
at december   this ratio was approximately 
in addition  because substantially all of our assets and liabilities are priced using various short term rate indices  including one month to six month libor  commercial paper rates and the prime rate  the timing of changes in market interest rates or in the relationship between interest rate indices could affect the interest rates earned on interest earning assets differently than the interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  which could result in a decrease in net income 
if we are not able to refinance our debt or able to do so on favorable terms  we would not be able to operate our business in the ordinary course 
our senior secured credit facility is scheduled to expire on september  and our million warehouse financing facility through three pillars funding  llc is scheduled to terminate on november  further  our million warehouse financing facility is subject to annual renewal by the lender 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to extend the terms of these facilities or obtain sufficient funds to repay any amounts outstanding under these facilities before they expire or terminate either from a replacement facility or alternative debt or equity financing 
if we are unable to repay amounts outstanding under these facilities and are declared in default or are unable to refinance these facilities  we would not be able to operate our business in the regular course 
even if we are able to refinance our debt  we may not be able to do so on favorable terms 
you may not receive distributions 
we intend to make distributions on a quarterly basis to our stockholders 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time 
in addition  due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a business development company  we may be limited in our ability to make distributions 
see regulation as a business development company 
also  restrictions and provisions in our debt facilities limit our ability to make distributions 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually  we will suffer adverse tax consequences  including possible loss of our status as a regulated investment company 
we cannot assure you that you will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level 
we may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and tax regulations  we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash  such as contracted payment in kind interest  which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance and due at the end of the loan term 
the increases in loan 
table of contents balances as a result of contracted payment in kind arrangements are included in income in advance of receiving cash payment  and are separately identified on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income  we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income to maintain regulated investment company tax treatment

if we fail to manage our growth  our financial results could be adversely affected 
we have expanded our operations significantly since purchasing our business from first union national bank in our growth has placed and could continue to place significant strain on our management systems and resources 
we must continue to refine and expand our marketing capabilities  our management of the investment process  our access to financing resources and our technology 
as we grow  we must continue to hire  train  supervise and manage new employees 
we may not develop sufficient lending and administrative personnel and management and operating systems to manage our expansion effectively 
if we are unable to manage our growth  our operations could be adversely affected and our financial results could be adversely affected 
if we need to sell any of our investments  we may not be able to do so at a favorable price and  as a result  we may suffer losses 
our investments are usually subject to contractual or legal restrictions on resale or are otherwise illiquid because there is usually no established trading market for such investments 
the illiquidity of most of our investments may make it difficult for us to dispose of them at a favorable price  and  as a result  we may suffer losses 
in addition  if we were forced to immediately liquidate some or all of the investments in our portfolio  the proceeds of such liquidation could be significantly less than the current value of such investments 
we may be required to liquidate some or all of our portfolio to meet our debt service obligations or to maintain our qualification as a business development company and as a regulated investment company if we do not satisfy one or more of the applicable criteria under the respective regulatory frameworks 
our business depends on our key personnel 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of bryan j 
mitchell  our chief executive officer  steven f 
tunney  our president and chief operating officer  b 
hagen saville  one of our executive vice presidents  and robert j 
merrick  our chief credit officer  as well as other key personnel 
the loss of any of these key employees would likely have a significant detrimental effect on our business 
in addition  if any two of mr 
mitchell  mr 
saville  mr 
tunney or mr 
merrick cease to be actively involved in our management  the lender under one of our warehouse financing facilities could  absent a waiver or cure  replace us as the servicer of the loans and declare a default 
in addition  if any two of mr 
mitchell  mr 
tunney or mr 
saville cease to be an executive officer of mcg actively involved in the management of mcg  the lender of our million senior secured credit facility could  absent a waiver or cure  declare a default 
fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our income 
a significant increase in market interest rates could harm our ability to attract new customers and originate new loans and investments  our non performing assets could increase and the value of our portfolio could decrease because our floating rate loan customers may be unable to meet higher payment obligations 
conversely  a significant decrease in interest rates would reduce our net income  all other things being equal 
a decrease in interest rates may reduce net income despite the increased demand for our capital that the decrease in interest rates may produce 
approximately of the loans in our portfolio  based on amounts outstanding at cost as of december   were at variable rates determined on the basis of a benchmark libor or prime rate and approximately were at fixed rates 
from october  to december   three month libor has increased from to 

table of contents regulations governing our operation as a business development company will affect our ability to  and the way in which we  raise additional capital 
we have issued debt securities and may issue debt securities and or borrow money from banks or other financial institutions  which we refer to collectively as senior securities  up to the maximum amount permitted by the act 
under the provisions of the act  we are permitted  as a business development company  to issue senior securities only in amounts such that our asset coverage  as defined in the act  equals at least after each issuance of senior securities 
if the value of our assets declines  we may be unable to satisfy this test 
if that happens  we may be required to sell a portion of our investments and  depending on the nature of our leverage  repay a portion of our indebtedness at a time when such sales may be disadvantageous 
we are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share 
we may  however  sell our common stock  or warrants  options or rights to acquire our common stock  at a price below the current net asset value of the common stock if our board of directors determines that such sale is in the best interests of mcg and its stockholders  and our stockholders approve such sale 
in any such case  the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which  in the determination of our board of directors  closely approximates the market value of such securities less any distributing commission or discount 
any change in regulation of our business could negatively affect the profitability of our operations 
changes in the laws  regulations or interpretations of the laws and regulations that govern business development companies  regulated investment companies or non depository commercial lenders could significantly affect our operations and our cost of doing business 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations and are subject to judicial and administrative decisions that affect our operations 
if these laws  regulations or decisions change  or if we expand our business into jurisdictions that have adopted more stringent requirements than those in which we currently conduct business  we may have to incur significant expenses in order to comply or we might have to restrict our operations 
our ability to invest in private companies may be limited in certain circumstances 
if we are to maintain our status as a business development company  we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets unless  at the time of and after giving effect to such acquisition  at least of our total assets are qualifying assets 
if we acquire debt or equity securities from an issuer that has outstanding marginable securities at the time we make an investment  these acquired assets generally cannot be treated as qualifying assets 
this result is dictated by the definition of eligible portfolio company under the act  which in part focuses on whether a company has outstanding marginable securities 
amendments promulgated in by the board of governors of the federal reserve system expanded the definition of a marginable security under the federal reserve s margin rules to include any non equity security 
thus  any debt securities issued by any entity are marginable securities under the federal reserve s current margin rules 
as a result  the staff of the sec has raised the question as to whether a private company that has outstanding debt securities would qualify under the relevant portion of the eligible portfolio company criteria 
the sec has recently issued proposed rules to include any company that does not have a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or association in the definition of eligible portfolio company 
until the question raised by the staff of the sec pertaining to the federal reserve s change to its margin rules has been addressed by final legislative  administrative or judicial action  we intend to treat as qualifying assets only those debt and equity securities that are issued by a private company that has no marginable securities outstanding at the time we purchase such securities or that otherwise qualifies as an eligible portfolio company under the act

we have interest rate risk exposure mainly from the portion of the commercial loan portfolio funded using stockholders equity 
our board of directors assesses interest rate risk and we manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis

we monitor this strategy on an ongoing basis and may engage in certain hedging activities in the future as we deem appropriate
