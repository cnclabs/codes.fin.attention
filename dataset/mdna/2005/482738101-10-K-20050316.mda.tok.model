item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those discussed under the heading risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we develop  manufacture and market mobile satellite communications products for the land and marine markets  and navigation  guidance and stabilization products for defense and commercial markets 
our mobile satellite communications products enable customers to receive live digital television  telephone and internet services in their automobiles  recreational vehicles and marine vessels while in motion 
we sell our mobile satellite communications products through an extensive international network of independent retailers  chain stores and distributors  as well as to manufacturers of marine vessels and recreational vehicles 
our defense products include tactical navigation systems that provide uninterrupted navigation and pointing information in a broad range of military vehicles  including tactical trucks hmmwvs and combat vehicles 
we also offer precision fiber optic gyro based systems that help stabilize platforms such as gun turrets and radar units  provide guidance for munitions and support a range of commercial and industrial applications 
we sell our defense products directly to us and allied governments and government contractors  as well as through an international network of authorized independent sales representatives 
we entered the market for mobile satellite antenna systems in initially  we sold our antenna systems primarily to original equipment manufacturers 
in  we began to offer our mobile satellite communications products to customers under the kvh tracphone brand 
that year  we also introduced our first kvh branded satellite tv antenna for the marine market  the tracvision 
in  we introduced a more compact antenna for use on recreational vehicles and motor coaches 
in september  we introduced the tracvision a  which uses our low profile satellite tv antenna technology and is our first product for the automotive market 
in  we invented the first digital compass for use in sailing vessels 
since then  we have further developed and refined this technology to produce reliable precision navigation systems in military environments 
in  we acquired fiber optic gyro technology from andrew corporation to complement and enhance our existing navigation and inertial measurement systems 
we continue to develop new products for the defense industry 
in august  we introduced our newest tactical grade fiber optic gyro  the dsp this militarized system joins our dsp fiber optic gyro and the tg  our fiber optic gyro based inertial measurement unit  as the core of our fiber optic product line  which serves both military and commercial applications 
we expect to provide certain inertial measurement unit systems  such as those used in smart munitions applications  in partnership with other companies 
we generate revenue primarily from the sale of our mobile satellite communications and defense products 
we also generate a portion of our revenue from the sale of our legacy recreational navigation systems 
our legacy navigation product line includes digital compass based navigation products for the marine market 
the following table provides  for the periods indicated  our net sales by product line category 
year ended december  in thousands mobile satellite communications defense legacy net sales 
table of contents in addition to revenue from product sales  our mobile satellite communications revenue includes fees earned from product repairs  fees from satellite phone and internet usage services  and certain directv account referral fees earned in conjunction with the sale of our products 
we provide  for a fee  third party satellite phone and internet airtime to our tracphone and internet customers who choose to activate their subscriptions with us 
under current directv programs  we are eligible to receive a one time new mobile account activation fee from directv for each customer who activates their directv service directly through us 
our defense revenue primarily includes product sales to both military and commercial markets and to a lesser extent  engineering services provided under development contracts 
to date  revenues earned from product repairs  satellite phone and internet usage services  directv activations and earnings under development contracts have not been a material portion of our revenue 
our defense business is characterized by a small number of customers who place a small number of relatively large dollar value orders 
in the year ended december   our top four defense customers  including the us military as a single customer  accounted for of our net sales attributable to defense products and of our total net sales for all products 
in the year ended december   our top four customers  including the us military as a single customer  accounted for of our net sales attributable to defense products and of our total net sales for all products 
direct sales to the us military accounted for of our total net sales in the year ended december  and in the year ended december  orders for our defense products typically range in size from several hundred thousand dollars to over one million dollars 
accordingly  our quarterly net sales of defense products usually consist of only a few orders 
each order can have a significant impact on our net sales  and because our defense products generally have higher margins than our mobile satellite communications products  each order can have an impact on our net income that is disproportionately large relative to the revenue generated by the order 
moreover  customers of our defense products are predominantly governments and government contractors that typically must adhere to lengthy procurement processes  which make the timing of individual orders difficult to predict and often result in long sales cycles 
government customers and their contractors can generally cancel orders for our products for convenience 
we have historically derived a substantial portion of our revenue from sales to customers located outside the united states and canada 
the following table provides  for the periods indicated  sales to specified geographic regions year ended december  in thousands originating from north american locations united states and canada europe other total north america originating from european location europe other total europe net sales see note of notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our geographic segments 
since  we have made significant investments in research and development 
we completed a private placement of common stock in the first half of and used a substantial portion of the proceeds to develop 
table of contents new technologies  including a low profile satellite tv antenna and a high speed in fiber modulator 
we introduced our first product using our low profile satellite tv antenna technology  the tracvision a  in september a decline in the potential market for our in fiber modulator led us to conclude in the second half of that we should defer further significant investments in this technology until market demand increases 
during this period  we also continued to develop other products  including our dsp  dsp and tg fiber optic gyro based products 
over the last two years we have introduced several new products that were the result of investments that we made in advanced development during the timeframe 
as a result  in we were able to bring the total research and development expenses  as a percentage of revenue  to a level that we believe is appropriate for at least fiscal we anticipate that this level of investment will allow us to satisfactorily maintain our efforts in the areas of identifying and evaluating new and innovative satellite and navigation products based on our platform technologies  refining products for commercial introduction and improving manufacturing and development processes 
in addition to our internally funded research and development efforts  we also conduct research and development activities that are funded by our customers 
these activities relate primarily to the customization of our defense products to meet specific customer requirements 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we account for customer funded research as revenue  and we account for the associated research costs as cost of goods sold 
as a result  some of our expenditures for research and development activities are not included in the research and development expense that we calculate and present in our statement of operations 
the following table presents our total annual research effort  representing the sum of research cost of goods sold and the operating expense of research and development as described in our statement of operations 
our management believes this information is useful because it provides a better understanding of our total expenditures on research and development activities 
year ended december  in thousands research and development expense presented on statement of operations cost of customer funded research and development included in cost of goods sold total expenditures on research and development activities as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition revenue from product sales 
revenue from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  goods are shipped  title has passed and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we establish reserves for potential sales returns and allowances  and evaluate  on a monthly basis  the adequacy of those 
table of contents reserves based upon historical experience and our expectations for future returns 
our standard sales terms require that all sales are final  terms are either net or net  shipments are tendered and shipped fob or as may be applicable  fca  or exw kvh s plant or warehouse  and title and risk of loss or damage passes to the customer  dealer or distributor at the point of shipment when delivery is made to the possession of the carrier 
under certain limited conditions  kvh  at its sole discretion  provides for the return of goods 
no product is accepted for return and no credit is allowed on any returned product unless kvh has granted and confirmed prior written permission by means of appropriate authorization  and all products are returned in a pristine and re sellable condition 
see note of notes to our consolidated financial statements for disclosures associated with our significant customers  including customers 
accounts receivable our estimate for allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is primarily based on specific  historical criteria 
we evaluate specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations 
we make judgments  based on facts and circumstances  regarding the need to record a specific reserve for that customer against amounts owed to reduce the receivable to the amount that we expect to collect 
we also provide for a general reserve based on an aging analysis of our accounts receivable 
we evaluate these reserves on a monthly basis and adjust them as we receive additional information that impacts the amount reserved 
if circumstances change  we could change our estimates of the recoverability of amounts owed to us by a material amount 
for example  in the last quarter of  we created a specific reserve in the amount of  as a result of a voluntary liquidation of a european distributor 
this event substantially increased our allowance for doubtful accounts and reduced our accounts receivable accordingly 
inventories inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review current quantities on hand  actual and projected sales volumes and anticipated selling prices on products and write down slow moving and or obsolete inventory to its net realizable value 
generally  our inventory does not become obsolete because the materials we use are typically interchangeable among various product offerings 
if we overestimate projected sales or anticipated selling prices  our inventory might be overvalued  and we would have to reduce our inventory valuation accordingly 
see note of notes to our consolidated financial statements for disclosures associated with our tracvision a inventory revaluation and other special charges 
income taxes and deferred income tax assets and liabilities income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carry forwards 
on a quarterly basis  we assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets by considering whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
based on the history of operating losses in our ongoing business  we determined that it was more likely than not that portions of the deferred tax 
table of contents assets were not recoverable and therefore a valuation allowance was established 
we determined that the remaining deferred tax assets were recoverable based on a tax planning strategy derived from our ability to sell our headquarters property located in middletown  rhode island for the expressed purpose of generating taxable income to utilize operating loss carryforwards before they expire 
this tax strategy is not an action that we ordinarily would take but would take  if necessary  to realize tax benefits prior to expiration 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could change in the future if there are changes in the feasibility of our tax planning strategy or a movement in the estimated unrealized gains associated with our middletown property 
for example  as a result of a revaluation of the property in  the estimated net unrealized taxable gains associated with the land and building increased from approximately million to million  thereby generating an additional  release of deferred tax asset valuation reserve in in addition to our tax planning strategy  some portion or all of the previously reserved deferred tax assets could be realized in the future if we generate future earnings during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
results of operations the following table provides  for the periods indicated  certain financial data expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales tracvision a revaluation charge all other costs of sales total costs of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative loss from operations other income expense  net loss before income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit net loss years ended december  and operating summary net loss for the year ended december   was million  or per basic and diluted common share  and was significantly greater than the net loss of million  or per basic and diluted common share  in the year ended december  our results reflected a increase in sales over  offset primarily by a million  or percentage points of revenue  second quarter tracvision a lower of cost or market inventory and non cancelable future purchase commitment revaluation adjustment  and a percentage points of revenue decline in gross margin  excluding the tracvision a revaluation adjustment  primarily resulting from a shift in product sales mix away from our higher margin defense products and towards our relatively lower margin mobile satellite communication products 

table of contents total operating expenses increased by million or  from million in to million in due mostly to increased new product sales and marketing expenses  especially those related to the launch of the tracvision a  and  to a lesser extent  general and administrative professional fees 
as a percentage of sales  total operating expenses increased slightly from in to in  primarily as a result of increased sales and marketing expenses related to our new products 
net sales net sales for increased by million  or  to million from million in sales of our mobile satellite communications products  which include our tracvision a  continued to show strong growth  increasing to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to unit volume increases in our marine and land mobile satellite communications products  both in the u 
s and in europe 
sales results reflect our expansion within the mobile satellite communication markets  our introduction of new products  including the tracvision a for the automotive market and the tracvision g for the marine market  and increased sales to major distributors  large account retailers and marine and recreational vehicle original equipment manufacturers 
sales of our defense products decreased by million  or  to million in from million in a decline in sales of our tacnav tactical navigation systems represented the entire decline in defense sales  and was attributable to a shift in us government procurement priorities 
partially offsetting the decline of tacnav product sales within the defense markets was an million increase in sales of our fiber optic gyro products and a million increase in contracted engineering and product modification services 
the increase in our fiber optic gyro sales was primarily the result of new product offerings  including the dsp and the dsp fiber optic gyros and the tg  our fiber optic gyro based inertial measurement unit 
legacy marine and oem sensor shipments declined by from million in to million in this decline is consistent with the long term trend of declining sales for this class of products 
cost of sales our cost of sales consists of direct labor  materials and manufacturing overhead expenses used to produce our products as well as engineering costs related to customer funded research and development 
cost of sales for increased by million  or  to million from million in the resulting gross margin percentage decreased to in from in increases in the costs of sales for from primarily resulted from a million tracvision a lower of cost or market inventory and non cancelable future purchase commitment revaluation adjustment approximately gross margin points  a continued shift in the mix of product sales  away from our relatively higher margin defense products to our relatively lower margin mobile satellite communication products  including the tracvision a approximately gross margin points  we currently anticipate  at least for the near term  that the mix of defense products and satellite communications products will approximate the mix experienced in  and higher manufacturing support and overhead costs  primarily resulting from facility and systems infrastructure additions to support sales growth  and in part from increased warranty costs for new products approximately gross margin points 
the million charge described above resulted from our decision to lower the price of the tracvision a in june as the price reduction produced a lower of cost or market condition  we revalued certain tracvision a on hand inventory and future purchase commitments to the anticipated lower product costs of re designed components 
consequently  since the june revaluation  the tracvision a product cost has reflected this lower cost structure 
as we fulfill the future purchase commitments  we charge to costs of sales the portion of the cost attributable to our current  lower component costs  and we charge the excess against the accrued loss on tracvision a non cancelable future purchase commitments 
once we have fully consumed the 
table of contents on hand inventory and purchase commitments for the original components we will phase in the redesigned lower cost components 
we anticipate that the actual new component phase in process will begin during the first quarter of at present  we do not anticipate further lower of cost or market or non cancelable future purchase revaluation charges arising from the june price reduction decision 
although the go forward production costs for the tracvision a were reduced  the gross margin for the tracvision a remains considerably below the gross margins of all our other products 
as a consequence  the growth in the sales of the tracvision a as a percentage of our total sales has adversely affected the company s overall gross margin results 
operating expenses research and development expense consists of direct labor  materials  associated overhead expenses  and other direct costs in support of our internally funded product development activities 
all internal research and development costs are expensed in the period they are incurred 
total research and development expense decreased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  research and development expense decreased to in from in the decrease reflects a reduction of engineering investment following the introduction of several major new products  including the tracvision a and the tracvision g  as well as the dsp  dsp fiber optic gyros and the tg inertial measurement unit 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions for in house and third party sales representatives  travel expenses  sales literature  advertising and trade shows 
sales and marketing expense increased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  sales and marketing expense increased to in from in this increase was primarily a result of promotional and marketing activities directed at enhancing the market awareness of the tracvision a and other land mobile satellite communication products 
additional increases resulted from expanded recreational vehicle and marine oem  large account and trade show promotions  customer support programs and increased product sales commissions that scale with sales volume 
to a lesser extent  an increase in bad debt expense of million  of which approximately million was associated with a single european distributor  also contributed to the total increase 
general and administrative expense consists of costs attributable to our management  finance  accounting  management information systems  human resources  facility management  and outside professional services 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in legal and accounting compliance expenses accounted for the majority of our cost increases 
to a lesser extent  salary and salary related costs also contributed to this increase 
interest and other income interest and other income expense increased by million to million in from million in the majority  or million  was the result of higher interest income earned on the investment of approximately million received from our common stock public offering in february also adding to the increase were foreign currency gains  as well as improved investment yields stemming from rising interest rates 
income taxes during  we recorded a foreign income tax expense of approximately  as a result of profitability in our foreign subsidiary 
moreover  during we recorded an approximate million release of deferred tax asset valuation reserves tax benefit as a result of a revaluation of the net realizable deferred tax assets in connection with our tax planning strategy 
in  we recorded approximately million in tax benefit upon receiving a favorable outcome from an irs audit of our income tax returns for the fiscal years through the million recovery in was partially offset by  in foreign subsidiary taxes associated with local profitability 

table of contents years ended december  and operating summary net loss for was million  or per basic and diluted common share  and was approximately equal to the fiscal loss of million  or per basic and diluted common share 
the results included an increase in sales over  offset by a percentage point decline in gross margin and an increase in operating expenses 
the decline in gross margin from in to in was primarily due to a lower percentage of our higher margin military products and a high initial product cost of the tracvision a the increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of increased sales and marketing expenses associated with strong growth in sales of satellite communication products together with the initial product launch expenses for our tracvision a satellite tv antenna 
additional professional fees and increased salary and salary related expenses also contributed to the increase in operating expenses 
net sales net sales increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to a increase in sales volume of mobile satellite communications products and services  including our recently introduced tracvision a automotive antenna 
growth in our marine and land mobile satellite communication products primarily reflected our focus on the continued development and expansion of sales to major distributors  large account retailers and original equipment manufacturers 
defense sales decreased by million  or  to million in from million in sales of tactical navigation systems  including engineering services  were million  a decrease of million compared to the decrease in primarily reflected a reduction in demand compared to when the us military was preparing for conflicts in afghanistan and iraq 
fiber optic component sales increased by  or  to million in from million in legacy marine and oem sensor shipments declined by  or  to million in from million in the decline in our legacy product sales is consistent with the long term trend line for these non strategic products 
cost of sales cost of goods sold increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily the result of increases in sales and unit volume as well as the high initial per unit cost of the tracvision a customer funded research and development costs included in cost of goods sold during and were approximately  and million  respectively 
as cost of goods sold increased in relation to revenue  gross margin decreased to in from in the gross margin decline was primarily the result of decreased sales volumes of our higher margin defense related products coupled with the initial product cost of the tracvision a automotive antenna 
partially offsetting these factors were year over year improvements in product gross margin for our marine and land mobile satellite communications products 
manufacturing overhead  at of revenue in  was comparable with operating expenses research and development expense decreased by  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  research and development expense decreased to in from in the decrease was due primarily to reduced spending on our photonic fiber initiative 
both and spending levels reflected significant investment in our new low profile tracvision a satellite antenna 
sales and marketing expense increased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  sales and marketing expense decreased modestly to in 
table of contents from in the dollar increase resulted primarily from the costs to support strong growth of satellite communications sales and the initial tracvision a product launch and promotional activities 
also contributing to the increase were higher sales representative commissions that generally scale proportionately with sales volume  and expanded large account and trade show promotions within the marine and land mobile markets 
general and administrative expense increased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expense increased to in from in license and litigation settlement costs  professional fees and salary and salary related expenses accounted for the majority of our general and administrative cost increases 
income taxes in  we recorded an income tax benefit of million compared to income tax expense of  in the income tax benefit recorded in consisted primarily of a one time adjustment of approximately million to reflect the recovery of prior us taxes paid as well as a modest increase in a foreign deferred tax asset associated with our denmark subsidiary 
the one time us benefit resulted from the favorable outcome of an irs audit of our income tax returns for the fiscal years through the loss for did not result in any additional us income tax benefit because we accrued an equal and offsetting amount of tax valuation allowances 
for a further discussion of income taxes  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our operations from product sales  net proceeds from public and private equity offerings  bank financings  proceeds received from exercises of stock options  and to a lesser extent  equipment leasing and financing arrangements 
on february   we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting all associated offering expenses incurred in both and as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and million in working capital 
for the year ended december   we used million in cash to fund our operations 
cash flow from operations  as reconciled from our net loss of million for the year ended december  included the non cash adjustments of million for depreciation and amortization  million for the effect of the tracvision a lower of cost or market revaluation charge and million for increases in bad debt expense 
the increase in the bad debt expense was primarily due to additional reserves provided for the total balance of a european distributor who filed for a voluntary liquidation under local law in late net cash used in operating activities during also included the following a million reduction in accounts receivable and costs in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts associated with improved collection efforts  a million non cash deferred tax asset valuation reserve release tax benefit resulting from the unrealized appreciation in the assets supporting our tax planning strategy  a million inventory increase resulting from the expansion of our product offerings as well as build up of stocking levels in anticipation of future sales growth  and a million decrease in accounts payable and other accrued expenses primarily associated with the timing of payments 
net cash used in investing activities during was million and primarily represents the investment of cash in excess of near term operational needs into marketable securities 
we used million to purchase manufacturing and other capital equipment  primarily to support operational improvements  sales growth and development activities 

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities during was million 
in addition to our february million net equity offering proceeds  we also received million from common stock issuances under our employee stock option and stock purchase programs 
these proceeds were partially offset by million in principal payments on outstanding long term debt obligations 
currently  we have a revolving loan agreement with a bank that provides for a maximum available credit of million and expires on july  we pay interest on any outstanding amounts at a rate equal to  at our option  libor plus  or the greater of the federal funds effective rate plus or the bank s prime interest rate 
we pay monthly fees at an annual rate of on up to million of the unused portion of the loan facility 
the loan facility advances funds using an asset availability formula based upon our eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances  less a fixed reserve amount 
we may terminate the loan agreement prior to its full term without penalty  provided we give days written notice to the bank 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under the facility 
we believe that the million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with our other existing working capital  will be adequate to meet planned operating and capital requirements through the foreseeable future 
however  as the need or opportunity arises  we may seek to raise additional capital through public or private sales of securities or through additional debt financing 
there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain any additional funding or that such funding will be available on acceptable terms 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december   our contractual commitments consisted of a mortgage note payable  near term purchase order commitments  facility leases and equipment leases 
the principal repayment of the mortgage note is based on a year amortization schedule  but the term is years  requiring a balloon payment of million on february  there are no loan to value covenants in the loan that would require early pay down of the mortgage if the market value of the property should decline 
our purchase commitments include unconditional purchase orders for inventory and manufacturing materials  typically not exceeding months worth of consumption 
we are also obligated under multi year facility leases that terminate at various times between and our other operating leases represent vehicle and equipment operating leases 
the following table summarizes our obligations under these commitments at december  payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands mortgage and other loans purchase commitments facility lease obligations other operating lease obligations total purchase commitments includes approximately  in noncancellable tracvision a purchase commitments 
we have not entered into any off balance sheet commercial commitments  such as standby letters of credit  guarantees or standby repurchase obligations

forward looking statements trends  risks and uncertainties an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating our business 
if any of these risks  or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not significant  develops into an actual event  then our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
if that happens  the market price of our common stock could decline 
we may not be profitable in the future 
we have a history of unprofitable operations 
although we generated net income during four of the last eight fiscal quarters  we incurred net losses of million in and million in both of and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
the market for our mobile satellite tv products for minivans  suvs and other passenger vehicles is new and emerging  and our business may not grow as we expect 
our tracvision a is the first commercially available  low profile mobile satellite tv antenna practical for use on minivans  suvs and other passenger vehicles  and we began shipping the tracvision a in september 
table of contents accordingly  the market for this product is still new and emerging 
consumers may not respond favorably to live satellite tv in passenger vehicles  and the market may not accept the tracvision a the early stage of development of this market makes it difficult for us to predict customer demand accurately 
for example  although sales of the tracvision a grew quarter to quarter throughout  sales were still below our original expectations for the year 
we have  at times  experienced temporary issues related to our production process and availability of adequate component supply 
although we believe we have successfully addressed the issues that have arisen  similar issues or other latent defects in the tracvision a could adversely affect sales 
we believe the success of the tracvision a will depend upon consumers assessment of whether or not it meets their expectations for performance  quality  price and design 
for example  the tracvision a is designed only for use on open roads in the continental united states where there is a clear view of the transmitting satellite in the southern sky 
among the factors that could affect the success of the tracvision a are the extent to which customers perceive mobile satellite tv services as a luxury or a necessary convenience  the performance  price and availability of competing or alternative products relative to the tracvision a  the extent to which tracvision a gains the acceptance of the automotive oems  the extent to which customers prefer live tv over recorded media  customers willingness to pay monthly fees for satellite television service  difficulties or inconveniences associated with scheduling installation at the point of sale  poor performance arising from improper installation or installation of damaged equipment  our limited experience with marketing a product to the automotive market  which is substantially larger and more fragmented than our other markets  and the adoption of laws or regulations that restrict or ban live television or other video technology in vehicles 
we expect that others will introduce competing mobile satellite tv antennas for automobiles 
our tracvision a is the first commercially available  low profile mobile satellite tv antenna for use on minivans  suvs and other passenger vehicles 
any advantage we may have may erode as others enter this market 
raysat has announced its intention to offer a phased array satellite antenna for automobiles during the first half of audiovox has indicated that it also expects to offer the raysat antenna as an audiovox branded product 
winegard has also announced its intention to offer an in motion automotive satellite tv antenna 
in addition  sirius satellite radio announced in january that it intends to introduce in a service offering several streaming video channels through sirius existing satellite radio system 
in january  delphi corp  a prominent supplier of automotive parts  announced a new agreement with comcast corporation to work together to develop ways to allow users to select video content and transfer it to an in vehicle entertainment system 
no details were provided as to the time frame for a possible product 
these satellite antenna products may have a slightly lower profile and customers may delay purchasing the tracvision a in anticipation of the release of any of these products 
competition from any of these products could impair our ability to sell the tracvision a and may force us to reduce the price of the tracvision a moreover  delphi s long term relationships with automobile manufacturers may give it a significant advantage in selling mobile satellite tv antennas to those manufacturers 
we must achieve significant cost reductions for the tracvision a to reach our targeted profit margins 
our product profit margins for the tracvision a have been low since its introduction 
to reach our targeted profit margins  we must continue to significantly reduce our manufacturing costs for the tracvision a we may be unable to achieve the cost reductions necessary to increase our overall profit margins 
although we 
table of contents have cost reduction programs underway that include volume purchasing discounts and redesigning certain components using lower cost materials and processes  technological or other challenges may prevent us from achieving all of the necessary cost reductions 
moreover  if the price of the tracvision a is not attractive to a broad range of customers  we may be forced to further lower the price  which would further impair our product profit margins unless we are able to achieve corresponding cost reductions 
customers for tacnav and our other defense products include the us military and foreign governments  whose purchasing schedules and priorities can be unpredictable 
we sell tacnav and our other defense products to the us military and foreign military and government customers 
these customers have unusual purchasing requirements  which can make sales to those customers unpredictable 
factors that affect their purchasing decisions include new military and operational doctrines that affect military equipment needs  changes in tactical navigation requirements  changes in modernization plans for military equipment  priorities for current battlefield operations  delays in the testing and acceptance of our products  allocation of funding for military programs  sales cycles that are long and difficult to predict  and delays in military procurement schedules 
these factors can cause substantial fluctuations in sales of tacnav and our other defense products from period to period 
moreover  tacnav and most of our other defense products must meet military quality standards  and our products may not continue to meet existing standards or more rigorous standards adopted in the future 
any failure to meet military contract specifications may produce delays as we attempt to improve our design  development  manufacturing or quality control processes 
furthermore  government customers and their contractors can generally cancel orders for our products for convenience 
even under firm orders with government customers  funding must usually be appropriated in the budget process in order for the government to complete the contract 
the cancellation of or failure to fund orders for our products could substantially reduce our net sales 
only a few customers account for a substantial portion of our defense revenues  and the loss of any of these customers would substantially reduce our net sales 
we derive a substantial portion of our defense revenues from a small number of customers 
in the year ended december   our top four defense customers  including the us military as a single customer  accounted for of our net sales attributable to defense products and of our total net sales 
in the year ended december   our top four defense customers  including the us military as a single customer  accounted for of our net sales attributable to defense products and of our total net sales 
direct sales to the us military accounted for of our total net sales in the year ended december  and in the year ended december  the further loss of business from any of these customers could substantially reduce our net sales and results of operations and could seriously harm our business 
sales of tacnav and our other defense products generally consist of a few large orders  and the delay or cancellation of a single order would substantially reduce our net sales 
unlike our mobile satellite communications products  tacnav and our other defense products are purchased through orders that can generally range in size from several hundred thousand dollars to more than one 
table of contents million dollars 
as a result  the delay or cancellation of a single order could materially reduce our net sales and results of operations 
because our defense products typically have higher margins than our mobile satellite communications products  the loss of an order for defense products could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations 
we may fail to continue to increase the sale of our fiber optic products for commercial uses 
our fiber optic products have numerous commercial applications where mobile communication  navigation  stabilization and precision pointing are required 
for example  our fiber optic gyros have been used in commercial applications such as train location control and track geometry measurement systems  industrial robotics  and stabilization of tv cameras 
we may not be successful  however  in further developing and marketing our fiber optic products for commercial uses  which would limit the overall net sales of these products and limit our profitability accordingly 
shifts in our product mix toward our mobile satellite communications products may reduce our overall gross margins 
our mobile satellite communications products have historically had lower product margins than our defense products 
during  sales of our mobile satellite communications products grew while sales of defense products declined compared to if this change in the mix profile of satellite communications and defense products were to continue  it could result in lower gross margins in the future 
we depend on single manufacturing lines for our products  and any significant disruption in production could impair our ability to deliver our products 
we currently manufacture and assemble our products using individual production lines for each product category 
we have experienced manufacturing difficulties in the past  and any significant disruption to one of these production lines will require time either to reconfigure and equip an alternative production line or to restore the original line to full capacity 
some of our production processes are complex  and we may be unable to respond rapidly to the loss of the use of any production line 
for example  our production process uses some specialized equipment and custom molds that may take time to replace if they malfunction 
in that event  shipments would be delayed  which could result in customer or dealer dissatisfaction  loss of sales and damage to our reputation 
finally  we have only a limited capability to increase our manufacturing capacity in the short term 
if short term demand for our products exceeds our manufacturing capacity  our inability to fulfill orders in a timely manner could also lead to customer or dealer dissatisfaction  loss of sales and damage to our reputation 
we depend on sole or limited source suppliers  and any disruption in supply could impair our ability to deliver our products on time or at expected cost 
we obtain many key components for our products from third party suppliers  and in some cases we use a single or a limited number of suppliers 
any interruption in supply could impair our ability to deliver our products until we identify and qualify a new source of supply  which could take several weeks  months or longer and could increase our costs significantly 
in general  we do not have written long term supply agreements with our suppliers but instead purchase components through purchase orders  which exposes us to potential price increases and termination of supply without notice or recourse 
we do not generally carry significant inventories of product components  and this could magnify the impact of the loss of a supplier 
if we are required to use a new source of materials or components  it could also result in unexpected manufacturing difficulties and could affect product performance and reliability 
we may increase the international scope of our operations  which could disrupt our operations 
we currently manufacture all of our products in the us however  in order for us to improve our margin performance and overall profitability  we may find it necessary to evaluate the need to further increase the 
table of contents international scope of our operations 
this could include offshore manufacturing and or the increased sourcing of raw materials from foreign countries 
we have no prior experience in foreign manufacturing and we might not be successful in implementing or integrating such a program 
in addition  an increased reliance on foreign manufacturing and or raw material supply would lengthen our supply chain and increase the risk that a disruption in that supply chain would have a material adverse affect on our operations and financial performance 
any failure to maintain and expand our third party distribution relationships may limit our ability to penetrate markets for mobile satellite communications products 
we market and sell our mobile satellite communications products through an international network of independent retailers  chain stores and distributors  as well as to manufacturers of marine vessels and recreational vehicles 
if we are unable to maintain or increase the number of our distribution relationships  it could significantly reduce or limit our net sales 
in addition  our distribution partners may sell products of other companies  including competing products  and are not required to purchase minimum quantities of our products 
moreover  our distributors may operate on low product margins and could give higher priority to products with higher margins than ours 
we depend on others to provide programming for our tracvision products  internet access for our tracnet products  and telephone  fax and data services for our tracphone products 
our tracvision products include only the equipment necessary to receive satellite television services  we do not broadcast satellite television programming 
instead  customers must obtain programming from another source 
we currently offer marine and land mobile tracvision products compatible with the directv and dish network services in the continental united states  the expressvu service in canada and various other regional services in other parts of the world 
our tracvision a is compatible only with the directv service in the continental united states 
although directv is offerings its total choice mobile programming package at a price which we think should be attractive to consumers  directv has no obligation to continue to offer that package at the current price or at all 
if customers become dissatisfied with the programming  pricing  service  availability or other aspects of these satellite television services product or if any one or more of these services becomes unavailable for any reason  we could suffer a substantial decline in sales of our tracvision products 
the companies that operate these services have no obligation to inform us of technological or other changes  including discontinuation of the service  that could impair the performance of our tracvision products 
our tracphone and tracnet products currently depend on satellite services provided by third parties 
we rely on inmarsat for satellite communications services for our tracphone products 
we rely on telemar for tracnet service in europe 
we currently rely on bell expressvu for tracnet service in north america 
we have been informed  however that expressvu has elected to discontinue its broadband service later in we have therefore decided to temporarily withdraw the tracnet product from the us market while we review alternative services for tracnet systems already in use 
we also rely on globalstar  a subsidiary of thermo capital partners llc  for the satellite return link for tracnet 
if any of our vendors were unable to fulfill their obligations  we would need to seek alternate suppliers or solutions 
in that case  we may be required to retrofit or upgrade hardware and software as necessary to ensure the continued operation of the affected products 
we may incur significant delays and expenses in our efforts to make the necessary changes  and those efforts may be unsuccessful 
moreover  we may not be successful in identifying and entering into appropriate agreements with replacement suppliers on commercially reasonable terms  which would impair our ability to offer the affected products 
similarly  we may lose the goodwill of existing customers if any currently installed products cease to work for any extended period 
any such outcome could lead to a substantial reduction in sales 

table of contents our mobile satellite communications products depend on the availability of third party satellites  which face significant operational risks and could fail earlier than their expected useful lives 
our mobile satellite communications products depend on the availability of programming and services broadcast through satellites owned by third parties 
the unexpected failure of a satellite could disrupt the availability of programming and services  which could reduce the demand for  or customer satisfaction with  our products 
these satellites face significant operational risks while in orbit 
these risks include malfunctions that can occur as a result of satellite manufacturing errors  problems with power or control systems and general failures resulting from the harsh space environment 
moreover  each satellite has a limited useful life  and the satellite providers make no guarantees that the planned backup systems and capacity will be sufficient to support these satellite services in the event of a loss or reduction of service 
we cannot assure you that satellite services compatible with our products will continue to be available or that such services will continue to be offered at reasonable rates 
the accuracy or availability of satellite signals may also be limited by ionospheric or other atmospheric conditions  intentional or inadvertent signal interference  or intentional limitations on signal availability imposed by the satellite provider 
a reduction in the number of operating satellites on any system  the inoperability of any key satellite or the failure of any key satellite or satellites to provide an accurate or available signal could impair the utility of our products or the growth of current and additional market opportunities 
our net sales and operating results could decline due to general economic trends or declines in consumer spending 
our global operating performance depends significantly on general economic conditions 
net sales of our satellite communications products are largely generated by discretionary consumer spending  and demand for these products could demonstrate slower growth than we anticipate as a result of regional and global economic conditions 
consumer spending tends to decline during recessionary periods and may decline at other times 
consumers may choose not to purchase our mobile satellite communications products due to a perception that they are luxury items 
as global and regional economic conditions change  demand for our products could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to improve our existing mobile satellite communications and defense products and develop new  innovative products  our sales and market share may decline 
the markets for mobile satellite communications products and defense navigation  guidance and stabilization products are each characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product innovations  changes in customer requirements and expectations and evolving industry standards 
if we fail to make innovations in our existing products and reduce the costs of our products  our market share may decline 
products using new technologies  or emerging industry standards  could render our products obsolete 
if our competitors successfully introduce new or enhanced products that eliminate technological advantages our products may have in a certain market or otherwise outperform our products  or are perceived by consumers as doing so  we may be unable to compete successfully in the markets affected by these changes 
for example  other companies have either announced their intentions or have begun to offer low profile in motion satellite antennas 
these products will compete with our tracvision a and may offer more attractive performance  pricing and other features 
if we cannot effectively manage our growth  our business may suffer 
we have previously expanded our operations to pursue existing and potential market opportunities 
this growth placed a strain on our personnel  management  financial and other resources 
if we fail to manage our future growth properly  we may incur unnecessary expenses and the efficiency of our operations may decline 
for example  in order to pursue successfully the opportunities presented by the emerging tracvision a market  we must continue to expand our operations capabilities 
to manage our growth effectively  we must  among other things upgrade  expand or re size our manufacturing facilities and capacity in a timely manner  successfully attract  train  motivate and manage a larger number of employees for manufacturing  sales and customer support activities  
table of contents control higher inventory and working capital requirements  and improve the efficiencies within our operating  administrative  financial and accounting systems  and our procedures and controls 
we may be unable to hire and retain the skilled personnel we need to expand our operations 
to meet our growth objectives  we must attract and retain highly skilled technical  operational  managerial  and sales and marketing personnel 
if we fail to attract and retain the necessary personnel  we may be unable to achieve our business objectives and may lose our competitive position  which could lead to a significant decline in net sales 
we face significant competition for these skilled professionals from other companies  research and academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
our success depends on the services of our executive officers and key employees 
our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills and efforts of martin kits van heyningen  our co founder  president and chief executive officer 
if we lost the services of mr 
kits van heyningen  our business and operating results could be seriously harmed 
we also depend on the ability of our other executive officers and members of senior management to work effectively as a team 
none of our senior management or other key personnel is bound by an employment agreement 
the loss of one or more of our executive officers or senior management members could impair our ability to manage our business effectively 
competition may limit our ability to sell our mobile satellite communications products and defense products 
the mobile satellite communications markets and defense navigation  guidance and stabilization markets in which we participate are very competitive  and we expect this competition to persist and intensify in the future 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  which could impair our ability to sell our products 
to remain competitive  we must enhance our existing products and develop new products  and we may have to reduce the prices of our products 
moreover  new competitors may emerge  and entire product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of those product lines 
for example  improvements in less expensive wireless and cellular technologies may limit demand for land based satellite phone and internet services 
in the defense navigation  guidance and stabilization markets  we compete primarily with honeywell international inc  kearfott guidance navigation corporation  leica microsystems ag  northrop grumman corporation and smiths group plc 
in the market for mobile satellite communications products  we compete with a variety of companies 
in the land mobile market for satellite tv communications equipment  we compete directly with king controls  motosat  tracstar systems  inc  and winegard company 
there is also potential competition for sales of satellite tv to the automotive market from raysat  audiovox  winegard  and delphi 
in the marine market for satellite tv communications equipment  we compete with navisystem marine electronic systems srl  orbit satellite television radio network and sea tel  inc in the marine market for telephone  fax  data and internet communications equipment  we compete with furuno electric co  ltd  globalstar lp  iridium satellite llc  japan radio company and nera asa 
moreover  new competitors may surface in the future 
among the factors that may affect our ability to compete in our markets are the following many of our primary competitors are well established companies that could have substantially greater financial  managerial  technical  marketing  personnel and other resources than we do  product improvements or price reductions by competitors may weaken customer acceptance of our products  and our competitors may have lower production costs than we do  which may enable them to compete more aggressively in offering discounts and other promotions 

table of contents our international business operations expose us to a number of difficulties in coordinating our activities abroad and in dealing with multiple regulatory environments 
sales to customers outside the united states and canada accounted for approximately   and of our net sales in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have only one foreign sales office  which is located in denmark  and we otherwise support our international sales from our operations in the united states 
our limited operations in foreign countries may impair our ability to compete successfully in international markets and to meet the service and support needs of our customers in countries where we have no infrastructure 
we are subject to a number of risks associated with our international business activities  which may increase our costs and require significant management attention 
these risks include technical challenges we may face in adapting our mobile satellite communication products to function with different satellite services and technology in use in various regions around the world  including multiple satellite services in europe  restrictions on the sale of certain defense products to foreign military and government customers  additional costs and delays associated with obtaining approvals and licenses under applicable export regulations  increased costs of providing customer support in multiple languages  satisfaction of international regulatory requirements and procurement of any necessary licenses or permits  more limited protection of our intellectual property  potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors  which could slow our growth in international markets  potentially longer sales cycles  which could slow our revenue growth from international sales  potentially longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  losses arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  and economic and political instability in some international markets 
if we are unable to maintain adequate product liability insurance  we may have to pay significant monetary damages in a successful product liability claim against us 
the development and sale of mobile satellite communication products and defense products entail an inherent risk of product liability 
for example  consumers may ignore laws or warnings not to watch satellite television while driving and  as a result  may become involved in serious accidents  for which they may seek to hold us responsible 
product liability insurance is generally expensive for companies such as ours 
accordingly  we maintain only limited product liability insurance coverage for our products 
our current levels of insurance or any insurance we may subsequently obtain may not provide us with adequate coverage against potential claims  such as claims by those involved in accidents caused by drivers watching television 
in addition  we may be unable to renew our policies on commercially reasonable terms or obtain additional product liability insurance on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are exposed to product liability claims for which we have insufficient insurance  we may be required to pay significant damages  which could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations 
exports of certain defense products are subject to the international traffic in arms regulations and require a license from the us department of state prior to shipment 
we must comply with the united states export administration regulations and the international traffic in arms regulations  or itar 
our products that have military or strategic applications are on the munitions list of 
table of contents the itar and require an individual validated license in order to be exported to certain jurisdictions 
any changes in export regulations may further restrict the export of our products  and we may cease to be able to procure export licenses for our products under existing regulations 
the length of time required by the licensing process can vary  potentially delaying the shipment of products and the recognition of the corresponding revenue 
any restriction on the export of a significant product line or a significant amount of our products could cause a significant reduction in net sales 
our business may suffer if we cannot protect our proprietary technology 
our ability to compete depends significantly upon our patents  our source code and our other proprietary technology 
the steps we have taken to protect our technology may be inadequate to prevent others from using what we regard as our technology to compete with us 
our patents could be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and the rights we have under our patents could provide no competitive advantages 
existing trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws offer only limited protection 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary technology to the same extent as the laws of the united states  which could increase the likelihood of misappropriation 
furthermore  other companies could independently develop similar or superior technology without violating our intellectual property rights 
any misappropriation of our technology or the development of competing technology could seriously harm our competitive position  which could lead to a substantial reduction in net sales 
if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights  the proceedings could be burdensome  disruptive and expensive  distract the attention of management  and there can be no assurance that we would prevail 
also  we have delivered certain technical data and information to the us government under procurement contracts  and it may have unlimited rights to use that technical data and information 
there can be no assurance that the us government will not authorize others to use that data and information to compete with us 
pending securities class action lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we and certain of our officers are defendants in a putative class action lawsuit in the u 
s 
district court for the district of rhode island 
the suit asserts claims under sections b and a of the securities exchange act of and rule b thereunder  as well as claims under sections  a and under the securities act of  on behalf of purchasers of our securities between october  and july  we and certain of our directors and officers are also defendants in a putative shareholders derivative action on the business calendar of the superior court for providence county 
this suit asserts state law claims on our behalf between october  and the present arising from the allegations set forth in the class action complaints in the us district court described above 
we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will not have to pay significant damages or amounts in settlement 
an unfavorable outcome or prolonged litigation could materially harm our business 
litigation of this nature is expensive and time consuming and diverts the time and attention of our management 
claims by others that we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business and financial condition 
our industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents  patents that may be issued in the future  or other intellectual property rights of others 
we do not generally conduct exhaustive patent searches to determine whether the technology used in our products infringes patents held by third parties 
in addition  product development is inherently uncertain in a 
table of contents rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending  many of which are confidential when filed  with regard to similar technologies 
from time to time we have faced claims by third parties that our products or technology infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights  and we may face similar claims in the future 
any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim  even if the claim is invalid  and could distract the attention of our management 
if any of our products are found to violate third party proprietary rights  we may be required to pay substantial damages 
in addition  we may be required to re engineer our products or obtain licenses from third parties to continue to offer our products 
any efforts to re engineer our products or obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms may not be successful  which would prevent us from selling our products  and  in any case  could substantially increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may require additional financing  which may be difficult to obtain 
in the future we may require additional capital to fund our operations  carry out our business strategy  and sustain our business 
for example  we may require funds to expand manufacturing operations to meet additional demand for our mobile satellite communications products  and we may need additional funds to promote new products  including our tracvision a product 
our existing and anticipated sources of capital may be insufficient for our needs  and we may be unable to access additional capital when needed 
our future capital requirements will depend upon customer demand  competitive conditions  regulatory and technological developments  magnitude and variability of our revenue  and equipment costs and other costs associated with the development and manufacture of our products 
we may be unable to obtain additional capital on terms that are favorable or even acceptable to us 
any failure to raise capital as needed may require us to delay or abandon marketing  product development and other plans 
fluctuations in our quarterly net sales and results of operations could depress the market price of our common stock 
we have experienced significant fluctuations in our net sales and results of operations from one quarter to the next 
our future net sales and results of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
accordingly  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of future performance 
it is possible that our net sales or results of operations in a quarter will fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the market price of our common stock could fall significantly 
our results of operations in any quarter can fluctuate for many reasons  including demand changes for our mobile satellite communications products and defense products  the timing and size of individual orders from military customers  our ability to manufacture  test and deliver products in a timely and cost effective manner  our success in winning competitions for orders  the timing of new product introductions by us or our competitors  the mix of products we sell  market and competitive pricing pressures  general economic climate  and seasonality of pleasure boat and recreational vehicle usage 
a large portion of our expenses  including expenses for facilities  equipment  and personnel  are relatively fixed 
accordingly  if our net sales decline or do not grow as much as we anticipate  we might be unable to 
table of contents maintain or improve our operating margins 
any failure to achieve anticipated net sales could therefore significantly harm our operating results for a particular fiscal period 
our tax planning strategy involves assumptions that may cause our annual provision for tax expense or benefit to fluctuate materially 
moreover  our tax planning strategy is based upon our ability to sell and lease back our manufacturing and corporate headquarters facility located in middletown  rhode island  as may be necessary 
we utilize a tax planning strategy as provided for under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states as a means of supporting the realizable nature of our deferred tax assets 
the strategy involves our ability to sell and lease back our middletown  rhode island headquarters facility in order to generate taxable income for the sole purpose of utilizing our capitalized tax loss carryforwards before they expire 
the determination of taxable income  and therefore supportable deferred tax asset value  is based upon the difference between the property s estimated fair market value and our tax basis  less an adjustment for strategy implementation costs 
accordingly  the estimated net realizable value of our deferred tax asset is highly correlated to property values in and around the middletown  rhode island area and therefore subject to changes in property value 
this fair market value subjectivity may cause us to record significant increases or decreases to our deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of each year  since we have historically evaluated our deferred tax asset during that period 
the strategy represents an action that we ordinarily would not take  but could take  if necessary  to realize an estimated million in us deferred tax assets or the equivalent of approximately million in estimated net taxable income as of december  changes in the securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs 
as a result of the sarbanes oxley act of  the sec and the nasdaq have promulgated a variety of new rules and listing standards 
compliance with these new rules and listing standards has significantly increased our legal  financial and accounting costs  and we expect these increased costs to continue 
these developments may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance 
likewise  these developments may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  particularly independent directors  or qualified executive officers 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile 
our stock price has been volatile 
from january  to march   the trading price of our common stock ranged from to 
many factors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate  including variations in our quarterly results of operations  the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  changing needs of military customers  changes in estimates of our performance or recommendations by securities analysts  the hiring or departure of key personnel  acquisitions or strategic alliances involving us or our competitors  changes in  or adoptions of  accounting principles  market conditions in our industries  and the global macroeconomic and geopolitical environment 

table of contents in addition  the stock market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
when the market price of a company s stock drops significantly  stockholders often institute securities class action litigation against that company 
we are now defending a securities class action lawsuit 
this pending litigation is causing us to incur substantial costs and is diverting the time and attention of our management 
these adverse consequences may continue until this action is finally resolved 
any similar litigation in the future could have similar consequences 
acquisitions may disrupt our operations or adversely affect our results 
we evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities to acquire other businesses as they arise 
the expenses we incur evaluating and pursuing acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if we acquire a business  we may be unable to manage it profitably or successfully integrate its operations with our own 
moreover  we may be unable to realize the financial  operational  and other benefits we anticipate from any acquisition 
competition for acquisition opportunities could increase the price we pay for businesses we acquire and could reduce the number of potential acquisition targets 
further  acquisitions may involve a number of special financial and business risks  such as charges related to any potential acquisition from which we may withdraw  diversion of our management s time  attention  and resources  loss of key acquired personnel  increased costs to improve or coordinate managerial  operational  financial  and administrative systems including compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  dilutive issuances of equity securities  the assumption of legal liabilities  amortization of acquired intangible assets  and potential write offs related to the impairment of goodwill 
our charter and by laws and delaware law may deter takeovers 
our certificate of incorporation  by laws and delaware law contain provisions that could have an anti takeover effect and discourage  delay or prevent a change in control or an acquisition that many stockholders may find attractive 
these provisions may also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to take some corporate actions  including the election of directors 
these provisions relate to the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock  and determine its terms  without a stockholder vote  the classification of our board of directors  which effectively prevents stockholders from electing a majority of the directors at any one annual meeting of stockholders  the limitation that directors may be removed only for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of two thirds of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote  the prohibition against stockholder actions by written consent  the inability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders  and advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our primary market risk exposure is in the area of foreign currency exchange risk 
we are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our subsidiary operations in denmark 
certain functions in denmark are transacted in the danish krone or euro  yet reported in the us dollar  the functional currency 
for foreign currency exposures existing at december   a unfavorable movement in the foreign exchange rates for our subsidiary location would not expose us to material losses in earnings or cash flows 
from time to time  we purchase foreign currency forward exchange contracts generally having durations of no more than months 
these forward exchange contracts are intended to offset the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany payments due from our foreign subsidiary 
forward exchange contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value until executed 
changes in the fair value are recognized in earnings 
as of december   there were no outstanding forward contracts 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and maintain liquidity  while at the same time maximize income 
we have not entered into any instruments for trading purposes 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  investment grade auction rate notes  money market funds and government  government agency and non government debt securities 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december  however  due to the conservative nature of our investments  the relatively short duration of their maturities  our ability to either convert some or all of our long term investments to less interest rate sensitive holdings or hold most securities until maturity  we believe interest rate risk is mitigated 
as of december   approximately of the million classified as available for sale marketable securities will mature or reset within one year 
we do not invest in any financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  interest rate risk is not considered material 
to the extent that we borrow against our variable rate credit facility  we will be subject to interest rate risk 
there were no borrowings outstanding at december
