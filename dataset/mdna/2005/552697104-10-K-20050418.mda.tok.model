mdc manages the business by monitoring several financial and non financial performance indicators 
the key indicators that we review focus on the areas of revenues and operating expenses 
revenue growth is analyzed by reviewing the components and mix of the growth  including growth by major geographic location  existing growth by major marketing discipline  growth from currency changes  growth from acquisition  and growth from our existing clients 
the company operates in two business segments marketing communications mdc partners is one of the world s leading marketing communications firms 
management s ongoing strategy is to acquire ownership stakes in well managed businesses with strong reputations in the industry  using its perpetual partnership model to create financial incentives and retain key personnel 
through these partners  mdc provides advertising and specialized communication services to leading clients throughout the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
these businesses provide communications services to similar types of clients on a global  national and regional basis 
the businesses have similar cost structures and are subject to the same general economic and competitive risks 
globally  during the past few years  the overall industry has continued to be affected by geopolitical unrest  lagging economic conditions  lack of consumer confidence and cautious client spending 
all of these factors contributed to a difficult business environment and industry wide margin contraction 
during this period we have continued to invest in our businesses and our personnel  and have taken action to reduce costs at some of our agencies to deal with the changing economic circumstances 
as a result of increased incentive compensation costs  increased professional fees and increased amortization of other intangible assets  our operating margins were lower in and in the marketing communications operating segment earns revenue from agency arrangements in the form of retainer fees or commissions  from short term project arrangements in the form of fixed fees or per diem fees for services  and from incentives or bonuses 
additional information about revenue recognition appears in the notes to the consolidated financial statements

mdc marketing communications segment measures operating expenses in two distinct cost categories  cost of services sold  and office and general expenses 
cost of services sold is primarily comprised of employee compensation related costs and direct costs related primarily to production 
office and general expenses are primarily comprised of rent and occupancy costs and administrative service costs including related employee compensation costs 
each of our agencies requires service professionals with a skill set that is common across our disciplines 
the office space requirements of our agencies are similar across geographies and disciplines  and their technology requirements are generally limited to personal computers  servers and off the shelf software 
because we are a service business  we monitor these costs on a percentage of revenue basis 
cost of services sold tend to fluctuate in conjunction with changes in revenues  whereas office and general expenses  which are not directly related to servicing clients  tend to decrease as a percentage of revenue as revenues increase because a significant portion of these expenses are relatively fixed in nature 
secure products international the secure products international group provides security products and services in three primary areas electronic transaction products  such as credit  debit  telephone and smart cards  secure ticketing products  such as airline  transit and event tickets  and stamps  both postal and excise

cost of products sold is a mixture of direct labour and direct material costs 
material costs are primarily paper and ink 
office and general expenses are primarily comprised of rent and occupancy costs and administrative service costs including related employee compensation costs 
each product within the secure products international group requires unique security development  production  and finishing characteristics 
the core value is the ability of mdc to deliver  achieve and maintain the trust clients place in the company to develop  produce  and finish products securely and accurately 
the facilities are generally segregated into a secure production facility  finishing area  and office  general and administration 
because of the nature of the products we produce  which require a combination of production and services  we monitor direct costs as a percentage of revenue 
there is a material portion of our costs which are fixed in nature  and therefore income can fluctuate as the production levels and timing of deliveries fluctuates 
secure products international revenues totaled million in  compared to million in the prior year  after excluding million of revenues attributable to the custom direct operations that were divested in the second quarter of on the same basis  operating profit in was million  representing a substantial improvement over the operating loss of million in the prior year  which excludes million of operating income relating to divested operations

these acquired operations contributed million of revenue on a combined basis during the year 
excluding the revenue derived from these acquisitions in  combined revenues increased period over period 
additionally  a weakening of the us dollar throughout as compared to resulted in increased contributions from the division s canadian and uk based operations by approximately million 
excluding the effects of both acquisitions and foreign exchange rate changes  combined revenues improved by approximately in compared to  reflecting the significant organic revenue growth in the us businesses 
the growth in us combined revenues was driven by incremental revenues resulting from crispin porter bogusky  llc s cpb significant new client  increased transaction volumes at accent marketing services and source marketing s significant direct marketing projects this year 
fletcher martin ewing s diminished revenues  as well as lower revenue at mackenzie marketing due to reduced client spending  mitigated this substantial growth 
the positive organic growth  particularly in revenues from us operations  combined with acquisitions  resulted in a shift in the geographic mix of combined revenues  which is demonstrated in the following table combined revenue us canada uk during  the company s client base composition shifted in several areas as compared to the company saw a relative increase in spending by retail based clients  while consumer product and automotive based client revenues decreased as a percentage of combined revenue in as compared to in dollar terms  significant increases were noted in revenues from consumer product  telecommunications and retail based clients

a continuation of the nhl lockout will further adversely affect revenue in operating expenses operating expenses were million during versus million in the previous year 
excluding the impact of disposed operations  and after adjusting the results for the second quarter impairment charges related to goodwill and fixed assets described below  operating expenses increased million 
primarily as a result of higher production volumes at ashton potter  which related to the usps contract  and at placard  cost of goods sold increased by million and salaries and related costs  included in office and general expenses  increased million 
severance and other related costs incurred by metaca were million higher than in the previous year principally due to an initiative undertaken to re align the cost structure of the business in response to declining revenues

consolidated revenue on a consolidated basis  revenue increased million  or  to million in compared to revenue of million in as previously discussed  this increase related primarily to acquisitions excluding those accounted for on an equity basis in the marketing communications group  together with the consolidation of cpb from september  as a result of amendments to the credit facility  and organic growth partially offset by the effect of the divestiture of cdi in by the secure products international group 
operating expenses consolidated operating expenses increased million to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  operating costs were in compared to in after adjusting for the write down of fixed assets and goodwill charges recorded in the increase is largely due to the impact of the increased costs incurred at corporate and other operations as a result of the factors described above and the effect of dispositions 
operating costs as a percentage of revenue for the marketing communications group increased slightly from in to in in accordance with sfas  business combinations  the company was required to analyze the value paid for each entity acquired during and allocate the purchase price to both tangible and intangible assets 
intangible assets include both goodwill and non goodwill intangible assets 
beginning in  goodwill is not amortized  but instead  is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis 
intangible assets that arise from contractual or other legal rights regardless of whether those rights are transferable or separable from the acquired entity or from other rights and obligations or are separable ie capable of being separated and sold  rented  transferred  licensed  or exchanged  regardless of whether or not there is intent to do so must be recognized apart from goodwill 
as a result of the review of acquired entities during  the company identified million of non goodwill intangible assets 
these assets primarily include customer relationships and contracts  certain employee agreements and internally developed software 
of this amount  million related to certain trademarks and trade names that are not amortizable as it has determined that the useful lives of these assets are indefinite 
the remaining million of amortizable intangible assets have been assigned a weighted average useful life of years 
during  amortization expense related to intangible and other assets was million 
this expense represents only partial year charges as the assets were acquired as various times during amortization expense for and beyond is expected to be significantly higher than that experienced during as a result of changes in the relationship between the company and crispin porter bogusky cpb  effective september  the company became the primary beneficiary of cpb and is required to consolidate its operations under fin r 
as a result of this change in accounting  the company was required to obtain a fair market valuation of cpb and record assets  including goodwill and non goodwill intangibles  and liabilities of cpb based on their fair value as of september  this resulted in the company recording million of intangible assets and goodwill  of which are amortizable 
since september  amortization expense related to these intangibles was million 
the company will continue to recognize amortization expense on the full value of the intangible assets at cpb  despite continuing to realize of the income generated by the business based on its economic ownership 
operating profit as a result of the above  the company achieved operating profit of million in representing an million improvement from the operating loss of million incurred in an improvement of million in the operating profits of the marketing communications group and an improvement million in the secure products international group was partially offset by the increase in the operating loss attributable to corporate and other operations primarily relating to increased office and general expenses as described above 
gain on sale of assets and settlement of long term debt on a consolidated basis  the gain on sale of assets and settlement of long term debt was million for and primarily related to the gain on the divestiture of the remaining interest in cdi of million  net of the loss on the settlement of the adjustable rate exchangeable securities of million and fair value adjustment for the embedded derivative in the first quarter of million 
the company also recognizes a million loss on settlement of long term debt and a million loss on sale of assets in this represented a significant decline from the million prior year gain  which related primarily to the disposition of the company s former us cheque operations 
foreign exchange loss a foreign exchange loss of million was recorded in compared to a loss of million in  due primarily to a strengthening in the canadian dollar compared to the us dollar on the us dollar denominated monetary balances of canadian subsidiaries 
at december  the exchange rate was canadian dollars to one us dollar  compared to at the end of and at the end of interest  net consolidated net interest expense incurred during amounted to million  compared to million incurred during interest expense decreased million due primarily to the repayment of the senior subordinated notes notes in and the redemption of the convertible debentures in interest income was relatively unchanged 
income from continuing operations before income taxes  equity in affiliates and minority interests the consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes  equity in affiliates and minority interests for the year was million compared to million achieved in the decrease was primarily due to the significant gain on sale of assets related to cdi in  net of goodwill charges and the write down of assets also recorded in that year

income taxes were of income from continuing operations before income taxes  equity in affiliates and minority interests versus in during  the effective tax rate was substantially lower than the statutory tax rate as a result of minority interest income and significant gains at reduced tax rates 
equity in affiliates equity in affiliates represents the income attributable to equity accounted affiliate operations 
for  income of million was recorded 
the decrease of million from the million earned in is principally due to the consolidation of cpb in the third quarter of and reduced operating results in other affiliates partially offset by greater income generated by cpb prior to its consolidation 
as a result of a change in the relationship between the company and cpb and its officers  affected by the company s credit facility entered into on september   the financial statements of cpb  a non controlled affiliate that was previously accounted for under the equity method  have been consolidated with the company s financial statements from that date as a variable interest entity

during the third quarter of  the company and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks providing for borrowings of up to million  maturing in september the credit facility 
funds from the credit facility  described more fully in note of the consolidated financial statements included in this form k combined with a related cash management program  were used to repay in full and cancel the maxxcom credit facility  the maxxcom subordinated debenture  the mdc partners inc revolving credit facility entered into in june and a subsidiary s current bank loans 
this new credit facility  in connection with the cash management program  is expected to reduce the company s aggregate borrowing costs and provide enhanced liquidity through the reduction of overall debt levels 
the company has classified the swing line component of the revolving credit facility as a current liability in accordance with eitf  balance sheet classification of borrowings outstanding under revolving credit agreement that includes both a subjective acceleration clause and a lock box arrangement 
this component is presented  as bank indebtedness on the balance sheet 
since the swing line contains a lock box arrangement that requires the cash receipts of the company to be used to repay amounts outstanding under the swing line and the credit facility is subject to subjective acceleration clauses 
management believes that no conditions have occurred that would result in subjective acceleration by the lenders  nor do they believe that any such conditions will exist over the next twelve months 
as a result of the company s failure to file on a timely basis its interim consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended september   and due to the restatement of previously filed audited annual consolidated financial statements and june  and march  unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements  the company was in violation of certain covenants under its credit facility 
on november   the company amended its credit facility  pursuant to which the lenders i extended  until december   the due date for the company to deliver to the lenders its interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the period ended september   and ii waived violation of debt covenants in respect of the potential inaccuracy of certain representations and warranties previously made by the company under the credit agreement relating to the company s previously filed financial statements 
on march   the company further amended certain of the terms and conditions of its credit facility 
pursuant to such amendments  the lenders under the credit facility agreed  among other things  to i extend the due date for the company to deliver its annual financial statements until march   ii amend the pricing grid  iii modify the company s total debt ratio  fixed charge ratio and capital expenditures covenants as at december   and iv waive any potential event of default that may have occurred as a result of the company s failure to comply with its total debt ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants 
in order to finance the zyman group acquisition  the company entered into an additional amendment to its credit facility on april  this most recent amendment provided for  among other things  i an increase in the total revolving commitments available under the credit agreement from million to million  ii permission to consummate the zyman group acquisition  iii mandatory reductions of the total revolving commitments by million on june   million on september   million on december  and million on march   iv reduced flexibility to consummate acquisitions going forward and v modification to the fixed charges ratio and total debt ratio financial covenants 
the recent amendments to the credit facility were necessary in order to avoid an event of default under the credit facility  to finance the zyman group acquisition  and to permit the company to continue to borrow under the credit facility 
the company is currently in compliance with all of the terms and conditions of its amended credit facility  and management believes that the company will be in compliance with covenants over the next twelve months 
if  however  the company loses all or a substantial portion of its lines of credit under the credit facility  or if the company were unable to borrow after giving effect to the mandatory reductions of its revolving commitments under the credit facility  it will be required to seek other sources of liquidity 
if the company were unable to find these sources of liquidity  for example through an equity offering or access to the capital markets  the company s ability to fund its working capital needs and any contingent obligations with respect to put options would be adversely affected 
disclosure of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following table provides a payment schedule of present and future obligations

capital resources at december   the company had utilized approximately million of its million facility in the form of drawings and letters of credit 
cash and undrawn available bank credit facilities to support the company s future cash requirements  at the end of  was approximately million 
the company expects to incur approximately million of capital expenditures in and million in such capital expenditures are expected to include leasehold improvements at certain of the company s operating subsidiaries 
the company intends to maintain and expand its business using cash from operating activities  together with funds available under the credit facility and  if required  by raising additional funds through the incurrence of bridge or other debt which may include or require further amendments to the credit facility or the issuance of equity 
management believes that the company s cash flow from operations and funds available under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet its ongoing capital expenditure  working capital and other cash needs over the next two years 
if the company has significant growth through acquisitions  however  management expects that the company could need to obtain additional financing 
as described previously  on april  the company increased its credit facility from million to million  with specified mandatory reductions of million through march deferred acquisition consideration earnouts acquisitions of certain businesses by the company include commitments to contingent deferred purchase consideration payable to the seller 
the contingent purchase obligations are generally payable annually over a three year period following the acquisition date  and are based on achievement of certain thresholds of future earnings and  in certain cases  also based on the rate of growth of those earnings 
the contingent consideration in recorded as an obligation of the company when the contingency is resolved and the amount is reasonably determinable 
at december   approximately million in deferred consideration relating to current and prior year acquisitions is presented on the company s balance sheet 
based on the various assumptions as to future operating results of the relevant entities  management estimates that approximately million of further additional deferred purchase obligations could be triggered during or thereafter 
the actual amount that the company pays in connection with the obligations may be materially different from this estimate 
off balance sheet commitments put rights of subsidiaries minority shareholders owners of interests in certain marketing communications subsidiaries have the right in certain circumstances to require the company to acquire the remaining ownership interests held by them 
these rights are not free standing 
the owners ability to exercise any such put right is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  including conditions requiring notice in advance of exercise 
in addition  these rights cannot be exercised prior to specified staggered exercise dates 
the exercise of these rights at their earliest contractual date would result in obligations of the company to fund the related amounts during the period to it is not determinable  at this time  if or when the owners of these rights will exercise all or a portion of these rights 
the amount payable by the company in the event such rights are exercised is dependent on various valuation formulas and on future events  such as the average earnings of the relevant subsidiary through the date of exercise  the growth rate of the earnings of the relevant subsidiary during that period  and  in some cases  the currency exchange rate at the date of payment 
management estimates  assuming that the subsidiaries perform over the relevant future periods at their earnings levels  that these rights  if all exercised  could require the company  in future periods  to pay an aggregate of approximately million to the owners of such rights to acquire the remaining ownership interests in the relevant subsidiaries 
of this amount  the company is entitled  at its option  to fund approximately million by the issuance of share capital 
if these rights were exercised in aggregate  the company would acquire incremental ownership interests in the relevant marketing communications subsidiaries  entitling the company to additional annual operating income before depreciation and amortization  which is estimated  using the same earnings basis used to determine the aggregate purchase price noted above  to be approximately million 
the ultimate amount payable and the incremental operating income in future relating to these transactions will vary because it is dependent on the future results of operations of the subject businesses and the timing of when these rights are exercised 
the actual amounts will be different from these estimates  and these differences could be material 
see forward looking statements 
the following table summarizes the potential timing of the consideration and incremental operating income before depreciation and amortization based on assumptions as described above 
consideration millions thereafter total cash shares incremental operating income before depreciation and amortization of this  approximately million has been recognized in minority interest on the company s balance sheet as of september  in conjunction with the consolidation of cpb as a variable interest entity 
see note approximately million of the estimated million that the company could be required to pay subsidiaries minority shareholders upon the exercise of outstanding put rights relates to rights exercisable in in respect of the securities of six subsidiaries 
the company expects to fund the acquisition of these interests  if and when they become due  through the use of cash derived from operations  bank borrowings and or other external sources of financing 
the acquisition of any equity interest in connection with the potential exercise of these rights in will not be recorded in the company s financial statements until ownership is transferred 
guarantees in connection with certain dispositions of assets and or businesses in and  the company has provided customary representations and warranties whose terms range in duration and may not be explicitly defined 
the company has also retained certain liabilities for events occurring prior to sale  relating to tax  environmental  litigation and other matters 
generally  the company has indemnified the purchasers in the event that a third party asserts a claim against the purchaser that relates to a liability retained by the company 
these types of indemnification guarantees typically extend for several years 
in connection with the sale of the company s investment in cdi  the amounts of indemnification guarantees are limited to the total sale price of approximately million 
for the remainder  the company s potential liability for these indemnifications are not subject to a limit as the underlying agreements do not always specify a maximum amount and the amounts are dependent upon the outcome of future contingent events 
historically  the company has not made any significant indemnification payments under such agreements and no provision has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification guarantees 
the company continues to monitor the conditions that are subject to guarantees and indemnifications to identify whether it is probable that a loss has occurred  and would recognize any such losses under any guarantees or indemnifications in the period when those losses are probable and estimable 
for guarantees and indemnifications entered into after january   in connection with the sale of the company s investment in cdi  the company has estimated the fair value of its liability  which was insignificant  and included such amount in the determination of the gain or loss on the sale of the business

differences in md a presentation under canadian gaap under canadian securities requirements  the company is required to provide supplemental information to highlight the significant differences that would have resulted in the information provided in the md a had the company prepared the md a using canadian gaap financial information 
the company has identified and disclosed the significant differences between canadian and us gaap as applied to its consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the primary gaap difference impacting the components of operating profit loss is the application under canadian gaap of proportionate consolidation for investments in joint ventures  while us gaap requires equity accounting for such investments  and the treatment of certain foreign exchange gains and loses on the repayment of certain intercompany loans 
this gaap difference does not have a significant impact on the content of the md a as the discussion of the results of the company s marketing communications businesses has been presented on a combined basis  consistent with the company s segment disclosures in its consolidated financial statements 
the combined financial information has been reconciled to us gaap financial information by adjusting for the equity accounting for certain joint ventures in this md a as well as in the segment information in note to the consolidated financial statements 
if the reconciliation of the combined financial information were prepared to reconcile to canadian gaap results  it would have to be adjusted for the proportionate consolidation of the joint ventures 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following summary of accounting policies has been prepared to assist in better understanding the company s consolidated financial statements and the related management discussion and analysis 
readers are encouraged to consider this information together with the company s consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete understanding of accounting policies discussed below 
estimates 
the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  or gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities including goodwill  intangible assets  valuation allowances for receivables and deferred income tax assets  stock based compensation  and the reporting of variable interest entities at the date of the financial statements 
the statements are evaluated on an ongoing basis and estimates are based on historical experience  current conditions and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results can differ from those estimates  and it is possible that the differences could be material 
revenue recognition 
the company generates services revenue from its marketing communications segment and product revenue from its secure products international segment 
marketing communications the marketing communications operating segment earns revenue from agency arrangements in the form of retainer fees or commissions  from short term project arrangements in the form of fixed fees or per diem fees for services  and from incentives or bonuses 
non refundable retainer fees are generally recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the specific customer contract 
commission revenue is earned and recognized upon the placement of advertisements in various media when the company has no further performance obligations 
fixed fees for services are recognized upon completion of the earnings process and acceptance by the client 
per diem fees are recognized upon the performance of the company s services 
fees billed to clients in excess of fees recognized as revenue are classified as deferred revenue 
a small portion of the company s contractual arrangements with clients includes performance incentive provisions  which allow the company to earn additional revenues as a result of its performance relative to both quantitative and qualitative goals 
the company recognizes the incentive portion of revenue under these arrangements when specific quantitative goals are achieved  or when the company s clients determine performance against qualitative goals has been achieved 
in all circumstances  revenue is only recognized when collection is reasonably assured 
secured products substantially all of the secured products international segment revenue is derived from the sale of products 
there are no warranty or product return provisions in the company s contracts that result in significant provisions 
the company has the following revenue recognition policies 
revenue derived from the stamp operations is recognized upon shipment or upon delivery of the product to the customer when the company s obligations under the contractual arrangements are completed  the customer takes ownership and assumes the risk of loss of the product  the selling price is determinable and the collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
the company performs quality control testing procedures prior to shipment to ensure that its contractual obligations are met 
under these contractual arrangements  the company has the ability to recover any costs incurred prior to shipment in the event of contract termination accordingly the company accounts for the manufacturing costs incurred as inventory work in process  prior to completion of production 
revenue derived from secured printing arrangements whereby the company manufactures and stores the printed product for a period of time at the direction of its customer with delivery at a future date within a day period is accounted for on a bill and hold basis whereby the company allocates the arrangement consideration on a relative fair value basis between the printing service and the storage service 
the company recognizes the printing revenue when the customized printed products moves to the secure storage facility and the printing process is complete and when title transfers to the customer 
the company has no further obligations under the printing segment of the arrangement 
the company recognizes the storage fee revenue on a straight line basis over the period to product delivery 
although amounts are generally not billed by the company until the customized print product is delivered to the customer s premises  collection of the entire consideration is due under certain contracts within days of completion of the printing segment of the arrangement and is not dependent on delivery 
for other contracts where payment is dependent on delivery  revenue is recognized upon delivery to the customer s premises and when other criteria for revenue recognition are met 
revenue derived from the design  manufacturing  inventory management and personalization of secured cards is recognized as a single unit of accounting when the secured card is shipped to the cardholder  the company s service obligations to the card issuer are complete under the terms of the contractual arrangement  the total selling price related to the card is known and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
any amounts billed and or collected in advance of this date are deferred and recognized at the shipping date 
under these contractual arrangements  the company has the ability to recover any costs incurred prior to shipping in the event of contract termination and accordingly the company accounts for the costs incurred related to design and manufacturing as inventory work in process 
the company s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with the sec staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition sab 
sab summarizes certain of the sec staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
also  in july  the eitf of the financial accounting standards board released issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf 
this issue summarized the eitf s views on when revenue should be recorded at the gross amount billed because it has earned revenue from the sale of goods or services  or the net amount retained because it has earned a fee or commission 
in the marketing communications businesses  it acts as an agent and records revenue equal to the net amount retained  when the fee or commission is earned 
acquisitions  goodwill and other intangibles 
a fair value approach is used in testing goodwill for impairment under sfas to determine if an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
one approach utilized to determine fair values is a discounted cash flow methodology 
when available and as appropriate  comparative market multiples are used 
numerous estimates and assumptions necessarily have to be made when completing a discounted cash flow valuation  including estimates and assumptions regarding interest rates  appropriate discount rates and capital structure 
additionally  estimates must be made regarding revenue growth  operating margins  tax rates  working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
estimates and assumptions also need to be made when determining the appropriate comparative market multiples to be used 
actual results of operations  cash flows and other factors used in a discounted cash flow valuation will likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences and changes could be material 
no impairment charge was recognized in while such charges recognized in and were and  respectively 
additional information about impairment testing under sfas appears in the notes of the consolidated financial statements 
the company has historically made and expects to continue to make selective acquisitions of marketing communications businesses 
in making acquisitions  the price paid is determined by various factors  including service offerings  competitive position  reputation and geographic coverage  as well as prior experience and judgment 
due to the nature of advertising  marketing and corporate communications services companies  the companies acquired frequently have significant identifiable intangible assets which primarily consist of customer relationships 
the company has determined that certain intangibles trademarks have an indefinite life as there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  or economic factors that limit the useful life 
a summary of the company s deferred acquisition consideration obligations  sometimes referred to as earnouts  and obligations under put rights of subsidiaries minority shareholders to purchase additional interests in certain subsidiary and affiliate companies is set forth in the liquidity and capital resources section of this report 
the deferred acquisition consideration obligations and obligations to purchase additional interests in certain subsidiary and affiliate companies are primarily based on future performance 
contingent purchase price obligations are accrued  in accordance with gaap  when the contingency is resolved and payment is determinable 
additional information about acquisitions and goodwill appears in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this report 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
trade receivables are stated less allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance represents estimated uncollectible receivables usually due to customers potential insolvency 
the allowance included amounts for certain customers where risk of default has been specifically identified 
income tax valuation allowance 
the company records a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets when management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
management considers factors such as the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  the character of the income tax asset  tax planning strategies  changes in tax laws and other factors 
a change to these factors could impact the estimated valuation allowance and income tax expense 
during  this allowance increased million as a result of increased unrecognized tax loss benefits 
stock based compensation 
effective january   the company prospectively adopted fair value accounting for stock based awards as prescribed by sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
prior to january   the company elected not to apply fair value accounting to stock based awards to employees  other than for direct awards of stock and awards settleable in cash  which required fair value accounting 
prior to january   for awards not elected to be accounted for under the fair value method  the company accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
apb is based upon an intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
under this method  compensation cost is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the stock issuance at the measurement date over the amount to be paid by the employee 
the company adopted fair value accounting for stock based awards using the prospective method available under the transitional provisions of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
accordingly  the fair value method is applied to all awards granted  modified or settled on or after january  under the fair value method  compensation cost is measured at fair value at the date of grant and is expensed over the service period  that is the award s vesting period 
when awards are exercised  share capital is credited by the sum of the consideration paid together with the related portion previously credited to additional paid in capital when compensation costs were charged against income or acquisition consideration 
stock based awards that are settled in cash or may be settled in cash at the option of employees are recorded as liabilities 
the measurement of the liability and compensation cost for these awards is based on the intrinsic value of the award  and is recorded into operating income over the service period  that is the vesting period of the award 
changes in the company s payment obligation subsequent to vesting of the award and prior to the settlement date are recorded as compensation cost over the service period in operating income 
the final payment amount for share appreciation rights is established on the date of the exercise of the award by the employee 
variable interest entities 
the company evaluates its various investments in entities to determine whether the investee is a variable interest entity and if so whether mdc is the primary beneficiary 
such evaluation requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk in the investee and the expected losses of the investee and may impact whether the investee is accounted for on a consolidated basis 
new accounting pronouncements the following recent pronouncements were issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb adopted in consolidation of variable interest entities in january  the fasb issued interpretation no

other than temporary impairment in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf 
eitf established additional disclosure requirements for each category of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas  investments in a loss position 
effective for years ended after december   the adoption of this eitf requires the company to include certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures for debt and marketable equity securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity under sfas that are impaired at the balance sheet date for which an other than temporary impairment has not been recognized
