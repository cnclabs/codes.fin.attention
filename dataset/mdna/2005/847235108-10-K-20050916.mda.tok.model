information provided at the website includes  among other items  the annual report on form k  quarterly reports on form q  quarterly earnings releases  news releases  and the code of ethics  as well as various corporate charters 
the company s operations are in one line of business  electronic contract manufacturing services ems 
sparton s capabilities range from product design and development through aftermarket support  specializing in total business solutions for government  medical scientific instrumentation  aerospace and industrial markets 
this includes the design  development and or manufacture of electronic parts and assemblies for both government and commercial customers worldwide 
governmental sales are mainly sonobuoys 
the private securities litigation reform act of reflects congress determination that the disclosure of forward looking information is desirable for investors and encourages such disclosure by providing a safe harbor for forward looking statements by corporate management 
this report on form k contains forward looking statements within the scope of the securities act of and the securities exchange act of the words expects  anticipates  believes  intends  plans  and similar expressions  and the negatives of such expressions  are intended to identify forward looking statements 
in addition  any statements which refer to expectations  projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly disclose any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring subsequent to filing this form k with the securities and exchange commission sec 
these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  those discussed below 
accordingly  sparton s future results may differ materially from historical results or from those discussed or implied by these forward looking statements 
the company notes that a variety of factors could cause the actual results and experience to differ materially from anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements 
sparton  as a high mix  low to medium volume supplier  provides rapid product turnaround for customers 
high mix describes customers needing multiple product types with generally low volume manufacturing runs 
as a contract manufacturer with customers in a variety of markets  the company has substantially less visibility of end user demand and  therefore  forecasting sales can be problematic 
customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities and or reschedule production for a number of reasons 
depressed economic conditions may result in customers delaying delivery of product  or the placement of purchase orders for lower volumes than previously anticipated 
unplanned cancellations  reductions  or delays by customers may negatively impact the company s results of operations 
as many of the company s costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed within given ranges of production  a reduction in customer demand can disproportionately affect the company s gross margins and operating income 
the majority of the company s sales have historically come from a limited number of customers 
significant reductions in sales to  or a loss of  one of these customers could materially impact business if the company were not able to replace those sales with new business 
other risks and uncertainties that may affect operations  performance  growth forecasts and business results include  but are not limited to  timing and fluctuations in us and or world economies  competition in the overall ems business  availability of production labor and management services under terms acceptable to the company  congressional budget outlays for sonobuoy development and production  congressional legislation  foreign currency exchange rate risk  uncertainties associated with the costs and benefits of new facilities and the closing of others  uncertainties associated with the outcome of litigation  changes in the interpretation of environmental laws  the uncertainties of environmental remediation  and uncertainties relating to defects discovered in certain of the company s aerospace circuit boards 
a further risk factor is the availability and cost of materials 
the company has encountered availability and extended lead time issues on some electronic components in the past when market demand has been strong  which have resulted in higher prices and late deliveries 
additionally  the timing of sonobuoy sales to the us navy is dependent upon access to  and successful passage of  product tests performed by the us navy 
reduced governmental budgets have made access to the test range less predictable and less frequent than in the past 
finally  the sarbanes oxley act of has required changes in  and formalization of  some of the company s corporate governance and compliance practices 
the sec and new york stock exchange have also passed new rules and regulations requiring additional compliance activities 
compliance with these rules has increased administrative costs  and it is expected that certain of these costs will continue indefinitely 
management cautions readers not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which are subject to influence by the enumerated risk factors as well as unanticipated future events 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal sales of total sales of total change government industrial other aerospace medical scientific instrumentation totals sales for the year ended june   totaled  an increase of  from fiscal government sales decreased  and included million of a delayed sonobuoy sale originally anticipated to ship in fiscal rescheduling of engineering redesign work  failed sonobuoy drop tests  and lack of access to the us navy s test site contributed to the depressed government sales 
the company does not anticipate the level of government sales to continue to decline 
industrial and other market sales  which include gaming sales  increased from the same period last year 
this increase was attributed to increased demand from two existing customers  and it is uncertain if this increased demand will continue into the next fiscal year 
sales to the aerospace markets continue to grow  increasing over the prior year 
in general  this reflects stronger demand in the commercial aerospace market  primarily increased demand for products related to aircraft collision avoidance systems mandated for installation in all commercial aircraft 
this increased level of sales of collision avoidance products is not anticipated to continue 
approximately million of the aerospace increase was attributable to increased orders from one customer  to which the company supplies product to six separate manufacturing facilities 
medical scientific instrumentation sales declined from the prior year 
this decrease resulted from overall lower demand from existing customers in this market area  as well as new program delays 
while the company has added several new customers  and or products in the medical device area  the volume of new business has not been as high as anticipated 
the majority of the company s sales come from a small number of customers

results sparton corporation annual report 
table of contents for the fiscal year ended were impacted by severe tropical storms in florida during the period 
while the tropical storms largely bypassed the company s two florida facilities  extensive preparations were undertaken for the predicted storms 
this unexpected activity  along with the minor damage that was experienced and unproductive wages  resulted in costs of approximately  being charged in the first quarter of fiscal  the majority of which were included in cost of goods sold 
the current year s gross profit also included a settlement with a customer in the second quarter of fiscal  which resulted in the company s recovery of  of prior period start up expenses 
the prior year s depressed margin reflects the inclusion of costs on the start up phase of several major programs  as well as final charges incurred at the completion of one sonobuoy contract that had experienced technical problems 
in addition  the prior year s margin included a redesign effort on an existing product line  which resulted in a charge to operations of  gross margin was further reduced in and by charges of  and  respectively  for obsolete inventory at two locations 
the company continues to experience underutilized capacity which  due to the fixed nature of many of the company s costs  continues to negatively impact margins 
finally  pension costs decreased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this decrease in pension costs was due to an increase in the expected return on pension assets and reduced amortization costs related to unrecognized actuarial losses 
the majority of pension costs are charged to cost of goods sold 
spartronics vietnam officially began operations in may included in fiscal results were the operations from the company s new vietnam facility  which startup adversely impacted gross margin by  these results are not expected to continue  as fiscal will reflect a full year of sales and a reduction in startup related costs 
the lowered selling and administrative expenses are primarily the result of decreased bid and proposal and research and development expenses for fiscal  which were approximately million below the same period last year 
these cost reductions are not indicative of reduced bid and proposal activity  but primarily the result of a one time sonobuoy engineering project in fiscal which has been completed 
operating income also includes charges related to the new mexico environmental remediation effort  principally legal fees  of  in fiscal and  in fiscal in addition  fiscal includes  pre tax of income related to the company s settlement with previous insurance carriers  which reflects a recovery of a portion of past costs the company incurred in its investigation and site remediation of its coors road facility 
these epa charges and income are more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item net gain on sale of property  plant and equipment in fiscal includes a gain of  on the sale of a warehouse in deleon springs  florida 
fiscal includes a gain of  related to the disposal of the rio rancho plant  which was replaced by the current albuquerque  new mexico facility 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company also settled negotiations with a canadian customer for past costs and inventory 
this settlement resulted in the receipt of approximately million cash  with a loss recognized of approximately  most of this inventory had previously been carried as a long term asset in the company s balance sheet 
interest and investment income increased  to  in fiscal this increase was due to increased funds available for investment and improved investment rates 
investment securities are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item other income expense net was  and  in fiscal and  respectively

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal sales of total sales of total change government industrial other aerospace medical scientific instrumentation totals sales for the year ended june   totaled  a decrease of  from fiscal overall  sales remained below original expectations given the continued depressed economic markets that our customers serve 
all markets declined with the exception of aerospace 
the decline in government sales was mainly due to a decline in foreign demand  including one delayed foreign sonobuoy sale of million  which due to unforeseen shipping complications did not occur until july prior year s sales in the industrial market benefited from strong demand for homeland security products  principally driven by the demand for chemical trace detection equipment in both the us and canadian airports 
these sales totaled approximately million in fiscal compared to million last year 
this decline in the industrial market was partially offset by increased sales to other customers 
the increase in aerospace sales was primarily due to increased sales to one existing customer  this customer has shown consistent growth over past years 
the following table presents consolidated income statement data as a percentage of net sales for the years ended june  and  respectively 
net sales costs of goods sold gross profit selling and administrative epa related income expense net environmental remediation net gain on sale of property  plant and equipment operating income loss interest and investment income equity income loss in investment other income expense net income loss before income taxes provision credit for income taxes net income loss an operating loss of  and an operating profit  were reported for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
fiscal s gross margin declined to 
margins on government programs improved as the company concluded production of several problem plagued sonobuoy contracts during however  an engineering redesign on an existing proprietary product line in resulted in charges of  of which  occurred during the first quarter of gross margin was further reduced in the fourth quarter of by a charge of  for obsolete inventory at two locations 
the inventory involved was previously used in the production of certain proprietary products 
based upon the recent evaluation of these products  and their decreased demand and changes in product specifications  the inventory was deemed excess or obsolete 
in addition  pension costs increased due to a lower than expected return on pension assets  and a current year amortization charge relating to the plan s unrecognized actuarial loss which had substantially increased over the prior two years 
the majority of pension costs   in and  in  were charged to cost of goods sold 
finally  several programs were in start up mode during and contributed minimal or negative margins 
given the on going reduced level of sales  the company continued to experience underutilized capacity  which due to the fixed nature of many of the company s costs continued to negatively impact margins 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in and in increased slightly from as the company increased research and development activities primarily related to government contracts 
unreimbursed research and development sparton corporation annual report 
table of contents expenses  which are included in selling and administrative expenses as they were not customer funded  totaled  for the year ended june   compared to  for the prior year 
this increased level is not anticipated to continue 
the r d performed related to new technology for the company s sonobuoy business and is now complete 
included in operating income was the  recovery  net of tax of certain remediation costs negotiated that year 
it reflects sparton s settlement with the doe and others regarding reimbursement of costs incurred at the company s sparton technology coors road facility 
operating income also includes charges related to the new mexico environmental remediation effort  principally litigation  of  in fiscal and  in fiscal these epa charges are more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item finally   of income was included in as gain on sale related to the disposal of the rio rancho facility 
interest and investment income increased  to  in investment securities are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item other income expense net was  and  in and  respectively 
other net includes  and  of costs related to an insurance adjustment for the company s previously owned automotive segment in and  respectively

other net in included  of net transaction and translation gains 
equity investment income was  in fiscal  compared to a loss of  in the company s investment in cybernet systems corporation cybernet represents a ownership interest  which was acquired in june the company s effective tax rate credit for fiscal was  compared to the statutory us federal tax rate of 
the favorable tax rate credit was principally attributable to utilization of a net operating loss carryover related to the company s canadian facility 
because a valuation allowance was previously recorded for of the canadian facility s net operating loss carryover  no income tax expense was reflected relating to its fiscal pre tax income 
this increased the effective tax rate credit by 
with this change in the effective tax rate  a tax credit of  was recognized in the fourth quarter 
the tax credit of  included an approximately  credit reflecting the change in effective tax rates on results through the third quarter and  of expense attributable to the profits of the fourth quarter 
the effective tax rate used in earlier periods of fiscal was based on assumptions regarding activity that was anticipated to occur in the fourth quarter  which did not materialize 
in addition  the significant impact from the higher than expected canadian facility s profitability was not anticipated 
the combination of these two factors in the fourth quarter  and the final tax provision calculation  greatly affected the final tax benefit in the fourth quarter in a manner not previously anticipated 
after provision for applicable income taxes as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  the company reported a net loss of  per share  basic and diluted in fiscal  compared to net income of  per share  diluted in fiscal fiscal includes income related to the epa settlement of   net of tax 
sparton corporation annual report 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources the primary source of liquidity and capital resources has historically been from operations 
short term credit facilities have been used in the past  but not in recent years 
certain government contracts provide for interim progress billings based on costs incurred 
these progress billings reduce the amount of cash that would otherwise be required during the performance of these contracts 
as the volume of us defense related contract work declines  so has the relative importance of progress billings as a liquidity resource 
at the present time  the company plans on using its investment securities to provide working capital and to strategically invest in additional property  plant and equipment to accommodate growth 
growth is expected to be achieved through internal expansion and or acquisition or joint venture 
for the fiscal year ended june   cash and cash equivalents decreased  to  operating activities provided   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  in net cash flows 
the primary source of cash in was from operations  after reduction for the non cash income related to a legal settlement  plus the increase in accounts payable and other accruals 
partially offsetting this was an increase in accounts receivable reflecting higher government sales in june 
the legal settlement resulted in the company s recognition of  of income  the receipt of which occurred in july the primary source of cash in fiscal  which reflected a net loss  was from collection of accounts receivable  while the primary source of cash in fiscal was from operations 
the fiscal decrease in accounts receivable was reflective of the receipt of payments for the large volume of sales recognized in june the change in cash flow related to inventory and prepaid expenses from fiscal was reflective of a large increase at june   of inventory due to delayed customer delivery schedules  as well as increased inventory for new customer contracts 
inventory levels at june   reflect a decrease in inventory  as these customers schedules were no longer delayed  as well as the start of several new customer contracts 
in fiscal and the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to income taxes payable 
in fiscal  the company  due to its loss position  recognized an income tax receivable 
fiscal cash flow from operations also includes an other net reduction of  including two separate transactions 
the first  reflecting a reduction in operating cash flow  relates to a claim for an amount due of  from a vendor related to defective circuit boards  the resolution of which the company is currently pursuing with the board s manufacturer 
this amount  reflecting prior accounts receivable and inventory and associated expenses  is included in other long term assets 
the second  reflecting an increase in operating cash flow  includes a  settlement and collection from a customer for past costs and inventory which  due to the age of the claim  had been included in other long term assets 
cash flows used by investing activities totaled   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash was primarily used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment  which is discussed below  with additional amounts used to purchase investment securities 
the purchase of  and proceeds from the sale and maturities of  investment securities are generally reflective of activity within the various investment options  with the net purchases position representing the investment of excess cash generated from operations in fiscal and in fiscal  net proceeds from the sale and maturities of investments were also used to fund purchases of property  plant and equipment 
the level of purchases of property  plant and equipment experienced in fiscal and is not expected to continue 
cash flows provided by financing activities were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  primarily from the exercise of stock options 
at its august meeting  the company s board of directors approved a per share cash dividend 
the implementation of a stock repurchase program was also approved to repurchase up to million of shares of sparton stock 
the combination of these two activities should not exceed million over the next months 
historically  the company s market risk exposure to foreign currency exchange and interest rates on third party receivables and payables has not been considered to be material  principally due to their short term nature and the minimal amount of receivables and payables designated in foreign currency 
however  due to the recent strengthened canadian dollar  the impact of transaction and translation gains on intercompany activity and balances has increased 
if the exchange rate were to materially change  the company s financial position could be significantly affected 
the company has had no short term bank debt since december  and currently has an unused informal line of credit totaling million 
at june  and  the aggregate government funded ems backlog was approximately million and million  respectively 
a majority of the june   backlog is expected to be realized in the next months 
commercial ems orders are not included in the backlog 
the company does not believe the amount of commercial activity covered by firm purchase orders is a meaningful measure of future sales  as such orders may be rescheduled or cancelled without significant penalty 
construction of the company s new plant in vietnam has been completed 
prototype product has been completed and regular production began in may this new facility is anticipated to provide increased growth opportunities for the company  in current as well as new markets 
as the company has not previously done business in this emerging market  sparton corporation annual report 
table of contents there are many uncertainties and risks inherent in this venture 
to date  the company s total investment approximates million  which includes land  building  and initial operating expenses  with approximately million having been expended for the construction of the new facility  primarily in fiscal the new company operates under the name spartronics 
the company is also continuing a program of identifying and evaluating potential acquisition candidates in both the defense and medical markets 
the company purchased a manufacturing facility in albuquerque  new mexico in december for approximately million 
this facility replaced an existing plant in rio rancho  new mexico 
the costs of remodeling and facility upgrades totaled approximately million and were incurred  primarily in  as the company transitioned between facilities 
the rio rancho plant was sold in june for approximately million million after expenses related to the sale  resulting in a  gain 
the company leased the rio rancho facility until the transition to the new facility was completed in december the new facility is expected to provide economic benefits by providing higher technical capabilities and more efficient manufacturing space 
no cash dividends were declared in any of the periods presented 
in november  the company approved a stock dividend 
this dividend was distributed december   to shareowners of record on november  at june   the company had  in shareowners equity per share   in working capital  and a working capital ratio 
the company believes it has sufficient liquidity for its anticipated needs over the next months  unless a significant business acquisition is identified and completed for cash 
contractual obligations the company s current obligations  which are due within twelve months  for the payment of accounts payable  accruals  and other liabilities totaled  and includes the  current portion of the environmental liability and  of the standby letters of credit  at june  these are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets included in item the following tables summarize the company s significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of june  payments due by fiscal period contractual obligations total thereafter operating leases environmental liabilities noncancelable purchase orders total amount of commitment by fiscal expiration period other commercial commitments total thereafter standby letters of credit operating leases see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for further discussion of operating leases 
environmental liabilities see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a description of the accrual for environmental remediation 
of the  total accrued   is classified as a current liability and  is classified as a long term liability  both of which were included on the balance sheet as of june  noncancelable purchase orders orders the company has placed with suppliers that are subject to quality and performance requirements 
standby letters of credit the company has standby letters of credit outstanding aggregating approximately  at june   principally to support self insured programs and certain foreign contracts 
approximately  of the potential liabilities related to these letters of credit are reflected as accrued liabilities in the company s financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported as assets  liabilities  sparton corporation annual report 
table of contents revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies as discussed in note included to the consolidated financial statements  which is included in item  the following involve a higher degree of judgement and complexity 
environmental contingencies one of sparton s former manufacturing facilities  located in albuquerque  new mexico coors road  has been the subject of ongoing investigations and remediation efforts conducted with the environmental protection agency epa under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  sparton has accrued its estimate of the minimum future non discounted financial liability 
the estimate was developed using existing technology and excludes legal and related consulting costs 
the minimum cost estimate includes equipment  operating and monitoring costs for both onsite and offsite remediation 
sparton recognizes legal and consulting services in the periods incurred and reviews its epa accrual activity quarterly 
uncertainties associated with environmental remediation contingencies are pervasive and often result in wide ranges of reasonably possible outcomes 
it is possible that cash flows and results of operations could be materially affected by the impact of changes in these estimates 
government contract cost estimates government production contracts are accounted for based on completed units accepted with respect to revenue recognition and their estimated average cost per unit regarding costs 
losses for the entire amount of the contract are recognized in the period when such losses are determinable 
significant judgment is exercised in determining estimated total contract costs including  but not limited to  cost experience to date  estimated length of time to contract completion  costs for materials  production labor and support services to be expended  and known issues on remaining units to be completed 
estimated costs developed in the early stages of contracts can change significantly as the contracts progress  and events and activities take place 
significant changes in estimates can also occur when new designs are initially placed into production 
the company formally reviews its costs incurred to date and estimated costs to complete on all significant contracts on a quarterly basis and revised estimated total contract costs are reflected in the financial statements 
depending upon the circumstances  it is possible that the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by changes in estimated costs to complete on one or more significant contracts 
commercial inventory valuation allowances inventory valuation allowances for commercial customer inventories require a significant degree of judgment and are influenced by the company s experience to date with both customers and other markets  prevailing market conditions for raw materials  contractual terms and customers ability to satisfy these obligations  environmental or technological materials obsolescence  changes in demand for customer products  and other factors resulting in acquiring materials in excess of customer product demand 
contracts with some commercial customers may be based upon estimated quantities of product manufactured for shipment over estimated time periods 
raw material inventories are purchased to fulfill these customer requirements 
within these arrangements  customer demand for products frequently changes  sometimes creating excess and obsolete inventories 
the company regularly reviews raw material inventories by customer for both excess and obsolete quantities  with adjustments made accordingly 
wherever possible  the company attempts to recover its full cost of excess and obsolete inventories from customers or  in some cases  through other markets 
when it is determined that the company s carrying cost of such excess and obsolete inventories cannot be recovered in full  a charge is taken against income and a valuation allowance is established for the difference between the carrying cost and the estimated realizable amount 
conversely  should the disposition of adjusted excess and obsolete inventories result in recoveries in excess of these reduced carrying values  the remaining portion of the valuation allowances are reversed and taken into income when such determinations are made 
it is possible that the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by changes to inventory valuation allowances for commercial customer excess and obsolete inventories 
allowance for possible losses on receivables the accounts receivable balance is recorded net of allowances for amounts not expected to be collected from customers 
the allowance is estimated based on historical experience of write offs  the level of past due amounts  information known about specific customers with respect to their ability to make payments  and future expectations of conditions that might impact the collectibility of accounts 
accounts receivable are generally due under normal trade terms for the industry 
credit is granted  and credit evaluations are periodically performed  based on a customers financial condition and other sparton corporation annual report 
table of contents factors 
although the company does not generally require collateral  cash in advance or letters of credit may be required from customers in certain circumstances  including some foreign customers 
when management determines that it is probable that an account will not be collected  it is charged against the allowance for possible losses 
the company reviews the adequacy of its allowance monthly 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  at june  and  respectively 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
given the company s significant balance of government receivables and letters of credit from foreign customers  collection risk is considered minimal 
historically  uncollectible accounts have generally been insignificant and the minimal allowance is deemed adequate 
pension obligations the company calculates the cost of providing pension benefits under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
the key assumptions required within the provisions of sfas no 
are used in making these calculations 
the most significant of these assumptions are the discount rate used to value the future obligations and the expected return on pension plan assets 
the discount rate is consistent with market interest rates on high quality  fixed income investments 
the expected return on assets is based on long term returns and assets held by the plan  which is influenced by historical averages 
if actual interest rates and returns on plan assets materially differ from the assumptions  future adjustments to the financial statements would be required 
while changes in these assumptions can have a significant effect on the pension benefit obligation and the unrecognized gain or loss accounts disclosed in the notes to the financial statements  the effect of changes in these assumptions is not expected to have the same relative effect on net periodic pension expense in the near term 
while these assumptions may change in the future based on changes in long term interest rates and market conditions  there are no known expected changes in these assumptions as of june  as indicated above  to the extent the assumptions differ from actual results  there would be a future impact on the financial statements 
the extent to which this will result in future expense is not determinable at this time as it will depend upon a number of variables  including trends in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets 
during the quarter ended march   the annual actuarial valuation of the pension plan was completed 
based on this valuation  net periodic pension expense for fiscal was determined to be  versus the prior year s expense of  the components of net periodic pension expense are detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
no cash payments are expected to be required for the next several years due to the plan s funded status 
other litigation one of sparton s facilities  located in albuquerque  new mexico  has been the subject of ongoing investigations conducted with the environmental protection agency epa under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
the investigation began in the early s and involved a review of onsite and offsite environmental impacts 
at june   sparton has accrued  as its estimate of the future undiscounted minimum financial liability with respect to this matter 
the company s cost estimate is based upon existing technology and excludes legal and related consulting costs  which are expensed as incurred  and is anticipated to cover approximately the next years 
the company s estimate includes equipment and operating costs for onsite and offsite operations and is based on existing methodology 
uncertainties associated with environmental remediation contingencies are pervasive and often result in wide ranges of reasonably possible outcomes 
estimates developed in the early stages of remediation can vary significantly 
normally  a finite estimate of cost does not become fixed and determinable at a specific point in time 
rather  the costs associated with environmental remediation become estimable over a continuum of events and activities that help to frame and define a liability 
it is possible that cash flows and results of operations could be affected significantly by the impact of the ultimate resolution of this contingency 
some of the printed circuit boards supplied to the company for aerospace sales have been discovered to be defective 
the defect occurred during production at the board manufacturer s facility  prior to shipment to sparton for further processing 
all of the lots involved have yet to be identified and sparton  the board manufacturer  and our customer who received the defective boards are working to contain the defective boards 
while investigations are underway  million of related product and associated expenses have been classified in sparton s balance sheet within other long term assets as of june  as of this date  sparton has made a demand on the board manufacturer for reimbursement of all costs and expenses incurred  and the parties are engaged in discussions regarding the resolution of sparton s claim 
the likelihood that the claim will be resolved and the extent of sparton s exposure  if any  is unknown at this time  thus no loss contingency has been established at june  sparton is currently involved with a legal action  which is disclosed in part i legal proceedings  item of this report 
at this time  the company is unable to predict the outcome of this claim 
sparton corporation annual report 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk exposure the company manufactures its products in the united states and canada  and most recently in vietnam 
sales are to the us and canada  as well as other foreign markets 
the company is potentially subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to intercompany activity and balances and to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies 
also  adjustments related to the translation of the company s canadian and vietnamese financial statements into us dollars are included in current earnings 
as a result  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in the domestic and foreign markets in which the company operates 
however  minimal third party receivables and payables are denominated in foreign currency and the related market risk exposure is considered to be immaterial 
historically  foreign currency gains and losses related to intercompany activity and balances have not been significant 
however  due to the recent strengthened canadian dollar  the impact of transaction and translation gains has increased 
if the exchange rate were to materially change  the company s financial position could be significantly affected 
the company has financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk  principally short term investments 
historically  the company has not experienced material gains or losses due to such interest rate changes 
based on the current holdings of short term investments  the interest rate risk is not considered to be material
