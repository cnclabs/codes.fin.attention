item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company owns and publishes newspapers in four regions of the country minnesota  california  the carolinas and the northwest alaska and washington 
the company s newspapers range from large dailies serving metropolitan areas to non daily newspapers serving small communities 
the company supplements its newspaper publishing with an array of niche products and direct marketing initiatives  including direct mail 
the company also operates leading local websites in each of its daily newspaper markets offering users information  comprehensive news  advertising  e commerce and other services 
the company also owns and operates mcclatchy interactive formerly known as nando media  an interactive media operation that provides newspapers with content  publishing tools and software development 
the company s primary source of revenue is advertising 
while percentages vary from year to year  and from newspaper to newspaper  local retail advertising carried as a part of newspapers run of press or rop advertising or in advertising inserts placed in newspapers preprint advertising  generally contributes roughly of advertising revenues at the company s newspapers 
recent trends have been for certain national or regional retailers to use greater preprint advertising and less rop advertising  although that trend shifts from time to time 
nonetheless  rop advertising still makes up the majority of retail advertising 
classified advertising  primarily in automotive  employment and real estate categories  generally contributes about of advertising revenue and national advertising generally contributes about of total advertising 
online advertising  direct marketing and other advertising make up the remainder of the company s advertising revenues 
circulation revenues contribute roughly of the company s newspaper revenues  depending upon the size and locale of the newspaper 
most newspapers are delivered by independent contractors 
circulation revenues are recorded net of direct delivery costs 
see results of operations below for a discussion of the company s revenue performance and contribution by categories for fiscal  and critical accounting policies the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  future events are subject to change and 
table of contents the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment 
the most significant areas involving estimates and assumptions are revenue recognition  allowance for uncollectible accounts  amortization and or impairment of intangibles  pension and post retirement expenses  insurance reserves  and the company s tax provision 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  in particular  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition advertising revenues are recorded when advertisements are placed in the newspaper and circulation revenues are recorded as newspapers are delivered over the subscription term 
circulation revenues are recorded net of direct delivery costs 
other revenue is recognized when the related product or service has been delivered 
revenues are recorded net of estimated incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
revisions to these estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
allowance for uncollectible accounts the company maintains an allowance account for estimated losses resulting from the risk its customers will not make required payments 
generally  the company uses the aging of accounts receivable  reserving for all accounts due days or longer  to establish allowances for losses on accounts receivable 
however  if the financial condition of a customer deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances are reserved 
to illustrate the impact of a change to the allowance for uncollectible accounts  hypothetically  if the amount of receivables that are days or longer were to increase by  the company s allowance for estimated losses would have increased  at the end of fiscal goodwill and intangible impairment in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangibles  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
the company periodically analyzes its goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment 
no material impairment loss was recorded in fiscal  or pension and post retirement benefits the company has significant pension and post retirement benefit costs and credits that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including salary rate increases  discount rates and expected return on plan assets 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in establishing these assumptions 
changes in the related pension and post retirement benefit costs or credits may occur in the future because of changes resulting from fluctuations in the company s employee headcount and or changes in the various assumptions 
the company used a discount rate of  assumed salary rate increases of to and an assumed long term return on assets of to calculate its retirement expenses in fiscal  based upon consultation with its outside actuaries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more in depth discussion of the company s policies in setting its key assumptions related to these obligations 
for fiscal  a change in the weighted average rates would have had the following impact on our net benefit cost a decrease of basis points in the long term rate of return would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately million  
table of contents a decrease of basis points in the discount rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately million  and an increase of basis points in the future compensation rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately million 
the company has revised certain assumptions for its pension expense calculation 
please see recent events and trends operating expenses discussion below 
tax provision the company s current and deferred tax provisions are calculated based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments between the company s estimates and the actual results of filed returns are recorded when identified  which is generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for us federal and state provisions 
the amount of income taxes paid is subject to audits by federal and state authorities  which may result in proposed assessments 
the company s estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
management believes that the company has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters based upon currently available information 
however  future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
additionally  earnings or deductions estimated to be in each jurisdiction by the company may differ from actual amounts 
as a result of these potential adjustments  the company s effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
self insurance the company is self insured for workers compensation in california and alaska 
the company relies on claims experience and the advice of consulting actuaries and administrators in determining an adequate provision for self insurance claims 
the company used a discount rate of to calculate workers compensation reserves as of december  a decrease of basis points in the discount rate would have an immaterial effect on total workers compensation reserves 
additionally  a increase in claims would have increased total workers compensation reserves by approximately  at the end of fiscal recent events and trends recent acquisition and divestiture on january   the company purchased the assets of the merced sun star  a daily newspaper in merced  california and five non daily newspapers merced group for million in cash 

table of contents the purchase included million in intangible assets  the most significant of which was million of goodwill 
the acquisition and results of the merced group are included in the company s financial statements beginning on january  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
on june   the company sold the assets of the newspaper network tnn  a national sales and marketing company 
the associated press purchased tnn s ad processing operations and  separately  vertis  inc purchased tnn s sales and marketing assets 
total consideration from the sales was million including the assumption of liabilities 
the revenues and operating results of tnn are included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of income in fiscal refinancing of debt on may   the company entered into a five year  senior unsecured revolving credit facility credit agreement  which provides for borrowings of up to million from a syndicate of banks through may  the primary purpose of the credit agreement is to support the issuance of unsecured promissory notes under a commercial paper program commercial paper of up to million and for general corporate purposes 
initially  however  the company used the credit agreement to refinance all of its existing term debt and principal outstanding under the previous bank credit facility 
this debt was subsequently retired with proceeds of commercial paper during the second quarter of fiscal debt under the credit agreement bears interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus a spread ranging from basis points to basis points plus a utilization fee of basis points if borrowings exceed million 
applicable rates are based upon the company s ratings on its long term debt from moody s and standard poor s 
a facility fee for the revolving credit facility ranges from basis points to basis points depending on the company s ratings  and such fees are currently at basis points 
no debt was outstanding under the credit agreement at december  the company s commercial paper outstanding at december  had maturities ranging from overnight to days  with interest rates ranging from to 
the weighted average interest rate on commercial paper outstanding since may  inception of the program through december  was 
because the company s credit agreement provides backup for its commercial paper  and in accordance with the company s ability and intent  the commercial paper is classified as long term debt 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company recognized a charge  primarily consisting of previously capitalized loan fees  of million related to its previous debt agreement 
the write off was million after taxes 
advertising revenues the most significant trend in revenues for the newspaper industry and the company in recent years has been the decline in employment advertising revenues since the company s employment advertising revenues  which reached million in  declined to million in  and declined an additional to million in fiscal employment advertising improved in to million 

table of contents in fiscal  total advertising revenues grew to million compared to fiscal a rebound in employment revenues of from fiscal  together with growth in national revenue and continued growth of internet and direct marketing revenues  contributed to the increase in advertising revenue for fiscal in addition  the merced group contributed million in advertising revenues for fiscal please see the revenue discussions below under results of operations 
operating expenses the company incurred three newsprint price increases in and two in  resulting in an average increase of in newsprint prices in fiscal compared to fiscal an additional price increase has been announced for the first quarter of  however  the ultimate amount and or timing of any price increase is uncertain at this time 
newsprint pricing is largely dependent on global demand and supply for newsprint 
all other things being equal  a hypothetical per metric ton change in newsprint prices affects earnings per share by three cents annually 
the impact of newsprint price increases on the company s expenses is discussed under results of operations below 
the company s fringe benefit costs increased over fiscal due primarily to higher retirement and medical costs 
with regard to the company s retirement expenses  historically low long term interest rates caused the company to use a discount rate to calculate its pension and post retirement expenses in fiscal compared to a rate used in fiscal in addition  with an economic recovery anticipated by many analysts over the next several years  the company increased its assumed rate of salary increase from a range of to used in to a range of to in for its pension plans 
these factors have increased the company s pension expense in fiscal compared to the company contributed million to its pension plans in early fiscal  and expected earnings on this contribution partially offset these increases 
in  for purposes of calculating retirement expenses  the company has reduced its discount rate to and its expected return on assets to from used in  due to a continued decline in long term interest rates and expected lower investment returns on plan assets 
the company did not change the assumed range of salary rate increases for these changes are expected to increase retirement expenses and obligations 
as a result  the company voluntarily contributed million to its pension plans in early fiscal  and expects earnings on this contribution to partially offset these increases 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 

table of contents sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas  no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas r in our third quarter of fiscal under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r for all unvested stock options and restricted stock based upon the previously disclosed sfas methodology and amounts 
the retroactive methods would record compensation expense beginning with the first period restated for all unvested stock options and restricted stock 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and have not yet determined the method of adoption 
if the company were to expense the value of stock options for the full fiscal year  it would reduce earnings by an estimated to cents per share 
this estimate is based upon currently available information and actual results may differ when sfas r is adopted

classified advertising declined million  due primarily to a million decline in employment advertising  offset somewhat by strong advertising growth of million in classified real estate advertising 
automotive and other classified advertising declined million with only the california newspapers showing growth in these areas 
the decline in automotive is partially due to difficult comparisons to strong growth in this category in employment advertising was down at all newspapers as this industry wide trend of lower employment advertising continued  especially at larger metropolitan newspapers

table of contents risk factors that could affect operating results forward looking information this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements regarding the company s actual and expected financial performance and operations 
these statements are based upon our current expectations and knowledge of factors impacting our business  including  without limitation  statements about return on pension plan assets and assumed salary increases  newsprint costs  amortization expense  assumed medical cost trends  stock option expenses  prepayment of debt  capital expenditures  sufficiency of capital resources and possible acquisitions 
such statements are subject to risks  trends and uncertainties 
forward looking statements are generally preceded by  followed by or are a part of sentences that include the words believes  expects  anticipates  estimates  or similar expressions 
for those statements  we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of you should understand that the following important factors  in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this document and in the documents which we incorporate by reference  could affect the future results of mcclatchy  and could cause those future results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward looking statements general economic  market or business conditions  especially in any of the markets where we operate newspapers  geo political uncertainties including the risk of war  changes in newsprint prices and or printing and distribution costs from anticipated levels  changes in interest rates  changes in pension assets and liabilities  increased competition from newspapers or other forms of media in our principal markets  increased consolidation among major retailers in our newspaper markets or other events depressing the level of advertising  changes in our ability to negotiate and obtain favorable terms under collective bargaining arrangements with our employees  competitive actions by other companies  difficulties in servicing our debt obligations  other occurrences leading to decreased circulation and diminished revenues from both display and classified advertising  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
additional information regarding certain risks newsprint is the major component of our cost of raw materials 
newsprint accounted for of mcclatchy s operating expenses for fiscal accordingly  our earnings are sensitive to changes in newsprint prices 
we have not attempted to hedge fluctuations in the normal purchases of newsprint or enter into contracts with embedded derivatives for the purchase of newsprint 
if the price of newsprint increases materially  our operating results could be adversely affected 
for a discussion of the impact of a change in newsprint prices on the company s earnings per share  please see the newsprint discussion above at recent events and trends 
if our newsprint suppliers experience labor unrest  transportation difficulties or other supply disruptions  our ability to produce and deliver newspapers could be impaired and or the cost of the newsprint could increase  both of which would negatively affect our operating results 
if mcclatchy experiences labor unrest  our ability to produce and deliver newspapers would be impaired 
the results of future labor negotiations could harm our operating results 
our newspapers have not endured a labor strike since however  we cannot ensure that a strike will not occur at one or more of our newspapers in the future 
as of december   
table of contents approximately a quarter of our full and part time employees were represented by unions including at the star tribune and at the sacramento bee  the company s two largest newspapers 
most of the company s union represented employees are currently working under labor agreements  which expire at various times 
mcclatchy faces collective bargaining upon the expirations of these labor agreements 
even if our newspapers do not suffer a labor strike  the company s operating results could be harmed if the results of labor negotiations restrict our ability to maximize the efficiency of its newspaper operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all things being equal  a hypothetical basis point change in libor for a fiscal year would increase or decrease in the company s annual net income by  to  less than one cent per share
