item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations please read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under item business risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
general we are a leading regional provider of ip telephony and other network infrastructure and related implementation and support services 
the ip telephony industry is characterized by rapidly evolving and competing technologies 
we compete with larger and better financed entities 
our three principal offices are located in texas  and we primarily market to potential customers headquartered in  or making purchasing decisions from  texas 
our long term goal  however  is to become one of the leading national providers of cisco centric network and ip telephony solutions to enterprises 
we begin management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with an overview of our strategies for achieving this goal and improving profitability 
from a financial perspective  these operating strategies have a number of important implications for our results of operations and financial condition 
strategy we plan to improve profitability by implementing the strategies discussed below 
we believe that our strategies will allow us to continue to increase total revenues 
we also believe our strategies will enable us to improve our gross margins on inx revenue 
at the same time  we will seek to limit the growth of relatively fixed components of our selling  general and administrative expenses relative to the growth of revenue so that those expenses become a relatively smaller percentage of total revenues 
through a combination of increased revenue  slightly increased gross margin and somewhat decreased growth of selling  general and administrative expenses  relative to the growth of revenue  we hope to be able to increase our operating margin and increase profitability at a more rapid rate than revenue increases 
we expect that selling expenses can generally be expected to increase in proportion to our revenues increases 
for example  our sales staff earns sales commissions that are typically calculated as a percentage of gross profit produced 
historically  sales commissions have been approximately to of gross profit and we expect sales commissions to continue to consume similar percentages of total gross profit 
however  we believe that if we are successful in implementing our strategies  many general and administrative expenses such as management salaries  administrative wages and professional expenses will decrease as a percentage of our total revenues because we believe we can achieve some levels of leverage on certain of these operating expenses 
our key operating strategies include seeking larger  full scale ip telephony implementation projects  as opposed to smaller pilot projects  increasing the gross revenues from our higher gross margin operations  such as services and stratasoft custom projects  as opposed to product sales  which typically produce smaller gross margins  aligning ourselves with cisco as our exclusive supplier for the network and ip telephony equipment and technology that we offer  expanding geographically by acquiring complementary businesses and by opening our own offices  developing and marketing our own computer telephony software products that operate with and augment cisco centric ip telephony products  and developing and marketing our own proprietary equipment for certain ip communications solutions 
if we are successful in obtaining larger  full scale ip telephony implementation projects  we expect that our gross revenues from both products and services will increase because these projects  by their nature  typically require a substantially higher level of our services and more products than do smaller projects 
larger projects  however  can strain our financial resources 
increases in the size and volume of the ip telephony projects we undertake can also challenge our cash management 
for example  larger projects can reduce our available cash by requiring that we carry higher levels of inventory 
larger projects can also require other investments in working capital 
this is because  in some cases  we do not receive payments from our customers for extended periods of time 
until we invoice the customer and are paid  all of the cash expended on labor and products on the project remains invested in work in progress and accounts receivable 
we expect that we will need increasing levels of working capital in the future if we are successful in growing our business as we intend 
to meet our cash requirements to support planned growth  we expect to rely on capital provided from our operations and our credit facility  which is collateralized by our accounts receivable and substantially all of our assets 
in may  we raised capital through a public equity offering with net proceeds of million 
we used the net proceeds of this equity offering primarily for working capital and to repay interest bearing debt then outstanding under our credit facility 
although over of our revenue in was attributable to product sales  the gross profit margins on sales of our services have been substantially higher than those for sales of products  with the exception of sales of our proprietary stratasoft software products 
in  for example  the gross profit margin on sales of products by inx was  while the gross profit margin on sales of services by inx for that year was 
we plan to increase revenue from services  particularly our post implementation services for ip telephony 
the success of this aspect of our strategy largely depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced employees 
for the last three years  the largest component of our total cost of sales and service has been purchases of cisco centric ip telephony products by inx 
the majority of those purchases were directly from cisco 
we typically purchase from various wholesale distributors only when we cannot purchase products directly from cisco on a timely basis 
our reliance on cisco as the primary supplier for the network and ip telephony equipment and technology we offer means that our results of operations from period to period depend substantially on the terms upon which we are able to purchase these products from cisco and  to a much lesser extent  from wholesale distributors of cisco s products 
therefore  our ability to manage the largest component of our cost of sales and service is very limited and depends to a large degree on maintaining and growing our relationship with cisco 
our cost of products purchased from cisco can be substantially influenced by whether cisco sponsors sales incentive programs and whether we qualify for such incentives 
there is a risk that we may not meet the incentive criteria in the future 
in addition  we are typically reliant on cisco and their product pricing 
the respective timing of when vendor incentives become earned and determinable creates significant fluctuations in our gross margin 
we also plan to grow our business in other geographic areas through strategic acquisitions of similar businesses or by opening our own offices 
this aspect of our strategy can affect our financial condition and results of operations in many ways 
the purchase price for business acquisitions and the costs of opening offices may require substantial cash and may require us to incur long term debt 
the expenses of a geographic expansion in an area may well exceed the revenues attributable to a new business or office for some time  even if it performs as we expect 
additionally  it is possible that our acquisition activities may require that we record substantial amounts of goodwill if the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired  which we expect is likely 
to the extent an acquisition results in goodwill  we will reevaluate the value of that goodwill at least annually and adjust the value as appropriate 
if we determine that the value of the goodwill has decreased  the resulting adjustment could result in a non cash charge to earnings in the periods of revaluation 
developing new or substantially improved computer telephony software products will require us to expend cash and record software development expenses 
software development costs have been  and we expect will continue to be expensed because we expect to incur substantially all costs prior to achieving technological feasibility in developing a new or substantially improved software product 
eliminating minority interest in inx between april and march   our inx subsidiary had a minority interest 
the minority interest was eliminated through an exchange of the minority interest for an interest in i sector on march  prior to april  inx had been our wholly owned subsidiary 
in april  inx ceased to be a wholly owned subsidiary as the result of the issuance of inx common stock to the former owners of digital precision  inc  which inx acquired in april in connection with that acquisition  we agreed to issue to the seller million shares of inx common stock as additional purchase consideration for their business if certain employees remained employed through april   the first anniversary of the acquisition 
this condition was met and the inx stock was issued in april at the time of issuance of that inx common stock  we recognized additional customer list value of  as an intangible asset to be amortized over a two year period 
when that issuance occurred  our ownership percentage of inx s common stock declined to approximately  and we recognized  of minority interest on our balance sheet upon issuance 
since we owned of inx s stock for december   our interest in inx s future profits and losses have been reduced for the minority share 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  our consolidated financial statements for the period through the exchange will reflect a minority interest adjustment of the reportable profits and losses of inx attributable to the minority ownership 
for  we reported income attributable to minority interest of  in our statement of operations and a minority interest balance of  in our balance sheet 
on february  we entered into an agreement with the inx minority shareholder group to merge inx into i sector  contingent upon i sector stockholder approval 
upon stockholder approval on march   inx became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the exchange of the minority interest resulted in a remeasurement of the stock options that were part of the minority interest and such remeasurement resulted in a million one time non cash charge to earnings  which was equal to the intrinsic value of the stock options on march  this one time non cash charge to earnings  which does not impact assets or liabilities  will reduce reported net income and earnings per share in our first quarter ending march  the elimination of the minority interest will simplify our capital structure and eliminate the minority interest on our financial statements  but will increase the shares used to compute diluted earnings per share due to the shares of our common stock issued in the exchange and because of the increased number of stock options resulting from exchanging inx stock options for our stock options 
based on the closing stock price of on march   we expect shares used in computing diluted earnings per share to increase by approximately  shares as a result of the exchange of the minority interest 
results of operations overview sources of revenue 
our revenue is derived from three segments represented by our three operating subsidiaries  inx  stratasoft and valerent 
during the year ended december   inx  stratasoft and valerent accounted for  and  respectively  of total consolidated revenue 
inx revenue consists of product and service revenue 
product revenue consists of reselling cisco products and limited amounts of complementary products from other manufacturers 
service revenue is generated by fees from a variety of implementation and support services 
product prices for inx are set by the market for cisco products and provide our lowest gross margins 
service revenue for inx has generally increased over the past several years as the cost of inx s technical resources  which are reflected as a cost of service  has decreased as a percentage of services revenue 
certain fixed and flat fee service contracts that extend over three months or more are accounted for on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
historically  the majority of inx s services revenue has been generated from implementation services  which is project oriented and tends to be volatile 
as the number  frequency and size of inx projects has grown  inx has achieved better utilization of its engineering resources  resulting in improved gross margins on services 
the normal sales cycle for corporate customers typically ranges from three to six months depending on the nature  scope and size of the project 
our experience with educational organizations utilizing e rate funding  which is a federal government funding program for schools administered by the schools and libraries division universal services administrative corporation the sld indicates that the sales cycle is generally about six to twelve months or longer 
since the latter part of  inx has experienced payment delays for amounts due from educational organization projects that are being partially funded by the sld 
the sld has informed us that these payment delays are due to administrative issues within the sld 
in november  pending a satisfactory resolution of the issues causing the payment delays  or payment of a substantial portion of the past due amounts  we temporarily suspended product shipments for certain sld funded projects in november based on communications from the sld that payments were being processed  limited amounts of product shipments were made in december for a significant project that was previously suspended 
after december  the sld made significant payments on past due accounts and we resumed product shipments for the previously suspended sld funded projects 
at december  our total net accounts receivable of million included approximately million of net e rate funded accounts receivable  approximately million of which were amounts related to a single sld funded project that had been temporarily suspended due to a past due balance of million  however  as of march  approximately million of the past due balance had been collected 
for the year ending december  inx has approximately million of revenue derived from e rate funded projects included in its million of total annual revenue 
while collections have occurred for our more significantly aged invoices  we anticipate that we will continue to experience payment delays for sld funded educational projects due to increased administration standards imposed upon the sld and continued changes at the sld and the e rate program 
in mid  inx introduced netsurant  its branded support service that consists primarily of customer service personnel and a support center 
this new support service offering requires that we incur the fixed cost to operate a network operations center to monitor customer s systems 
the fixed operating cost has resulted in negative gross margins from this new netsurant service offering 
we recognize the support service revenue evenly over the entire service period for the customer 
eventually  we expect that the netsurant support offering will improve overall services gross margins 
through december   netsurant service revenue was insignificant 
stratasoft revenue consists primarily of custom project revenue from the sale of proprietary computer telephony software 
stratasoft revenue is reported as custom project revenue in our statements of operations  because it consists of bundled products and services which cannot be accounted for separately 
stratasoft has traditionally produced our highest gross margin since it s revenues consists primarily of sales of our proprietary computer telephony software 
our cost of goods sold for stratasoft s custom project revenue includes the costs of developing our computer telephony software products  installation costs  and the cost of hardware and other equipment bundled with our software applications and included in a sale to a customer 
stratasoft utilizes the percentage of completion method of accounting to recognize the majority of its revenue 
stratasoft revenue also includes sales to resellers 
the sales to resellers are recorded when the sale becomes fixed or determinable  otherwise revenue from resellers is recorded when payments become due 
valerent revenue consists of both product revenue and service revenue 
product revenue consists of reselling primarily software products  and to a lesser degree  hardware products  that facilitate valerent s managed services  including remote management software products from altiris  inc  and security software products from network associates  inc product sales prices for valerent are set by the market for these products  and valerent s product sales have typically provided lower gross profit margins than its services revenue 
valerent s service revenue consists of remote and onsite technical assistance to its customers 
valerent s gross margin on service revenue  much like inx s implementation services revenue  is subject to variability based upon the utilization of valerent s billable technical resources 
recurring service agreements exist with some customers  but usually with varying terms and conditions that conform to their year over year business changes and their specific needs 
while these agreements provide somewhat predictable and stable sources of revenue  the loss of a recurring agreement could disrupt the stability of valerent s revenues 
gross profit and gross profit margin 
the mix of our various revenue components  each of which has substantially different levels of gross margin  materially influences our overall gross profit and gross margin in any particular quarter 
in periods in which service revenue or stratasoft custom project revenue are high  as compared to inx and valerent product sales  our gross margin generally improves as compared to periods in which we have higher levels of product sales 
our gross margin for product sales also varies depending on the type of product sold  the mix of large revenue product contracts  which typically have lower gross margin  as compared to smaller revenue product contracts  which typically have higher gross margin 
our gross margin percentage on product sales and services revenue has generally improved over the past several years 
gross margin percentage on product sales have improved primarily due to increased repeat business with existing customers  which are typically smaller transactions that generate slightly higher levels of gross margin as compared to large  competitively bid projects 
in addition  we have benefited from increased levels of vendor incentives  which lower our cost of goods sold 
our annual and quarterly gross profits and gross margins on inx product sales are materially affected by vendor incentives recognized in certain accounting periods  most of which are cisco incentive programs initiated in the incentive programs sponsored by cisco currently enable us to qualify for cash rebates or product pricing discounts 
the most significant incentive is a cisco incentive that is generally earned based on sales volumes of particular cisco products  sales growth and customer satisfaction levels  and beginning in our fourth quarter ended december  this incentive program could be readily monitored by us via access to the vendor s website 
the amounts earned and costs incurred under these programs are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold  and the increased gross profit results in an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses related to sales commissions 
in reporting periods prior to our fourth quarter ended december   we recognized the cisco incentives on the earlier of when payment was received or declared by the vendor  as such amounts were not determinable by us prior to then 
prior to  there had only been one incentive program measurement period  and we had not met all of the qualification criteria for such incentive period 
cisco pays incentives earned under this program semi annually for the six month measurement periods that end one month following the end of our second and fourth quarters 
this caused significant fluctuations in gross profit and operating profits from quarter to quarter because these incentives were recognized semi annually in our first and third quarters 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  the information became readily available from the vendor so that the amount of incentive earned from the vendor was determinable 
furthermore  we determined that collection of the incentive was probable and therefore recognizable 
for  the inx products cost of goods was million of inx product revenue  which is net of million of vendor incentives recognized 
for  the inx product cost of goods was million of inx product revenue  which is net of  in vendor incentives recognized 
our product cost and resulting gross profit can vary significantly depending upon vendor pricing incentives and our ability to qualify for and recognize such incentives 
our gross margin percentage on service revenue has also generally improved over the past several years 
a significant portion of our cost of services for each of our service businesses is comprised of labor 
our gross margin on service revenue fluctuates from period to period depending not only upon the prices charged to customers for our services  but also upon the level of utilization of our technical staff 
management of labor cost is important to maximize gross margin 
our gross margin is also impacted by such factors as contract size  time and material pricing versus fixed fee pricing  discounting  vendor incentives and other business and marketing factors normally incurred during the conduct of business 
several years ago  early in inx s development  we purposely over staffed technical and engineering staff in order to have the technical competency necessary to gain market share and create a successful organization 
over the past several years  as inx has grown  we have been able to better utilize our technical and engineering staff and this has helped to improve the gross margin percentage on service revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses include both fixed and variable expenses 
relatively fixed expenses in selling  general and administrative expenses include rent  utilities  promotion and advertising  and administrative wages 
variable expenses in selling  general and administrative expenses include sales commissions and travel  which will usually vary based on our sales and gross profit 
selling  general and administrative expenses also include expenses which vary significantly from period to period but not in proportion to sales or gross profit 
these include legal expenses and bad debt expense both of which vary based on factors that are difficult to predict 
a significant portion of our selling  general and administrative expenses relate to personnel costs  some of which are variable and others that are relatively fixed 
our variable personnel costs consist primarily of sales commissions 
sales commissions are typically calculated based upon our gross profit on a particular sales transaction and thus generally fluctuate because of the size of the transaction and the mix of associated products and services with our overall gross profit 
historically  sales commission expense has been approximately to of gross profit  and we expect that it will continue to be approximately that level in the future 
bad debt expense generally fluctuates somewhat in proportion to sales levels  although not always in the same periods as increases or decreases in sales 
legal expense varies based on legal issue activity  which can vary substantially from period to period 
the remainder of selling  general and administrative expenses are relatively fixed and do not vary in direct proportion to increases in revenue  but will generally increase over time as the organization grows 
we believe that we can achieve some level of leverage on these somewhat fixed operating expenses  relative to revenue growth  and if we are successful in doing so that this will help to increase our net operating margin 
acquisition and disposition 
in the second quarter of  inx acquired the fixed assets  inventory  intellectual property  customer lists  trademarks  trade names  service marks  contract rights and other intangibles of digital precision 
in connection with that acquisition we also assumed leases for equipment and office space 
our results of operations include those attributable to digital precision on and after april  the initial purchase price for digital precision was  in cash and contingent consideration of million shares of inx common stock which we agreed to issue if certain employees remained employed through april   the first anniversary of the acquisition 
in april  we recorded  of additional intangible assets in connection with the million shares of inx stock we issued to satisfy the contingent purchase price obligation 
the sale of our computer reselling and pbx telephone systems reselling business in early and the sale of our it staffing business in resulted in a gain on disposal 
since the sale of these businesses  we have realized  in various periods  income and expense from discontinued operations that has been primarily a result of litigation expenses and settlement of litigation related to our discontinued operations 
we expect the income and expense from discontinued operations to decrease over time and to eventually be eliminated after these matters are fully resolved 
tax loss carryforward 
because of our operating losses in  we have accumulated a net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes that  as of december   was approximately million and is available to offset future federal and state taxable income 
this carryforward expires in in addition to potential expiration  there are several factors that could limit or eliminate our ability to use these carryforwards 
for example  under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  use of prior net operating loss carryforwards is limited after an ownership change 
if we achieve sustained profitability  which may not happen  the use of net operating loss carryforwards would reduce our tax liability and increase our net income and available cash resources 
when all operating loss carryforwards have been used or have expired  we would again be subject to increased tax expense and reduced earnings due to such tax expense period comparisons 
the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data derived from our consolidated statements of operations 
percentages shown in the table below are percentages of total revenue  except for each individual segment s cost of sales and services  gross profit  selling  general and administrative expenses  and operating income  which are percentages of the respective segment s revenue  and the product and service components of the inx and valerent segments cost of goods sold and gross profit  which are percentages of such segment s respective product and service revenue

our total revenue  net of intercompany eliminations  increased by million  or  from million to million 
inx revenue increased by million  or  from million to million 
as a percentage of total revenue  inx revenue increased from to 
of the increase  million was attributed to our office in austin  million was attributed to government sector sales and million was attributed to the large project for the dallas independent school district 
these increases were partially offset by revenue decreases of million in our houston operation and million in our dallas operation excluding the disd project 
inx s revenue grew rapidly primarily due to large sales to school districts totaling million 
the sales to the school districts are one time competitive bid events fostered by the e rate programs that provide schools with of their funding for internet related expenditures  and there can be no assurance as to the level of revenue provided  if any  in future periods from school districts 
stratasoft revenue increased by million  or  from million to million 
as a percentage of total revenue  stratasoft revenue decreased from to 
stratasoft s international sales accounted for of stratasoft s revenue as compared to in the increase in revenue is primarily attributed to the implementation of larger voip projects during stratasoft has its own internally managed sales force  but it also utilizes dealer agreements from time to time with certain established resellers in domestic and international markets that do not require the continued involvement of our personnel 
stratasoft derived  or of its revenue from sales to resellers in which compares with  or of revenue in sales to resellers are included in revenue when the fees are fixed and determinable  otherwise revenue from resellers is deferred and recognized when the payment becomes due 
valerent revenue increased by million  or  from million to million

gross margin increased from to  primarily because of the increase in gross margin in our inx and stratasoft subsidiaries as discussed below 
inx gross profit increased million  or  from million to million 
inx s gross margin increased from to 
inx s gross profit on its product sales increased million or  from million to million due to increased product sales revenue and lower product cost that now includes rebates 
inx s gross profit on its service component increased  from million to million  and service gross margin improved from to  as a result of significantly increased service revenue of million and improved utilization of technical personnel 
stratasoft gross profit increased by  or  from million to million 
stratasoft s gross margin decreased from to 
stratasoft gross profit was impacted by the mix of sales between systems sales  which include a hardware component  as compared to software only sales  which do not have a hardware component 
stratasoft s decreased gross profit is primarily due to an increased product component of total stratasoft sales 
software only sales primarily relate to reseller customers and do not require the continuing involvement of our personnel 
valerent gross profit increased by  or 
valerent s gross margin increased from to 
valerent improved its utilization of its labor pool by reducing the number of technicians employed and lowering its fixed cost  which contributed to improved gross profits 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or from million to million 
as a percentage of total revenue  these expenses decreased  from to 
these expenses were primarily increased by the following sales compensation increased million as a result of hiring additional personnel as the result of hiring additional sales staff and increased sales commissions generated from the increase in gross profit 
administrative compensation expense increased  due to bonuses of  settlement of an eeoc claim for  the hiring of additional personnel at inx in houston and dallas  texas  and for the addition of the san antonio  texas office 
stratasoft hired personnel in houston  texas and canada 
payroll tax expense increased  with the increase in compensation expenses 
general office expense increased  primarily from office and employee relocation expenses and increased printing costs 
depreciation expense increased  due to asset additions and the digital precision acquisition in april rents increased  due to additional office space in dallas and san antonio  texas 
shareholder relations expense increased  due to employing a shareholder relations firm  attending investor conferences and visiting investor groups  however this expense was partially offset by a  reduction related to the revaluation of the non employee stock option compensation for the investor relation consultant 
entertainment expense increased  due to a customer seminar sponsored by stratasoft and employee s meals incurred while traveling 
communication expense increased  due to growth 
utilities expense increased  due to growth 
these expenses were primarily decreased by the following bad debt expense decreased  due to recoveries of bad debt and decreases in allowances based on the aging of receivables and credit worthiness of customers 
advertising and promotion decreased  with downsizing of promotional campaigns within stratasoft 
insurance expense decreased  because of policy and rate changes contract labor expense decreased  primarily from stratasoft terminating contract labor in india offset by  for technicians and programmers 
we expect our future selling  general and administrative expenses to increase as we ensure our compliance with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of as well as our expected growth within our inx subsidiary 
operating income 
operating income increased million  or from a million loss to a profit of million  primarily due to the million increase in gross profit  partially offset by the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses

stratasoft s operating loss decreased million  or from a loss of million to a loss of  valerent s operating income increased  or from a loss of  to a profit of  the operating loss for the corporate segment decreased  or from a loss of million to an operating loss of  interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income  net  decreased by  or  from income of  to expense of  primarily due to an increase in interest expense of  or from  to  which is attributable to interest expense due to increased borrowings under our credit facility 
our borrowings under our credit facility increased from million to million while the interest bearing portion of our borrowings increased from million at december  to million at december  foreign exchange gain increased  from a loss of  to a gain of  other income decreased  or from a  to  expense 
net income 
the net income increased million  or from a loss of million to a net profit of million 
the benefit for income taxes decreased  or from  to  because the job creation and worker assistance act of provided for the carryback of net operating losses for any taxable year ending during or to each of the tax years preceding the loss year  we were able to use our net operating loss carryback 
the benefit in includes amounts related to additional carryback benefits for not previously recorded 
minority interest of  was recorded for as a reduction of our net income due to the  shares of inx common stock issued to certain key employees as part of the digital precision acquisition agreement 
upon issuance of stock our ownership of inx was reduced from to approximately 
discontinued operations 
during  we discontinued our telecom systems business 
on march  we entered into an agreement to sell certain assets of  and the ongoing operation of  our computer products division 
the sale transaction closed on may  on december   we sold our it staffing business 
as a consequence of these events  the operations of these businesses are reported as discontinued operations 
for the year ended december   the gain on disposal related to these three businesses was   and  net of taxes of   and  for a total gain of  for the year ended december  the gain on disposal related to these three businesses was   and  net of taxes of   and  for a total gain of  the gains and or losses on disposal related to these discontinued operations are primarily related to collections of accounts receivables retained when these businesses were sold 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  total revenue 
our total revenue  net of intercompany eliminations  increased by million  or  from million to million 
inx revenue increased by million  or  from million to million 
as a percentage of total revenue  inx revenue increased from to 
of the increase  million was attributed to the houston office  million was attributed to a new office in austin  million was attributed to government sector sales and million was attributed to the dallas office 
the increase in revenue attributable to the digital precision acquisition  including the million of revenue of the acquired austin office  was million 
inx s revenue grew rapidly primarily due to large sales to four school districts totaling million and due to synergy of million resulting from its acquisition of digital precision 
the sales to the school districts are one time competitive bid events fostered by the erate programs that provide schools with of their funding for internet related expenditures  and there can be no assurance as to the level of revenue provided  if any  in future periods from school districts 
stratasoft revenue increased by  or  from million to million 
as a percentage of total revenue  stratasoft revenue decreased from to 
stratasoft s increased revenue was primarily the result of two large international custom projects in  as compared to no individually large custom projects initiated during this was slightly offset by deferred revenue for certain custom projects that included fees that were determined to not be fixed and determinable in stratasoft s international sales accounted for of stratasoft s revenue as compared to in stratasoft has it own internally managed sales force  but it also utilizes dealer agreements from time to time with certain established resellers in domestic and international markets that do not require the continued involvement of our personnel 
stratasoft derived  or of its revenue from sales to resellers in which compares with  or of revenue in sales to resellers are included in revenue when the fees are fixed and determinable  otherwise revenue from resellers is deferred and recognized when the payment becomes due 
valerent revenue increased by  or  from million to million 
as a percentage of total revenue  valerent revenue decreased from to 
the increase in valerent revenue was primarily attributable to decreased service revenue of  offset by increased product sales of  the decrease in service revenue is primarily attributable to the loss of revenue from certain customers of  which was primarily related to valerent making changes to its business model so that it no longer pursued certain non strategic sources of services revenue 
valerent s business model now focuses on identifying and developing markets with enterprise customers and we expect that the redirection will provide generally improved margins in the future 
gross profit 
our total gross profit increased by million  or  from million to million 
gross margin increased from to  primarily because of the increase in gross margin in our inx and stratasoft subsidiaries as discussed below 
inx gross profit increased million  or  from million to million 
inx s gross margin increased from to 
inx s gross profit on its product sales component increased million or  from million to million due to increased product sales revenue and a vendor rebate of  inx s gross profit on its service component increased million  from  to million  and service gross margin improved from to  as a result of significantly increased service revenue of million with a somewhat fixed cost of service component due to improved utilization of technical personnel 
stratasoft gross profit increased by  or  from million to million 
stratasoft s gross margin increased from to 
stratasoft gross profit was impacted by the mix of sales between systems sales  which include a hardware component  as compared to software only sales  which do not have a hardware component 
stratasoft s increased gross profit is primarily due to an increased software only component relative to the systems sales component of total stratasoft sales 
software only sales primarily relate to reseller customers and do not require the continuing involvement of our personnel 
valerent gross profit increased by  or 
valerent s gross margin increased from to 
valerent s cost of service consists primarily of fixed labor cost that does not fluctuate directly with changes in revenue 
valerent improved its utilization of its labor pool by reducing the number of technicians employed and lowering its fixed cost  which contributed to improved gross profits 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or from million to million 
as a percentage of total revenue  these expenses decreased  from to 
sales compensation increased  due to corresponding increase in sales 
legal and professional fees increased  due to an eeoc claim  collection efforts  and commercial disputes in the ordinary course of business 
administrative compensation expense increased  due to hiring additional inx and stratasoft personnel in houston  dallas  canada and india 
payroll tax expense increased  correspondingly with compensation expenses 
contract labor expense increased  to supplement technical service labor need to fulfill contractual obligations 
travel expense increased  primarily due to stratasoft international travel and inx travel for technical staff and management 
general office expenses increased  due to printing and general growth 
insurance expense increased  because of rate increases and volume increases 
shareholder relations expense increased  due to employing a shareholder relations firm  attending investor conferences and visiting investor groups 
depreciation expense increased  due to asset additions and the digital precision acquisition in april rents increased  due to additional office space in austin and dallas 
other corporate expenses increased  due to our overall growth 
operating loss 
operating loss decreased  or from million to million  primarily due to the million increase in gross profit being offset by the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
inx s operating profit increased million  or from a loss of  to a profit of  stratasoft s operating loss increased million  or from a loss of  to a loss of million 
valerent s operating loss decreased  or from million to  the operating loss for the corporate segment increased  or from a loss of  to an operating loss of million 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  decreased by  or  from  to  primarily due to a decrease in interest income of  or from  to  which is attributable to interest on the settlement of a past due customer account in the decrease in interest income was also affected by an increase in interest expense of  or  from  to  due to increased borrowings used to finance inventory purchases to supply the increased business activity 
our borrowings under the textron credit facility increased from million to million while the interest bearing portion of our borrowings increased from at december  to million at december  foreign exchange loss increased  from to a loss of  other income increased  or from a loss of  to  net loss 
the net loss increased million  or from  to million 
the benefit for income taxes decreased million or from million to  because the job creation and worker assistance act of provided for the carryback of net operating losses for any taxable year ending during or to each of the tax years preceding the loss year  we were able to use our net operating loss carryback 
the benefit in includes amounts related to additional carryback benefits for not previously recorded 
discontinued operations 
during  we discontinued our telecom systems business 
on march  we entered into an agreement to sell certain assets of  and the ongoing operation of  our computer products division 
the sale transaction closed on may  on december   we sold our it staffing business 
as a consequence of these events  the operations of these businesses are reported as discontinued operations 
for the year ended december   the gain on disposal related to these three businesses was   and  net of taxes of   and  for a net total of  for the year ended december  the gain on disposal related to these three businesses was   and  net of taxes of   and  for a total gain of  the gains and or losses on disposal related to these discontinued operations are primarily related to collections of accounts receivables retained when these businesses were sold 
quarterly results the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly financial information for each of our last eight quarters and  in the opinion of management  includes all adjustments consisting of only normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the information set forth therein 
our quarterly results may vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of large customer orders  timing of new product introductions  adequacy of product supply  variations in our product costs  variations in our product mix  promotions  seasonal influences and fluctuations in competitive pricing pressures 
the results of any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year or any future period

for the fourth quarter ended december   our revenue decreased sequentially as compared to the exceptionally strong third quarter because of the delayed shipments pending resolution of the e rate funded payment delays  but the fourth quarter revenue did increase as compared to the fourth quarter of our gross profit has fluctuated between quarters primarily due to changes in our revenue mix between services revenues in inx and valerent and our stratasoft custom project revenue  which have generally generated higher margins  and the lower margin components of our business including product sales in inx and stratasoft 
while inx and valerent service gross margin increased significantly for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to the fiscal year ended december   quarter to quarter gross margin levels have varied primarily based on the level of utilization of billable technical staff and the type of service revenues generated  which can vary from period to period and result in varying levels of gross margin 
while product gross profit also increased for both inx and valerent for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to the fiscal year ended december   the levels of gross margin have also varied between quarters based on the type of product sold and the mix of large revenue product contracts  which typically have lower gross margin  as compared with smaller revenue product contracts  which typically have a higher gross margin 
the respective timing of when vendor incentives become earned and determinable has created significant quarter to quarter gross margin fluctuations 
while we expect vendor incentives will remain earned and determinable in future periods  we do not have any assurance that we will continue to meet the vendor incentive criteria required to receive the incentive or that the vendor will continue to offer incentive programs during the future 
our third quarter gross margin improved in comparison to both the prior quarter and the third quarter of the improved gross margin was the result of higher product revenue from inx and inx vendor incentives  which produces our highest gross margin 
our fourth quarter gross margin increased in comparison to the third and fourth quarter of the increase in gross profit in comparison to the third quarter resulted from vendor incentives and higher profit margin from inx services 
in the third quarter of our selling  general and administrative expenses increased as compared to previous quarters due to increases in sales commissions resulting higher revenue and vendor incentives 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of decreased as compared to the third quarter primarily because of decreased expenses from lower sales commissions related to the decreased level of sales and gross profits during the quarter 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition we have a number of different revenue sources  which vary between our three reportable segments 
each reportable segment has more than one revenue source  and revenue is recognized differently for each component or stream of revenue earned by segment 
the material revenue streams earned by us are products revenue 
all three of our operating segments earn revenue from product shipments 
product shipment revenue occurs when products manufactured by other parties are purchased and resold to a customer and such products are purchased from us independent of our providing any material services 
we recognize revenue from product shipments when there are binding contracts or purchase orders  the price is fixed or determinable  the product is shipped or delivered to the customer and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in all three segments  the four criteria for revenue recognition have been met because there are written  executed contracts  or in the case of inx and valerent  in some situations there are binding purchase orders  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  stratasoft  however  recognizes revenue on the percentage of completion method  as described below 
the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
each of our business segments performs credit research prior to extending credit 
in stratasoft s business segment  a substantial portion of the total contract price is received in cash or letter of credit when the unit is installed 
service revenue 
all of our operating segments earn revenue from providing stand alone services 
these revenues consist of billings for engineering and technician time  programming services  which are provided on either an hourly basis or a flat fee basis  and the service component of maintenance and repair service ticket transactions 
these services are contracted for separately from any product sale 
revenue is recognized when the service is performed  the service is expected to be completed in less than three months  and collection is reasonably assured 
some of our segments earn agency fee revenue from various sources  primarily from as a result of our referring customers to other organizations for which an agency fee is received 
revenue is recognized at the earlier of when payment is received or when notification of amounts being due is received from the entity paying the agency fee  and collectiblity is reasonably assured 
certain fixed and flat fee contracts that extend over three months or more are accounted for using the percentage of completion method of method of accounting 
the percentage of revenue recognized in any particular period is determined based the relationship of the actual hours worked to estimated total hours to complete the contract 
revisions of the estimated hours to complete are reflected in the period in which the facts necessitating the revisions become known 
when a contract indicates a loss  a provision is made for the total anticipated loss 
custom project revenue 
one of our segments  stratasoft  earns revenue from projects that are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the majority of stratasoft s revenue consists of systems sales in which it bundles its proprietary software  along with third party hardware products and software customization services  installation  training services  warranty services and incidental post contract services pcs together under a single contract 
pcs is insignificant on contracts with a term of one year or less  and therefore  we have determined that the value of pcs should not be unbundled from the project revenue as set forth in paragraph of sop 
software revenue recognition 
accordingly  pcs revenue recognized together with the project revenue  and the estimated cost to provide the pcs is accrued 
the software customization  together with the hardware customization and integration  represent a significant modification  customization and or production of the product and therefore the entire arrangement is required to be accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting pursuant to sop 
accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the percentage of revenue recognized in any particular period is determined principally on the basis of the relationship of the cost of work performed on the contract to estimated total costs 
the percentage of completion method relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
revisions of estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts necessitating the revisions become known 
when a contract indicates a loss  a provision is made for the total anticipated loss 
we have risk to the extent that this group of customers have not paid or issued contractual letters of credit up to the level of cost and earnings recognized 
on our projects in south asia we typically require a cash payment or letter of credit from the customer prior to shipping the product 
additionally  stratasoft has had revenue derived from africa  the united kingdom  and canada 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and notes receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
credit and collections policy inherent in our revenue recognition policy is the determination of the collectibility of amounts due from our customers  which requires us to use estimates and exercise judgment 
we routinely monitor our customer s payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectibility is reasonably assured and  then in some instances  require letters of credit in support of contracted amounts 
this requires us to make frequent judgments and estimates in order to determine the appropriate period to recognize a sale to a customer and the amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts 
we record provisions for doubtful accounts when it becomes evident that the customer will not be able to make the required payments either at contractual due dates or in the future 
changes in the financial condition of our customers  either adverse or positive  could impact the amount and timing of any additional provision for doubtful accounts that may be required 
we recognize vendor incentive rebates when we meet the vendor s sales volume and customer satisfaction levels set by the vendor 
failure to achieve the levels set by the vendor could result in us not receiving a vendor incentive and result in lower gross margins for our company 
vendor incentive recognition 
one of our segments  inx  participates in a significant vendor incentive program 
these incentives are generally earned by sales volume  sales growth and customer satisfaction levels 
the amounts earned under these programs are accrued when they are deemed probable and can be reasonably measured  otherwise  they are recorded when they are declared by the vendor or the cash is received  which ever is earlier 
the incentives are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods 
selling  general and administrative expenses are increased for any associated commission expense and payroll tax related to the incentives 
when vendor incentives are recognized upon vendor declaration or cash receipt  then their effect on cost of goods can vary significantly between quarterly and annual reporting periods 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity our principal sources of liquidity are collections from our accounts and notes receivable  and our credit facility with textron financial corporation the textron facility 
in  we also received approximately million in net proceeds from a public offering 
we use the textron facility to finance the majority of our purchases of inventory  and to provide working capital when our cash flow from operations is insufficient 
in  we experienced negative cash flow from operating activities of million 
our working capital was million and million at december  and  respectively 
accounts and notes receivable 
the timing of our collection of accounts and notes receivable and payments of our accounts payable is one of the principal influences on our cash flow from operations 
we typically sell our products and services on short term credit terms 
we try to minimize our credit risk by performing credit checks  obtaining letters of credit in certain instances  and conducting our own collection efforts 
we had accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  of million and million at december  and  respectively 
our stratasoft subsidiary has accepted customer notes receivable as part of its consideration for certain of its custom projects sales 
at december  and december   stratasoft had net notes receivable of  and million  respectively 
the current portion of those notes receivable is reflected on our balance sheets as current portion of notes receivable  net  and the long term portion of the notes receivable is reflected on our balance sheets as notes receivable  net 
the following table shows the breakdown of the total notes receivable december  dollars in thousands current portion of notes receivable  gross   allowance for doubtful notes current portion of notes receivable  net  long term portion of notes receivable  gross allowance for doubtful notes long term portion of notes receivable  net total notes receivable  net  our stratasoft subsidiary also has other sales that require payment to occur more than days but less than twelve months from the date of the sale 
those outstanding balances are classified as accounts receivable on the accompanying balance sheets 
inventory 
we had inventory of million and million at december  and  respectively 
we try to minimize the amount of inventory on hand to reduce the risk that the inventory will become obsolete or decline in value 
we are able to do this by relying on the ready availability of products from our principal suppliers 
as noted above  we rely principally on our textron facility to finance our inventory purchases 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes certain of our contractual cash obligations and related payments due as of december  payments due by period dollars in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years lease obligations   textron  interest bearing debt   other debt obligations total contractual cash obligations 
   we do not have any material contractual purchase obligations 
we purchase inventory to fulfill in hand orders from customers and we try to minimize the amount of inventory on hand to reduce risk that the inventory will become obsolete or decline in value 
we are able to do this by relying on the ready availability of products from our principal suppliers 
we expect to be able to meet our contractual cash payment obligations by their due dates through cash generated from operations  augmented  if needed  by borrowings under the textron facility  and with the proceeds of our recent public offering 
textron facility 
on january   we entered into the textron facility to provide financing for our inventory purchases 
on september  the agreement was amended and the maximum credit available under the textron facility is presently million and it is collateralized by substantially all of our assets other than our patent licenses 
as of december   we owed million under the textron facility and had an additional million available subject to borrowing base restrictions 
the unused availability is the amount not borrowed  but eligible to be borrowed 
the unused portion of the facility is the amount not borrowed  but that amount may not be eligible for borrowing because of the borrowing base restrictions 
the borrowing base restrictions generally restrict our borrowings under the textron facility to of the eligible receivables and of our flooplanned inventory which cannot exceed the lesser of of our eligible accounts receivable or million  however  while doing business with disd this is increased to of our eligible accounts receivable or million we use the textron facility to finance purchases of cisco products from cisco and from certain wholesale distributors 
cisco provides day terms  and other wholesale distributors typically provide day terms 
balances under the textron facility that are within those respective day and day periods the free finance period do not accrue interest and are classified as accounts payable in our balance sheet 
we refer to non interest bearing balances as inventory floor plan borrowings 
to the extent that we have credit availability under the textron facility  it gives us the ability to extend the payment terms past the free finance period 
amounts extended past the free finance period accrue interest and are classified as notes payable on our balance sheet 
these extended payment balances under the textron facility accrue interest at the prime rate at december  plus 
because payment cycles of sales to school districts under the e rate program often extend beyond days  and because such payment cycles have recently extended even further due to administrative issues with the organization that makes payments to vendors for the e rate program  we expect we will continue to carry extended payment balances under the textron facility for at least the next several quarters 
the total outstanding balance under the textron facility at december  was million 
million of the outstanding balance was within the free finance period and therefore is reflected as accounts payable in our balance sheet at december  million with accrued interest of  is reflected as notes payable and accrued expense  respectively  at december  as defined in the textron facility there are restrictive covenants that are measured at each quarter and year end 
these covenants require us to maintain minimum tangible capital funds of million  which is defined to be the sum of cash  receivables  inventory and fixed net assets  minus total liabilities  with total liabilities being defined as accounts payable  accrued expenses and short and long term notes payable  maintain a maximum debt to tangible capital funds ratio of to  maintain minimum working capital of not less than million  maintain minimum cash on hand of not less than million  maintain a current ratio of not less than to  achieve earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization exceeding  and enter into a memorandum of understanding mou on december  with mse and textron among other members of the disd consortium regarding payment procedures under the master disd contract 
at december   we were in compliance with the loan covenants  and we anticipate that we will be able to comply with the loan covenants during the next twelve months 
if we violate any of the loan covenants  we would be required to seek waivers from textron and silicon valley bank a participating partner with textron for those non compliance events 
if textron or silicon valley bank refused to provide waivers  the amount due under the textron facility could be accelerated and we could be required to seek other sources of financing 
cash flows 
during  our cash increased by million 
operating activities used million  investing activities used million and financing activities provided million 
operating activities 
operating activities used million in as compared to using cash of million in and providing cash of  in adjustments for non cash related items included a  gain on disposal of discontinued operations  net of tax  due to collection of discontinued receivables previously reserved against as uncollectible 
an adjustment was also made to record minority interest of  depreciation and amortization of  current tax benefit of  and the loss on retirement of assets of  adjustments for non cash expenses included bad debt expense of million  which was attributable to increases in allowances for accounts and notes receivable that were partially offset by decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable due to the write off of uncollectible accounts 
changes in asset and liability accounts used million 
the most significant use related to an increase in accounts receivable of million  which was related primarily to increased revenue and the delayed payment of e rate funded accounts receivable associated with the sales to independent school districts and the administrative delays encountered at the school and libraries division sld which administers the e rate program on their behalf 
days sales outstanding increased days from days at december  to days at december  due to these delays 
adjustment for accounts receivable others was  in inventory increased  in as compared to an increase of  in and an increase of  in net working capital used for contracts in progress increased  due to an increase in cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings of  which was primarily related to an increase in the stratasoft custom projects in process at year end and a reduction in billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings of  in addition  notes receivable increased million due to more notes receivables being accepted from stratasoft customers 
these uses of cash were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of million  which related primarily to increased purchases of cisco products for sales by our inx subsidiary  an increase in accrued expenses of million primarily for sales commissions  a decrease in other assets of  primarily for return of bid deposits and reduction in prepaid insurance  and an increase of  in deferred revenue related to a sale of software to resellers with notes in excess of twelve months 
investing activities 
investing activities used million in compared to a use of  for and a use of  for our investing activities related to capital expenditures in all three years were primarily related to purchases of computer equipment and software  and to a lesser degree  leasehold improvements 
investing activities related to cash paid for acquisitions increased in due to the acquisition of digital precision by inx 
during the next twelve months  we do not expect to incur significant capital expenditures requiring cash  except for acquisitions  of which we cannot predict the certainty or magnitude 
financing activities 
financing activities provided million in as compared to providing million in and to using  in in and  our changes in stock price resulted in stock option holders exercising stock options  which provided  and  respectively 
no options were exercised during the previous two years 
during december  million of debt under the textron facility became interest bearing debt and was classified as notes payable rather than accounts payable 
during january  the company repaid million of interest bearing debt under the textron facility 
during the year ended december   another million of debt under the textron facility became interest bearing in march and was repaid in may  and during september through december another million became interest bearing 
on may  we closed a public offering of  units 
the units began trading on may   on the american stock exchange under the symbol isru each unit consists of two shares of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock at a price of 
the units were offered at a public offering price of per unit resulting in million of proceeds before additional offering expenses 
on june  the underwriters exercised their option to purchase  additional units to cover over allotments resulting in million of proceeds before additional offering expenses 
we paid million of offering expenses associated with the public offering resulting in net proceeds from the public offering of million 
we used the net proceeds of the offering primarily for working capital and to repay interest bearing debt 
future trends we expect revenue to continue to increase in for each of our three subsidiaries 
we expect inx will grow the most  but that inx s growth rate for will be less than its growth rate for excluding the impact of acquisitions that we might make during we believe inx s growth rate will slow somewhat from historical rates of growth primarily because we believe we have become the dominant provider of cisco based ip telephony solutions for our targeted types of customers in our current market of texas  which are customers with approximately to  employees 
we expect cisco based systems will continue to gain market share  and we expect our revenue growth in will be primarily the result of prior investments in increased sales and marketing programs 
we anticipate making one or more acquisitions during  which we expect would add additional inx revenue growth 
while we cannot predict the economic and industry trends with certainty  we continue to believe that the enterprise customer information and communications technology industries are continuing to rebound from the depressed market conditions that began in  the recovery from which was somewhat delayed by the iraq war 
we currently believe that events and circumstances point toward this trend of improving general market conditions will continue through we expect to be able to contain the growth of certain selling  general and administrative expenses somewhat  relative to revenue growth  as expected increases in revenue are spread over a somewhat fixed corporate administration expense base 
we have experienced no material impact of inflation and changing prices on net sales and income from continuing operations in the last three years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we attempt to manage our borrowings under the textron facility to minimize interest expense 
the interest rate of the textron facility is the prime rate plus see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
during the year ended december   the interest rates of borrowings under the textron facility ranged from to 
a one percent change in variable interest rates will not have a material impact on our financial condition
