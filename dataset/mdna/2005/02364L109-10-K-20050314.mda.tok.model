item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements provided under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those described under risk factors and included in other portions of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue and cost recognition including estimated medical claims  allowance for doubtful accounts  loss contracts  professional and general liability self insurance retention  other self funded insurance reserves  legal contingencies  impairment of intangible assets and goodwill  and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies are affected by its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue and cost recognition the company s contracts with correctional institutions are principally fixed price contracts with revenue adjustments for census fluctuations and risk sharing arrangements  such as stop loss provisions and aggregate limits for off site or pharmaceutical costs 
such contracts typically have a term of one to three years with subsequent renewal options and generally may be terminated by either party at will and without cause upon proper notice 
revenues earned under contracts with correctional institutions are recognized in the period that services are rendered 
cash received in advance for future services is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income when the service is performed 
revenues are calculated based on the specific contract terms and fall into one of three general categories fixed fee  population based  or cost plus a margin 
for fixed fee contracts  revenues are recorded based on fixed monthly amounts established in the service contract 
revenues for population based contracts are calculated either as a fixed fee adjusted using a per diem rate for variances in the inmate population from predetermined population levels or by a per diem rate times the average inmate population for the period of service 
for cost plus contracts  revenues are calculated based on actual expenses incurred during the service period plus a contractual margin 
normally  contracts will also include additional provisions which mitigate a portion of the company s risk related to cost increases 
off site utilization risk is mitigated in the majority of the company s contracts through aggregate pools for off site expenses  stop loss provisions  cost plus fee arrangements or  in some cases  the entire exclusion of off site service costs 
pharmacy expense risk is similarly mitigated in certain of the company s contracts 
typically under the terms of such provisions  the company s revenue under the contract increases to offset increases in specified cost categories such as off site expenses or pharmaceutical costs 
for contracts which include such provisions  the company recognizes the additional revenues that would be due from clients based on its estimates of applicable contract to date costs incurred as compared to the corresponding pro rata contractual limit for such costs 
because such provisions typically specify how often such additional revenue may be invoiced and require all such additional revenue to be ultimately settled based on actual expenses  the additional revenues are initially recorded as 
table of contents unbilled receivables until the time period for billing has been met and actual costs are known 
any differences between the company s estimates of incurred costs and the actual costs are recorded in the period in which such differences become known along with the corresponding adjustment to the amount of recorded additional revenues 
under all contracts  the company records revenues net of any estimated contractual allowances for potential adjustments resulting from a failure to meet performance or staffing related criteria 
if necessary  the company revises its estimates for such adjustments in future periods when the actual amount of the adjustment is determined 
revenues for the distribution of pharmaceutical and medical supplies are recognized upon delivery of the related products 
healthcare expenses include the compensation of physicians  nurses and other healthcare professionals including any related benefits and all other direct costs of providing the managed care including the costs of professional and general liability insurance and other self funded insurance reserves discussed more fully below 
the cost of healthcare services provided or contracted for are recognized in the period in which they are provided based in part on estimates  including an accrual for estimated unbilled medical services rendered through the balance sheet date 
the company estimates the accrual for unbilled medical services using actual utilization data including hospitalization  one day surgeries  physician visits and emergency room and ambulance visits and their corresponding costs  which are estimated using the average historical cost of such services 
an actuarial analysis is also prepared periodically by an independent actuary to evaluate the adequacy of the company s total accrual related to contracts which have sufficient claims payment history 
the analysis takes into account historical claims experience including the average historical costs and billing lag time for such services and other actuarial data 
additionally  the company s utilization management personnel perform a monthly review of inpatient hospital stays in order to identify any stays which would have a cost in excess of the historical average rates 
once identified  reserves for such stays are determined which take into consideration the specific facts of the stay 
actual payments and future reserve requirements will differ from the company s current estimates 
the differences could be material if significant adverse fluctuations occur in the healthcare cost structure or the company s future claims experience 
changes in estimates of claims resulting from such fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual claims payments are recognized in the period in which the estimates are changed or the payments are made 
in  and  the company recorded a decrease of approximately million and increases of approximately million and million  respectively  to its prior year claims liabilities as a result of differences between actual and estimated claims experience 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are stated at estimated net realizable value 
the company recognizes allowances for doubtful accounts to ensure receivables are not overstated due to uncollectibility 
bad debt reserves are established based on a variety of factors  including the length of time receivables are past due  significant one time events  discussions with clients and historical experience 
if circumstances change  estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted 
loss contracts the company accrues losses under its fixed price contracts when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company performs this loss accrual analysis on a specific contract basis taking into consideration such factors as future contractual revenue  projected future healthcare and maintenance costs  projected future stop loss insurance recoveries and each contract s specific terms related to future revenue increases as compared to increased healthcare costs 
the projected future healthcare and maintenance costs are estimated based on historical trends and management s estimate of future cost increases 
these estimates are subject to the same adverse fluctuations and future claims experience as previously noted 
on a quarterly basis  the company performs a review of its portfolio of contracts for the purpose of identifying loss contracts and developing a contract loss reserve for succeeding periods 
as a result of its fourth quarter review  the company identified five non cancelable contracts that  based upon management s projections  were expected to continue to incur negative gross margins over their remaining terms 
in december  the company recorded a charge of million to establish a reserve for future losses under these non cancelable contracts 
the five contracts covered by the charge had expiration dates ranging from june  through june  ninety percent of the charge related to the state of kansas department of corrections the kansas doc contract  which was to expire on june   and the city of philadelphia contract  which was renewable annually  at the client s option  through june  in june  the company and the city of philadelphia reached a mutual agreement that the contract between phs and the city of philadelphia would expire effective june  as a result of the earlier than anticipated expiration of this loss contract  the company recorded a gain of million  in the second quarter of  to reduce its reserve for loss contracts 
from july  to september   the company provided services to the city of philadelphia under a transition arrangement 
subsequent to september   the company is continuing to provide healthcare services to the city of philadelphia under modified contract terms 
during the quarter ended june   the company utilized its loss contract reserve at a rate greater than previously anticipated due to an unexpected increase in healthcare expenses associated with the company s contract to provide services to the kansas doc 
the primary causes for the increase in healthcare expenses in this contract were hospitalization and outpatient costs 
the company increased its reserve for loss contracts by million  as of june   to cover estimated future losses under the kansas doc 
table of contents contract  which was to expire in june this increase in the reserve for loss contracts is reflected as a component of income from discontinued operations  net of tax  in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
during the second and third quarters of  the company participated in active discussions with the kansas doc related to a proposal from the company that would significantly reduce the remaining length of the current contract 
in response to the proposal  the kansas doc solicited and received proposals from several other vendors to provide healthcare services to the kansas doc 
after the kansas doc s evaluation of the proposals from the other vendors  in august  the company began discussions with health cost solutions  inc hcs and the kansas doc related to a proposal pursuant to which hcs would assume the company s performance obligation under the kansas doc contract 
on august   the company entered into an assignment and novation agreement with the kansas doc to assign the kansas doc contract to hcs effective october  the company also entered into a general assignment  novation and assumption agreement with hcs to transfer the kansas doc contract to hcs  effective october  beginning october   hcs became solely responsible for the performance of the kansas doc contract  and the company has no obligation to the kansas doc or to hcs related to hcs performance of the contract  therefore the operating results of this contract have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented 
under the terms of the company s agreement with hcs  the company agreed to pay hcs net consideration of million in monthly installments  which commenced october  and will continue through june  as a result of the financial terms of the company s agreement with hcs  in the third quarter of  the company reclassified million of its reserve for loss contracts to accounts payable and recorded a gain of million  to reduce its reserve for loss contracts 
this decrease in the reserve for loss contracts is reflected as a component of income from discontinued operations  net of tax  in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the company s contract with the maryland department of public safety and correctional services maryland dps has historically underperformed  fluctuating between minimal profitability  breakeven and losses 
this contract was entered into on july   to provide comprehensive medical services to four regions of the maryland prison system 
the initial term of the contract was for the three years ended june   with the maryland dps having the ability to renew the contract for two additional one year terms 
the contract is presently in its second renewal term and is non cancelable by the company 
the maryland dps pays the company a flat fee per month with certain limited cost sharing adjustments for staffing costs  primarily nurses  and the cost of medications related to certain specific illnesses 
the company is fully at risk for increases in hospitalization and outpatient costs under the terms of the contract with the maryland dps 
the contract also contains provisions that allow the maryland dps to assess penalties if certain staffing or performance criteria are not maintained 
the flat fee paid to the company is increased annually based on a portion of the consumer price index 
due to the flat fee nature of this contract  the company s margin under the contract can be significantly impacted by changes in healthcare costs  utilization trends or inmate population 
the company incurred losses under this contract in april at a level slightly above expectations 
the losses under the contract increased significantly in may to approximately million for the month 
the primary cause for the increased loss was an unanticipated increase in hospitalization costs beginning in may  resulting from the volume and acuity of services being provided  the number of hiv and mental health patients and the costs associated with current treatment guidelines 
during the second quarter of  the company recorded a pre tax loss contract charge of million  effective june   which represented its most likely estimate  at that date  of the future losses and allocated corporate overhead under the maryland dps contract through its expiration on june  this estimate assumed monthly losses under the contract would diminish from the may level  which was viewed as an aberration  to approximately million per month  including allocated overhead  an amount significantly above recent historical levels 
during the third quarter of  the company utilized million of its loss contract reserve  almost entirely due to the underperformance of the maryland dps contract 
while actual monthly losses incurred under the maryland dps contract had trended downward from the record loss in may  losses once again increased in september  driven primarily by off site medical costs 
off site medical costs under the maryland dps contract averaged million per month for june through september  as compared with initial estimates of million per month  based on historical results 
as a result of this new and more severe trend  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million  effective september   to increase its reserve for estimated future losses and allocated corporate overhead under the maryland dps contract until its expiration in june a fundamental assumption of the million increase in loss reserve was that the contract would continue to incur on average million per month of off site medical costs through its termination on june  during the fourth quarter  the company utilized million of its loss contract reserve  which relates to the maryland dps and a county contract 
as of december   the company had a loss contract reserve totaling million 
while the company believes it is adequately reserved at present  there can be no assurance that in the course of performing its reviews in future periods  the company might revise its estimate of future losses related to the contracts currently identified as loss 
table of contents contacts 
it might also identify additional contracts which have become loss contracts due to a change in circumstances 
circumstances that might change and result in a revised estimate of future losses or the identification of a contract as a loss contract in a future period include unanticipated adverse changes in the healthcare cost structure  inmate population or the utilization of outside medical services in a contract  where such changes are not offset by increased healthcare revenues 
should the company identify circumstances that would result in a revision of its estimate of future losses for a loss contract  the company would  in the period in which the revision is made  increase or decrease the reserve for loss contracts 
should a contract be identified as a loss contract in a future period  the company would record  in the period in which such identification is made  a reserve for the estimated future losses that would be incurred under the contract 
a revision to a current loss contract or the identification of a loss contract in the future could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in the period in which the reserve is recorded 
professional and general liability self insurance retention as a healthcare provider  the company is subject to medical malpractice claims and lawsuits 
the most significant source of potential liability in this regard is the risk of suits brought by inmates alleging lack of timely or adequate healthcare services 
the company may also be liable  as employer  for the negligence of healthcare professionals it employs or the healthcare professionals it engages as independent contractors 
the company s contracts generally require it to indemnify the governmental agency for losses incurred related to healthcare provided by the company or its agents 
to mitigate a portion of this risk  the company maintains its primary professional liability insurance program  principally on a claims made basis 
however  due to the use of large deductibles in and the use of adjustable premium policies in  and the company is self insured for professional liability claims incurred under its primary program 
for  and  the company is covered by separate policies  each of which contains a month retro premium with adjustment based on actual losses after months 
the company s ultimate premium for its  and policies will depend on the final incurred losses related to each of these separate policy periods 
reserves for estimated losses related to known claims are provided for on an undiscounted basis using internal and external evaluations of the merits of the individual claims  analysis of claim history and the estimated reserves assigned by the company s third party administrator 
any adjustments resulting from the review are reflected in current earnings 
in  and  the company recorded increases of approximately million  million and million  respectively  to its prior year claims reserves as a result of adverse development 
the increase primarily relates to adverse development in eight claims 
in addition to its reserves for known claims  the company maintains a reserve for incurred but not reported claims 
the reserve for incurred but not reported claims is recorded on an undiscounted basis 
the company s estimates of this reserve are supported by an independent actuarial analysis  which is obtained on a periodic basis 
at december   the company s reserves for known and incurred but not reported claims totaled million 
reserves for medical malpractice claims fluctuate because the number of claims and the severity of the underlying incidents change from one period to the next 
furthermore  payments with respect to previously estimated liabilities frequently differ from the estimated liability 
changes in estimates of losses resulting from such fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual loss payments are recognized by an adjustment to the reserve for medical malpractice claims in the period in which the estimates are changed or payments are made 
the reserves can also be affected by changes in the financial health of the third party insurance carriers used by the company 
if a third party insurance carrier fails to meet its contractual obligations under the agreement with the company  the company would then be responsible for such obligations 
other self funded insurance reserves at december   the company has approximately million in accrued liabilities for employee health and workers compensation claims 
the company is essentially self insured for employee health and workers compensation claims subject to certain individual stop loss provisions 
as such  its insurance expense is largely dependent on claims experience and the ability to control claims 
the company accrues the estimated liability for employee health insurance based on its history of claims experience and the estimated time lag between the incident date and the date of actual claim payment 
the company accrues the estimated liability for workers compensation claims based on internal and external evaluations of the merits of the individual claims  analysis of claims history and the estimated reserves assigned by the company s third party administrator 
on a periodic basis  the company obtains an independent actuarial analysis to further support the appropriateness of the workers compensation reserves 
these estimates of self funded insurance reserves could change in the future based on changes in the factors discussed above 
any adjustments resulting from such changes in estimates are reflected in current earnings 
in  and  the company recorded an increase of approximately million and decreases of approximately million and million  respectively  to its prior year other self insurance reserves as a result of differences between actual and estimated claims experience 
legal contingencies in addition to professional and general liability claims  the company is also subject to other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business 
such proceedings generally relate to labor  employment or contract matters 
when estimable  the company accrues an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
such estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel 
table of contents handling the company s defense in these matters and is based upon an estimated range of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
the company does not believe any of the current proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position 
however  it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions  new developments or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with such litigation 
see discussion of certain outstanding legal matters in part i item legal proceedings 
intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas  goodwill acquired is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company performed its annual review as of december  based on the results of this annual review  management has determined that goodwill is not impaired as of december  future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s other identifiable intangible assets  such as customer contracts acquired in acquisitions and covenants not to compete  are amortized on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
the company also assesses the impairment of its other identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
important factors taken into consideration when evaluating the need for an impairment review include the following significant underperformance or loss of key contracts relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the company s assets or in the company s overall business strategy  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if the company determines that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment or as a result of its annual impairment review  any impairment is measured using a fair value based goodwill impairment test as required under the provisions of sfas fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenues 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
when the company determines that the carrying value of other intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  any impairment is measured using an estimate of the asset s fair value based on the projected net cash flows expected to result from that asset  including eventual disposition 
the company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its contract intangibles on at least a quarterly basis  taking into account new facts and circumstances  including its retention rate for acquired contracts 
if such facts and circumstances indicate the current estimated life is no longer reasonable  the company adjusts the estimated useful life on a prospective basis 
in the third quarter of  the company revised the estimated life of the contract intangibles  acquired in its acquisition of emsa  from years to years 
the revised life impacted contract intangibles with a gross value of million and  beginning october   resulted in an increase to annual amortization expense of million

 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 

table of contents the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into consideration such factors as historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
sfas no 
requires the company to record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
it further states forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
since december  and until june   the company maintained a valuation allowance equal to its net deferred tax assets after considering deferred tax assets that could be realized through offsets to existing taxable temporary differences 
based upon the company s results of operations since december   and its expected profitability in this and future years  the company concluded  effective june   that it is more likely than not that substantially all of its net deferred tax assets will be realized 
as a result  in accordance with sfas no 
 substantially all of the valuation allowance applied to such net deferred tax assets was reversed in the second quarter of reversal of the valuation allowance resulted in a non cash income tax benefit in the second quarter of totaling million 
this benefit represented the company s estimated realizable deferred tax assets  excluding those deferred tax assets that resulted from the exercise of employee stock options 
the reversal of the valuation allowance that related to the company s estimated realizable deferred tax assets resulting from the exercises of employee stock options totaled million and was recorded as a direct increase to additional paid in capital in the stockholders equity portion of the company s balance sheet as of june  at december   the company s valuation allowance of approximately million represents management s estimate of state net operating loss carryforwards which will expire unused 
the company establishes accruals for certain tax contingencies when  despite the belief that the company s tax return positions are fully supported  the company believes that certain positions will be challenged and a risk exists that the company s positions will not be fully sustained 
the tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  case law  and emerging legislation 
the company s tax contingency accruals are reflected as a component of accrued liabilities

recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin no 
this interpretation addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities when certain characteristics are present 
the company adopted the provisions of fin no 
effective january  such adoption did not impact the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on december   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and any compensatory discounts received by employees in connection with stock purchased under employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer appropriate 
sfas no 
r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
the company expects to adopt sfas no 
r on july  sfas no 
r permits the company to adopt its requirements using one of two methods  a modified prospective method or a modified retrospective method 
when applying the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and based 
table of contents on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
the modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits the company to restate  based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures  either all prior periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company plans to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note of the company s consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement may reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in for such excess tax deductions was million 
no amounts were recognized in the company s cash flows statements for and as the company had a deferred tax valuation allowance in those years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the consolidated financial statements of the company due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
the company s exposure to market risk is primarily related to changes in the variable interest rate under the capitalsource credit facility 
the capitalsource credit facility carries an interest rate based on the citibank na prime rate  subject to a minimum stated interest rate  therefore the company s cash flow may be affected by changes in the prime rate 
for the year ended december   a hypothetical change in the underlying interest rate would have had no effect on interest expense paid under the credit facility  as the resulting interest rate would have remained below the minimum stated interest rate 
interest expense represents and of the company s revenues  respectively  for the years ended december  and the company has no debt outstanding at december
