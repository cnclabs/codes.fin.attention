item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
introduction 
fonar was formed in to engage in the business of designing  manufacturing and selling mri scanners 
in  we formed a wholly owned subsidiary  health management corporation of america  also referred to as hmca  formerly known as us health management corporation  in order to expand into the physician and diagnostic management services business 
fonar s principal mri products are its stand up tm upright tm mri and fonar tm mri scanners 
the stand up tm mri allows patients to be scanned for the first time under weight bearing conditions 
the company has been aggressively seeking new sales and during fiscal and  respectively received orders for and stand up tm mri scanners 
the stand up tm mri is the only mri capable of producing images in the weight bearing state 
in fiscal  we received our first order for a tm mri scanner  bringing the total number of orders for our mri scanners to at tesla field strength  the stand up tm mri and fonar tm magnets are among the highest field open mri scanners in the industry  offering non claustrophobic mri together with high field image quality 
fonar s open mri scanners were the first high field strength mri scanners in the industry 
hmca commenced operations in july  and generates revenues from providing comprehensive management services  including development  administration  accounting  billing and collection services  together with office space  medical equipment  supplies and non medical personnel to its clients 
revenues are in the form of fees which are earned under contracts with mri facilities and physical rehabilitation practices 
since april  hmca no longer engages in the management of primary care medical practices 
on july   subsequent to the end of fiscal  hmca sold the portion of its business engaged in the management of physical therapy and rehabilitation practices 
for the fiscal years ended june   june   and  respectively  of hmca s revenues were derived from contracts with facilities and practices owned by dr 
raymond v 
damadian  the president of fonar and hmca and principal stockholder of fonar 
the agreements with the mri facilities are for one year terms which renew automatically on an annual basis  unless terminated 
the fees are based on the number of procedures performed and currently range from to per mri scan 
the fees are reviewed and if appropriate  adjusted on an annual basis by mutual agreement 
the agreements with the physical rehabilitation practices  which were executed in  provided for a term of years 
the fees were fixed monthly fees adjusted annually 
these agreements were terminated effective as of june   and new agreements were entered into with new practices with owners who have no affiliation with dr 
damadian  fonar or hmca 
these new agreements were assigned in connection with the sale of the portion of hmca s business managing physical therapy and rehabilitation practices 
historically  adjustments were made on the basis of changes in hmca s costs  plus a percentage of costs 
the monthly fees under these contracts with the physical rehabilitation practices ranged from approximately  to  critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue and related costs of revenue from sales contracts for our mri scanners  under the percentage of completion method 
under this method  we recognize revenue and related costs of revenue  as each sub assembly is completed 
amounts received in advance of our commencement of production are recorded as customer advances 
we recognize revenue from license agreements for our intellectual property over the shorter of the contractual life of the license or the estimated economic life 
for our current license agreement  we are recognizing revenue ratably over years 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of june   we recorded a valuation allowance which reduced our deferred tax assets to equal our deferred tax liability 
we amortize our intangible assets  including patents  purchased management agreements and capitalized software development costs  over the shorter of the contractual legal life or the estimated economic life 
our amortization life for patents  purchased management agreements and capitalized software development costs is to years  years and years  respectively 
we periodically assess the recoverability of long lived assets  including property and equipment  intangibles and management agreements  when there are indications of potential impairment  based on estimates of undiscounted future cash flows 
the amount of impairment is calculated by comparing anticipated discounted future cash flows with the carrying value of the related asset 
in performing this analysis  management considers such factors as current results  trends  and future prospects  in addition to other economic factors 
results of operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  we experienced net income of million on revenues of million  as compared to a net loss of million on revenues of million for fiscal this represents an increase in revenues of 
this was due in part to the fact that while revenues increased by  total costs and expenses increased by only 
our consolidated operating results improved by million to operating income of million for fiscal as compared to an operating loss of million for fiscal discussion of operating results of medical equipment segment fiscal compared to fiscal revenues attributable to our medical equipment segment increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting an increase in product sales revenues of  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and an increase in service revenue of  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this improvement in revenues was attributable to our increase in sales of our stand up tm mri  which is unique in that it permits mri scans to be performed on patients upright in the weight bearing state and in multiple positions that correlate with symptoms 
the increase in service revenue is a result primarily of our increase scanner base  as scanners sold in previous years become service customers after the warranty period expires 
during the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively  we received orders for and stand up tm mri scanners 
in addition to stand up tm mri scanners  we received our first order for a fonar tm scanner 
confirming our expectation of increased demand for our mri scanners  product sales to unrelated parties increased by in fiscal from million in fiscal to million in fiscal product sales to related parties increased by in fiscal from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we believe that one of our principal challenges in achieving greater market penetration is attributable to the better name recognition and larger sales forces of our larger competitors such as general electric  siemens  hitachi  philips and toshiba and the ability of some of our competitors to offer attractive financing terms through affiliates  such as ge capital 
nevertheless  no other competitor offers a whole body weight bearing mri scanner such as the stand up tm mri  and the general electric medical systems division of general electric acts as a manufacturer s representative for the stand up tm mri 
we believe that our continuing increase in unrelated party product sales shows that we are successfully meeting that challenge 
the operating results for the medical equipment segment improved by million from a loss of million in fiscal to an income of  in fiscal this improvement is attributable to our continuing increase in recognition of revenues on our scanner sales 
we recognized revenues of million from the sale of our stand up tm mri scanners and  from the sales of a fonar tm mri scanner in fiscal in fiscal  we recognized revenues of million from the sale of stand up tm mri scanners 
sales of mri scanners to related parties  consisting of professional corporations and other entities in which dr 
damadian or members of his family have an interest represented approximately  or million  of our revenues in fiscal  as compared to  or million  of our revenues in fiscal license and royalty revenue declined by to approximately million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal gross profit margins on product sales decreased during fiscal from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease is principally attributable to increased prices for steel and copper 
research and development expenses  net of capitalized costs  increased by to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal our expenses for fiscal represented continued research and development of fonar s scanners  fonar s new hardware and software product  sympulse tm and new surface coils to be used with the stand up tm mri scanner 
discussion of operating results of physician and diagnostic services management segment 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues attributable to the company s physician and diagnostic services management segment  hmca  increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in revenues reflected anticipated increases provided by upgraded facilities 
presently  eight of the mri facilities managed by hmca have stand up tm mri scanners and additional upgrades are planned 
cost of revenues as a percentage of the related revenues for our physician and diagnostic services management segment increased from million or of related revenues for the year ended june  to million  or of related revenue for the year ended june  operating results of this segment improved from an operating loss of  in fiscal to operating income of  in fiscal we attribute the improvement to hmca s focus on upgrading the more promising sites it manages such as the introduction of stand up tm mri scanners at mri facilities 
discussion of certain consolidated results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal we recognized interest income of  in as compared to  in fiscal  representing an increase of 
the increase was attributable primarily to an increase in interest rates on our investments in marketable securities 
interest expense of  was recognized in fiscal decreasing from  in fiscal and representing a decrease of 
the decrease was attributable primarily to the repayment of debt and capital lease obligations in fiscal notwithstanding that revenue increased by  selling  general and administrative expenses  exclusive of compensatory element of stock issuances  increased by only to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  accounting in part for our increase in net income 
this increase was related to expenses incurred in our medical segment related to marketing and customer relations programs  such as participating in a trade show  increased commissions  and an in house seminar for all owners of stand up mri tm scanners and increased professional fees 
a portion of the increased professional fees was related to the engagement of outside consultants to assist us in preparation of internal documentation in connection with our compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
in addition we incurred expenses in connection with the defense of non material litigation 
the decrease in compensatory element of stock issuances from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal reflected the continued but reduced use of fonar s stock bonus plans to pay certain highly compensated employees and others in stock rather than in cash 
the lower provision for bad debt of  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal  reflected a decrease in reserves and write offs of certain indebtedness 
the amortization expense of  in fiscal and fiscal  reflects the amortization of management agreements attributable to hmca s acquisitions 
we are enthusiastic about the future of our stand up tm mri and fonar tm scanners which bring a new plateau of openness to diagnostic mri and are expected to bring a new frontier in performing mri guided intervention 
we believe our new products are beginning to successfully penetrate the market  as reflected in the dramatic increase in product sales from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal  to million in fiscal  to million in fiscal  to million in fiscal and million in fiscal in addition to our success with our stand up tm mri  we sold our first fonar tm in the first quarter of fiscal service and repair fees also have steadily increased  as reflected by the increase in service and repair fees from million in fiscal to million in fiscal to million in fiscal to million in fiscal to million in fiscal and million in fiscal continuing our tradition as the originator of mri  we remain committed to maintaining our position as a leading innovator of the industry through aggressive investing in research and development 
in fiscal we continued our investment in the development of our new mri scanners  together with software and upgrades  with an investment of  in research and development   of which was capitalized  as compared to   of which was capitalized  in fiscal the research and development expenditures were approximately of revenues attributable to our medical equipment segment  and of total revenues  in and of medical equipment segment revenues  and of total revenues in fiscal this represented a increase in research and development expenditures in fiscal as compared to fiscal and our significantly higher total revenues and medical equipment revenues which have resulted from our greater emphasis on marketing and selling 
in summary  fonar continued the trend of steadily increasing mri scanner sales  most dramatically the increase in stand up tm mri scanner sales revenues from fiscal through fiscal we anticipate that increased scanner sales revenues will continue due to the unique capability of the stand up tm mri scanner to scan patients in weight bearing positions and future sales of the fonar tm for image guided interventional procedures and treatments 
service revenues have also increased over the past five fiscal years 
the physician and diagnostic services management segment  hmca  revenues also continued to increase  from million in fiscal to in fiscal and million in fiscal we have increased hmca revenues by closing unprofitable facilities and continuing our program of replacing the mri scanners at the mri facilities we manage with stand up tm mri scanners and opening new facilities equipped with stand up tm 
marketing expenditures are likely to increase  as the company continues its efforts to promote sales 
following the end of fiscal  hmca sold the portion of its business engaged in the management of physical therapy and rehabilitation facilities in july of to health plus management services  llc for a purchase price of million  payable pursuant to a promissory note in monthly installments 
the first twelve installments are interest only and the remaining payments will consist of equal installments of principal and interest in the amount of  each 
the note is secured by a first lien on all of the assets of health plus  including its accounts receivable 
the note is subject to prepayment provisions to the extent health plus resells all or part of the assets and business or utilizes the assets sold as collateral in any debt financing 
hmca had recognized revenue from the management of physical therapy and rehabilitation facilities of approximately million during both and in connection with this sale  hmca expects to recognize a diminimus loss during the quarter ended september  in addition  hmca will record a one time charge to earnings during the quarter ended september  of million related to the termination of the employment contracts discussed above
