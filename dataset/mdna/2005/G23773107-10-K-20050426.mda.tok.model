item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our objective is to provide water services in areas where the supply of potable water is scarce and where the use of ro technology to produce potable water is economically feasible 
in  we did this by continuing to integrate the expanded operations resulting from our acquisitions in in our retail operations  sales increased due to increased demand but were somewhat curtailed by hurricane ivan  which struck the cayman islands on september and  administrative expense of retail operations increased due to additional accounting controls now being enforced in our operations 
in our bulk operations  sales increased due to the current full year impact of the acquisitions 
our belize operations had increased demand but we experienced a significant increase in unscheduled maintenance and repair costs 
due to a change in operational management  we expect to reduce these costs in we also experienced some fouling of membrane elements in waterfields  which has limited the production of water and exposed us to penalties 
earnings from our equity affiliate increased  because of an increase in sales after our customer made significant repairs to its distribution system in the british virgin islands 
in our service operations  sales were reduced due to delays in obtaining construction projects and this resulted in an increase in non billable labour costs due to increased idle time 
we also experienced an increase in our maintenance costs related to our barbados operations 
by focusing on operations we have increased our share value and maintained dividend payouts 
to maintain this  we need to expand our revenues by developing new business opportunities both within our current service areas  and in new areas 
we also need to maintain our high operating efficiencies by executing our equipment maintenance and water loss mitigation programs 
we believe that many caribbean basin and adjacent countries  being water scarce  present opportunities for operation of our plants in regulatory environments which are less restrictive than the highly regulated markets of north america 
our business operations and activities after our acquisitions in are conducted in five countries the cayman islands  belize  barbados  the british virgin islands and the bahamas 
the acquisitions increased our daily water production capacity in the cayman islands and the bahamas and expanded our geographic presence to include barbados and the british virgin islands

critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to trade accounts receivable  goodwill and other intangible assets 
our company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and 
table of contents require management s more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our company s consolidated financial statements 
trade accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments 
management continuously evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and record allowances for doubtful accounts based on estimates of the level of actual write offs which might be experienced 
these estimates are based on  among other things  comparisons of the relative age of accounts and consideration of actual write off history 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess costs over fair value of the assets of an acquired business 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination accounted for as a purchase and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but are tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimatable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company periodically evaluates the possible impairment of goodwill 
management identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units 
the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit and compares it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  the company is required to perform the second step of the impairment test  as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired 
in this step  the company compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
if the implied fair value is less than its carrying amount  the impairment loss is recorded 
our annual tests resulted in no goodwill impairment 
net insurance recovery from hurricane ivan under generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to record the loss of any property  which must be replaced  in the period the loss occurs  and record any gain from the related insurance claim only when the recovery is probable 
we have estimated a loss of  consisting of plant and equipment of  spare parts inventories of  and costs relating to rebuilding the cayman islands operations of  these amounts have been recorded against the insurance recoveries and the result appears as an unusual gain on the income statement as net insurance recovery due to hurricane ivan 
the company also suffered loss of profits during the period that it was unable to sell water to its cayman islands customers 
the company has quantified this loss of profits at  this has been fully covered in the company s claim for such loss to its insurer under its loss of profits insurance policy 
we have accepted a final settlement from the insurance company of  towards claims for loss and damage to property and loss of profits resulting from hurricane ivan 
this amount has offset the loss of  at december    has been recorded as a receivable 
at the time of this filing  we have received  in cash  the entire amount recorded as insurance recovery receivable at december

results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue revenue increased by from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in 
table of contents revenue from our retail water retail operations increased by from  to  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
this increase is due to higher water sales in our primary market in the cayman islands  as a result of an increased demand in both our tourist volume and residential developments before hurricane ivan affected the cayman islands 
published tourist air arrival records are only available thru august these indicate a increase for the eight months ended august  over the same period in the prior year 
after hurricane ivan no overnight visitors were allowed on to the island until the end of november hurricane ivan reduced our budgeted cayman islands retail sales for september by more than half 
in the last half of september  our operations were operating at limited capacity  due to the damage to our plants and many of our retail customers were unable to take any water due to damage to their premises 
since hurricane ivan we have repaired our plants and are able to meet the demand with our current facilities 
the sales trends since the hurricane indicate that subsequent to hurricane ivan water sales were higher than anticipated due to the clean up efforts but december water sales in our tourist market were down and residential sales were down compared to december january sales trends indicate that water sales are reduced from january levels but more in line with results 
revenue from our bulk water bulk operations increased by from  to  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was primarily due to an additional month of revenue from our acquisition of ocean conversion cayman limited operations and seven months of revenue from our acquisition of waterfields company limited operations when compared to our bulk operations on the cayman islands were less affected by hurricane ivan than our cayman islands retail operations 
the sales volume is higher for the fourth quarter compared to the same period in revenues from our belize operations declined by during due to the reduced water rates in the new long term contract which was signed in and came into full effect on june  after all conditions precedent had been met or waived 
these reduced rates have been partially offset by reduced annual amortization costs on an intangible asset representing the belize water sale contract  which is now being amortized over years 
the new contract  however  made us the exclusive producer of potable water for our customer on ambergris caye for the term of the agreement 
revenue from services services decreased by from  to  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
all services revenues pertain to desalco limited and its wholly owned subsidiary desalco barbados ltd 
the decrease was due to fewer construction projects and the related decrease in engineering fees that are charged on labour and material costs associated with these projects 
during  we substantially completed our existing construction projects and have not commenced any new construction projects 
other income expenses total other income expenses increased by from income of  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was due to both decreased interest expense resulting from the repayment of our bridge loan facility on july  with proceeds from our equity offering and the associated reduction of amortization of financing costs from the prior year and increased profit sharing and equity income from our investment in ocean conversion bvi ltd 
the increase in our equity income from our investment in ocean conversion bvi ltd 
was due to increased sales 
in  we completed the expansion of this plant but were unable to increase sales 
table of contents due to damaged distribution equipment of our customer 
in  our customer has made significant repairs to its distribution system and continues to do so 
cost of sales total cost of sales increased by from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in during this same period  our total revenue increased by 
cost of sales of our retail operations increased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively  while our retail revenue increased by for the year ended december  this increase in cost of sales resulted primarily from additional variable costs related to the production of the additional water sold up to september  when hurricane ivan damaged our cayman island operations 
from that point until december  we produced significantly less water than last year but still incurred fixed operating costs 
cost of sales of our bulk operations increased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively  while our bulk revenue increased by for the same period 
this increase in cost of sales was due to an additional month of expenses from our ocean conversion cayman limited operations and an additional seven months of expenses from our waterfields company limited operations when compared to this increase also resulted from increased maintenance costs in our belize operations 
we have changed management and a number of other staff in our belize operations and are working successfully to reduce these unscheduled repair costs by improving the capabilities of our staff and preventative maintenance program 
cost of sales of our services reporting segment increased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was due to additional labour expense because of an increase in idle time resulting from reduced construction projects 
in addition  the increase in cost of sales is due to an additional month of operations from both desalco limited and its wholly owned subsidiary desalco barbados ltd 
our barbados operation also experienced increased maintenance when compared to  however  the necessary repairs have been made and we do not expect these problems to continue 
gross profit the gross profit margin increased from to for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in  for the reasons explained below 
gross profit margin for our retail operations increased from to for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in this increase is due to a decrease in our retail cost of sales resulting from i the cancellation of the governor s harbour plant operating contract in february  and ii higher production volumes from our cayman water production equipment to meet increased customer demand with no additional fixed overhead costs 
this increased was partially offset due to the effect of hurricane ivan  which limited our water sales for the last quarter  during which period we still incurred our fixed operational costs 
gross profit margin for our bulk operations increased from to for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in this increase is due to the addition of waterfields company limited  which is producing water at a higher gross margin than our other bulk operations 
the reason waterfields company limited is able to operate at a higher gross profit margin than some of our other bulk operations is because waterfields does not incur the amortization expense 
table of contents which our other bulk operations incur 
by comparison  various intangible assets were recognized in ocean conversion cayman limited when we acquired that company in february and in belize water limited when we acquired that company in september amortization expense of  and  was taken during each year ended december  and  respectively in our bulk operations 
we generally sell water to our bulk customers at a lower profit margin than to our retail customers 
gross profit margin for our services reporting segment decreased from to for the year ended december   when compared to the same period in primarily due to a relative decrease in revenue supporting the same level of fixed labour costs in addition  we carried out certain intermittent maintenance work in barbados 
general and administrative expenses total general and administrative expenses increased by from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in general and administrative expenses were at and of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses related or allocated to our retail operations increased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase is comprised of additional audit costs expensed in related to the work performed on the acquisitions  higher audit fees  legal and consulting fees related to sarbanes oxley internal control review process  increases in salaries and bonuses   additional administrative staff costs  increases in director fees and higher insurance premiums 
general and administrative expenses related or allocated to our bulk operations decreased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease is due to the reduction of our general and administrative expenses in ocean conversion cayman limited resulting from the assimilation of administrative functions of our cayman islands acquisition 
this was offset by additional expenses incurred by our waterfields company limited operations for bank and government fees relating to the exchange of bahamian dollars to us dollars  higher directors fees and expenses  and increased legal fees 
the increase was also the result of an additional seven months of expense from our waterfields company limited operations when compared to general and administrative expenses related or allocated to our services reporting segment decreased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in may  we closed our bermuda office and relocated operations to the cayman islands 
these decreases are the result of assimilation of the administrative functions of that office 
net insurance recovery from hurricane ivan on september and  hurricane ivan significantly affected our cayman islands operations 
as a result  we suffered damage to our seawater conversion plants 
five out of six of our seawater conversion plants suffered minor to moderate damage and our britannia plant suffered catastrophic damage 
based on our assessment  the britannia water production  post treatment and distribution equipment was a total loss and has been included in our insurance claim 
we are currently meeting all of our customers water demands without this plant in operation and expect to replace this 
table of contents equipment before the end of may we believe that our remaining production capacity will be sufficient to meet the needs of our customers until the production capacity of our britannia plant can be replaced 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to record the loss of any property  which must be replaced or now has a revised useful life  in the period the loss occurs  and record any gain from the related insurance claim only when the recovery is probable 
we have estimated a loss of  consisting of plant and equipment of  spare parts inventories of  and  relating to the rebuilding of the cayman islands operations as of december  these amounts have been recorded as part of income from operations as an unusual gain in the income statement as net insurance recovery due to hurricane ivan 
the company also suffered loss of profits during the period that we were unable to sell water to our cayman islands customers and we have quantified this loss of profits at  this has been fully covered as part of claim for such loss to our insurer under our loss of profits insurance 
we have accepted a final settlement from the insurance company of  offsetting our estimated loss of  net income net income increased by from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in dividends on january   we paid a dividend of to shareholders of record on december   on april   we paid a dividend of to shareholders of record on march   on july   we paid a dividend of to shareholders of record on june  and on october   we paid a dividend of to shareholders of record on september  we have consistently paid dividends to owners of our ordinary and redeemable preferred shares since we began declaring dividends in our board of directors has established a policy  but not a binding obligation  that we will seek to maintain a dividend pay out ratio in the range of to of net income 
while this policy is subject to modification by our board of directors  we expect to continue increasing our dividends if earnings grow 
our payment of any future cash dividends  however  will depend upon our earnings  financial condition  capital demand and other factors  including the condition in our loan agreement effective february   with scotiabank cayman islands ltd 
that dividends be paid only from current cash flows 
in october  waterfields company limited paid a dividend of bah per share to shareholders of record on september  on february   our board of directors declared an interim cash dividend of per share payable on april  to shareholders of record on march  year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue total revenue increased by from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in 
table of contents revenue from our retail water retail operations increased by from  to  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
sales in our primary market in the cayman islands were generally flat during the year  although we did experience an increase in sales of during the fourth quarter of over the same period in the prior year 
revenue from our bulk water bulk operations increased by from  to  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was due to our recent acquisitions of ocean conversion cayman limited and waterfields company limited and was slightly offset by a decrease in our bulk water sales in belize for the year ended december  revenue from services services was  for the year ended december  all services revenues pertain to our recent acquisition of desalco limited and its wholly owned subsidiary desalco barbados ltd 
other income expenses total other income expenses changed from an expense of  to income of  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in this increase was comprised of income and profit sharing from our equity investment in ocean conversion bvi ltd 
and was offset by interest expense related to the loan used to finance our recent acquisitions  amortization of bank fees and the early repayment fees paid on our loan from the european investment bank that was extinguished on june  we expect loan interest costs to decrease because a portion of the proceeds received from our completed equity offering was used to repay our scotiabank six month term loan on july  and we expect amortization of bank fees to decrease because we have fully amortized all fees relating to our bridge financing that was used to complete our recent acquisition 
cost of sales total cost of sales increased by from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in during this same period  our total revenue increased by 
cost of sales of our retail operations decreased by from  to  for the year ended december  and  respectively  while our retail revenue increased by for the year ended december  this decrease in cost of sales resulted primarily from the cancellation of the governor s harbour plant operating contract on february   which decreased our water purchase expense 
we expect our retail cost of sales going forward to remain at this lower percentage of retail revenues 
cost of sales of our bulk operations increased by from  to  for the year ended december  and  respectively  while our bulk revenue increased by for the same period 
this increase in cost of sales resulted almost entirely from the operating costs of ocean conversion cayman limited and waterfields company limited  which were consolidated in our accounts from february  and august  respectively 
it also includes the amortization costs of the intangible assets that were recognized in conjunction with our recent acquisition of ocean conversion cayman limited 

table of contents cost of sales of our services reporting segment were  for the year ended december  these relate to our recent acquisition of desalco limited and its wholly owned subsidiary desalco barbados ltd

gross profit overall gross profit margin decreased from to for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in  for the reasons explained below 
gross profit margin for our retail operations increased from to for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in the primary reason for this increase is that our retail cost of sales decreased as a result of the cancellation of the governor s harbour plant operating contract 
gross profit margin for our bulk operations decreased from to for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in in  we incurred additional direct costs in our belize bulk operations for leasing a temporary potable reverse osmosis unit  which we operated to meet our customer s water demand while we carried out maintenance on our permanent reverse osmosis units 
we ceased using the plant on september  and we do not expect to incur costs for this plant beyond april we generally sell water to our bulk customers at a lower profit margin than to our retail customers

we expect to reduce general and administrative expenses as we continue to assimilate the administrative functions of our recent acquisitions 

table of contents net income net income increased by from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in we expect future net income to be positively affected because  interest expense decreased after we repaid the bridge financing using the proceeds from our recent equity offering and we fully amortized the bank fees related to this bridge financing on july  we also anticipate that general and administrative expenses will decrease as we continue to assimilate our recent acquisitions 
dividends on january   we paid a dividend of to shareholders of record on december   on april   we paid a dividend of to shareholders of record on march   on july   we paid a dividend of to shareholders of record on june  and on october   we paid a dividend of to shareholders of record on september  we have consistently paid dividends to owners of our ordinary and redeemable preferred shares since we began declaring dividends in our board of directors has established a policy  but not a binding obligation  that we will seek to maintain a dividend pay out ratio in the range of to of net income 
while this policy is subject to modification by our board of directors  we expect to continue increasing our dividends  if our earnings grow 
our payment of any future cash dividends  however  will depend upon our earnings  financial condition  capital demand and other factors  including the condition in our new loan agreement effective february   with scotiabank cayman islands ltd 
that dividends be paid only from current cash flows

cash flow is dependent upon the timely receipt of customer payments  operating expenses  the timeliness and adequacy of rate increases excluding automatic adjustments to our rates for inflation and electricity costs  and various factors affecting tourism in the areas we operate such as weather conditions and the world economy 
we use cash to fund our various business segments in the cayman islands  belize  barbados and the bahamas  to fund capital projects  to expand our infrastructure  to pay dividends  to repay borrowings  to repurchase our shares when appropriate and to take advantage of new investment opportunities which expand operations 
operating activities cash generated from operating activities for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively

table of contents efficiencies created by our management team 
in  we also generated cash from the collection of a partial payment from our insurance claim but this was partially offset by payments to make the necessary repairs to damaged assets 
after hurricane ivan struck the island in september we did not bill our retail customers in grand cayman at the end of september  and issued bills in early november for the period of september and october additionally some of our customers suffered damage to their commercial and residential premises  which caused metered water to be lost within these premises 
we also did not carry out our normal disconnection procedures until january consequently  the receivables for our cayman islands retail operations were unusually high at year end 
we have been working with customers to settle any outstanding accounts and believe that an adequate provision has been made in our financial statements for amounts we believe to be uncollectible

impact of inflation under the terms of our cayman islands license and our water sales agreements in belize  bahamas  british virgin islands and barbados  our water rates are automatically adjusted for inflation on an annual basis  subject to temporary exceptions

table of contents forward looking statements we discuss in this annual report matters which are not historical facts  but which are forward looking statements 
we intend these forward looking statements to qualify for safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  our future plans  objectives  expectations and events  assumptions and estimates about our company and our industry in general 
the forward looking statements in this annual report reflect what we currently anticipate will happen 
what actually happens could differ materially from what we currently anticipate will happen 
we are not promising to make any public announcement when we think forward looking statements in this annual report are no longer accurate whether as a result of new information  what actually happens in the future or for any other reason 
important matters that may affect what will actually happen include  but are not limited to tourism and weather conditions in the areas we service  our ability to manage  integrate and realize the benefits from recent acquisitions  scheduled new construction within our operating areas  the economies of the us and the areas we service  regulatory matters  availability of capital to repay a substantial portion of our bank debt and for expansion of our operations  and other factors described in the risk factors section below as well as elsewhere in this annual report 
prior to commencing construction on the blue hills and windsor plants  the company must negotiate a definitive agreement with the water and sewerage corporation of the bahamas and obtain financing for the projects  which we anticipate will consist of million of debt and million of equity 
no assurances can be made that the company will be able to obtain financing at all or that the available financing opportunities will be on terms acceptable to the company 
risk factors we have described for you below some risks which may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our exclusive license for our service area in the cayman islands may not be renewed in the future and requires that we obtain prior approval for any rate increase for reasons other than inflation 
in the cayman islands  we presently operate as a public water utility under an exclusive license originally issued to us in december by the government of the cayman islands 
our existing license expires on july  if we are not in default of any terms of the license  we have a right of first refusal to renew the license on terms that are no less favorable than those which the government offers to a third party 
nevertheless  we cannot assure you that the government will renew our license or that we will be able to negotiate a new license on satisfactory terms 
we would retain ownership of our production infrastructure and substantially all of our distribution infrastructure if our license were not renewed 
under our existing license  we must obtain prior approval from the cayman islands government to increase our rates for any reason other than inflation 
our ability to raise our rates is limited by this requirement  including potential delays and costs involved in obtaining government approval for a rate increase 
failure to obtain adequate rate increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents we rely on water supply and or service agreements with our customers in the cayman islands  belize  the bahamas and barbados which  upon their expiration  may not be renewed or may be renegotiated on less favorable terms to us 
we presently operate as bulk water suppliers under water sales agreements in the cayman islands with our customer the water authority cayman  in belize with our customer  the belize water services limited  in the bahamas with our customers  the water sewerage corporation and south bimini international ltd 
we presently operate a plant in barbados under a service agreement for our customer sandy lane properties ltd 
upon expiration  these agreements may not be renewed or may be renewed on less favorable terms 
we are currently negotiating with our customer water authority cayman for an extension of one of our operating agreements for the lower valley seawater reverse osmosis plant the lower valley agreement  which expires in march for the year ended december   revenue from the lower valley agreement was  ocean conversion bvi ltd 
s water supply agreement with bviw s  which had an original term of seven years  has been in force on a monthly basis since january  our service agreement with sandy lane properties ltd 
expires in january and we are currently not in negotiations to extend this agreement  although we intend to make a proposal to our customer to renew the agreement at some later date 
for the year ended december   revenue from sandy lane properties ltd 
was  our other water supply agreements expire between november and march the british virgin islands water and sewerage department has taken the position that our water supply agreement is operating on a month to month basis 
we have accepted the position of the british virgin islands water and sewerage department that ocean conversion bvi ltd 
s existing water supply arrangement the british virgin islands is in force on a month to month basis until negotiations for a definitive agreement are finalized 
in may  the british virgin islands government did not make a required buyout payment of million for the baughers bay plant and has taken the position that the water supply agreement continues on a month to month basis 
thus  it is possible  but in our opinion unlikely  that the government could cease purchasing water at any time 
while ocean conversion bvi ltd 
has made attempts in the past to negotiate a new water supply agreement  there is no guarantee such agreement will be obtained  or if obtained  would be on terms favorable to ocean conversion bvi ltd 
cessation of the government water purchases  or failure to negotiate a new agreement on terms favorable to us  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
for the year ended december   net income of our affiliate ocean conversion bvi ltd 
was  of which  was recorded as equity in earning of affiliate on our consolidated statements of income 
our equity investment in ocean conversion bvi ltd  as at december   was  in the event that the government ceased purchasing water from the baughers bay plant  or we negotiated a new contract with the government on less favorable terms than the existing supply arrangement  we would be required to examine this investment for impairment 
in the event that we determined that this investment was impaired  we could incur significant expense to write off part or all of this investment  which would reduce our earnings during the period in which the investment was determined to be impaired 
termination of our exclusive distributorship agreement with dweer technology ltd 
would eliminate one competitive advantage that we presently have over our competition in obtaining new plants in the caribbean basin 
our wholly owned subsidiary  desalco limited  is currently the exclusive distributor in the caribbean basin for the dweer system produced by dweer technology ltd 
for use in reverse osmosis seawater desalination plants 
as a result  none of our competitors are able to offer this technology when bidding for new reverse osmosis seawater desalination plants in the caribbean basin 
as the dweer system is one of the most energy efficient recovery systems of its kind  the distributorship agreement with dweer technology ltd 
gives us a unique 
table of contents competitive advantage 
if the distributorship agreement were terminated or not renewed on equally favorable terms  we would lose this competitive advantage  and it may be more difficult for us to obtain new contracts for plants in the caribbean basin 
the costs of integrating future assets may affect our ability to pay dividends 
we have historically sought to pay cash dividends to our shareholders out of our net income on a quarterly basis if funds are available 
the costs associated with integrating future assets into our company  however  may reduce our net income 
if our net income is reduced  we will have fewer funds available to pay dividends 
in addition  our bank loan agreement with scotiabank cayman islands ltd 
requires that we pay dividends from current cash flows 
our business is affected by tourism  weather  the economies of the locations where we provide service and the us and european economies 
tourist arrivals and weather within our operating areas affect the demand for our water to a greater extent in the cayman islands and in belize than in the bahamas  the british virgin islands and barbados 
in the cayman islands and belize  the highest demand is normally in the first two quarters of each calendar year 
the lowest demand for water occurs in the third quarter of each calendar year 
a significant percentage of tourists visiting the cayman islands and belize come from the us or certain european countries 
in addition  development activity in our service areas in the cayman islands is significantly impacted by the us economy 
accordingly  a significant downturn in tourist arrivals to the cayman islands or in the us or european economies for any reason would be detrimental to our revenues and operating results 
additional terrorist activities in the united states  europe or in areas served by us or extended hostilities in the persian gulf would likely have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
the blue hills plant is larger than any other single desalination plant that we have built previously and revenue from this plant is substantially derived from fixed unit prices 
because of the size of the blue hills project  there are inherent uncertainties in our cost estimates to construct this project 
construction and or operating cost overruns could materially affect the return on our investment in this project 
additionally  the terms of the blue hills contract require us to guarantee the price of desalinated water on a per unit basis  subject to certain annual inflation adjustments  and assume the risk that the costs associated with producing this water may be greater than anticipated 
the profitability of this project is therefore dependent on our ability to estimate accurately the costs of constructing and operating the blue hills plant 
these costs may be affected by a variety of factors  such as changes in the costs of materials and services since we submitted our bid in march  lower than anticipated production efficiencies and or hydrogeological conditions at the plant site differing materially from what was evaluated at the time we bid on the contract 
if we did not estimate accurately the costs of the blue hills contract  this project could have lower margin than expected  which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
we may have difficulty accomplishing our growth strategy within and outside of our current operating areas 
even though we have an exclusive license for our present operating area in the cayman islands and supply agreements in the cayman islands  the bahamas  the british virgin islands  barbados and belize  our ability to expand our operating areas is often subject to the approval of the respective governments in each location 
further  part of our long term growth strategy is to expand our water supply and distribution operations to other locations outside of the cayman islands  the bahamas  barbados  the british virgin islands and belize 
our expansion into new locations depends on our ability to obtain necessary permits  licenses and approvals to operate in new territories 
we may not obtain these necessary permits  licenses and approvals in a timely and cost efficient manner  or at all 
our expansion to territories outside of our current operating areas includes significant risks  including  but not limited to  the following regulatory risks  including government relations difficulties  local regulations and currency controls  risks related to operating in foreign countries  including political instability  reliance on local economies  environmental or geographical problems  shortages of materials  immigration restrictions and limited skilled labor  risks related to development of new operations  including assessing the demand for water  engineering difficulties and inability to begin operations as scheduled  and risks relating to greater competition in these new territories  including the ability of our competitors to gain or retain market share by reducing prices 

table of contents even if our expansion plans are successful  we may have difficulty managing our growth 
we cannot assure you that any new operations outside of our current operating areas will attain or maintain profitability or that the results from these new operations will not negatively affect our overall profitability 
we do not own a majority interest in ocean conversion bvi ltd 
we own of the voting shares of ocean conversion bvi ltd  which allows us to appoint three of the six directors of that company 
sage water holdings bvi limited  which owns the remaining of the voting shares  is entitled to appoint the remaining three directors 
if there is a tied vote of the directors on any matter  the president of the caribbean water and wastewater association is entitled to appoint a temporary director to break the tie 
as a result  we have to share the management of ocean conversion bvi ltd 
with sage water holdings bvi limited 
although we provide management and engineering services to ocean conversion bvi ltd 
we do not fully control the operations of the company 
our operations in the caribbean could be harmed by hurricanes 
another significant hurricane such as hurricane ivan  which affected our cayman islands operations in september  could cause major damage to our equipment and properties and the properties of our customers  including the large tourist properties in these areas 
this would result in decreased revenues and profits from water sales until our damaged equipment and properties are repaired and our customers and the tourism industry returned to the status quo before the hurricane 
we insure all of our assets except for our feed wells and  in the cayman islands our underground water distribution system 
contamination to our processed water may cause disruption in our services and adversely affect our revenues 
our processed water may become contaminated by naturally occurring or man made compounds and events 
in the event that a portion of our processed water is contaminated  we may have to interrupt the supply of that water until we are able to install treatment equipment or substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water production source 
in addition  we may incur significant costs in order to treat a contaminated source of plant feed water through expansion of our current treatment facilities  or development of new treatment methods 
our inability to substitute processed water from an uncontaminated water source  or to adequately treat the contaminated plant feed water in a cost effective manner may have an adverse effect on our revenues 
in addition  in the wake of the september  terrorist attacks in new york  washington  dc and pennsylvania  we have taken steps to heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply 
while we are not aware of any specific threats to our facilities  operations or supplies  we have and will continue to take security precautions to protect our facilities  operations and supplies 
it is possible  however  that we would not be in a position to control the outcome or the costs of such events should they occur  which could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations 
we could be negatively affected by potential government actions and regulations 
any government that regulates our operations may issue legislation or adopt new regulations  including but not limited to restricting foreign ownership of our company  providing for the expropriation of our assets by the government  providing for nationalization of public utilities by the government  providing for different water quality standards  
table of contents resulting in unilateral changes to or renegotiation of our exclusive licenses  or causing currency exchange fluctuations or devaluations or changes in tax laws 
we rely on the efforts of several key employees 
our success depends upon the abilities of our executive officers 
in particular  the loss of the services of jeffrey parker  our chairman of the board  or fredrick mctaggart  our president and chief executive officer  could be detrimental to our operations and our continued success 
although messrs 
parker and mctaggart have entered into three year employment agreements  which may be extended every year for an additional one year term  we cannot guarantee that mr 
parker or mr 
mctaggart will continue to work for us during the term of their agreements 
in addition to messrs 
parker and f 
mctaggart  all of our vice presidents have entered into non compete agreements with us 
provisions in our articles of association and an option deed adopted by our board of directors may discourage a change in control of our company and may make it more difficult for you to sell your ordinary shares 
our articles of association include provisions  which may discourage or prevent a change in control of our company 
for instance  our board of directors consists of three groups 
each group serves a staggered term of three years before the directors in the group are up for re election 
also  our board of directors may refuse to register any transfer of shares on our books for any reason 
we have also adopted an option deed  which is similar to a poison pill 
the option deed will discourage a change in control of our company by causing substantial dilution to a person or group who attempts to acquire our company on terms not approved by the board of directors 
the option deed will expire on july  as a result of these provisions  which discourage or prevent an unfriendly or unapproved change in control of our company  our shareholders may not have an opportunity to sell their ordinary shares at a higher market price  which  at least temporarily  typically accompanies attempts to acquire control of a company through a tender offer  open market purchase or otherwise 
there may be a risk of variation in currency exchange rates 
although we report our results in united states dollars  the majority of our revenue is earned in cayman islands dollars  belizean dollars  bahamian dollars and barbados dollars 
all of the currencies in our operating areas have been fixed to the united states dollar for over years 
as a result  we do not intend to hedge against any exchange rate risk associated with our reporting in united states dollars 
if any of these fixed exchange rates becomes a floating exchange rate  however  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
service of process and enforcement of legal proceedings commenced against us in the united states may be difficult to obtain 
service of process on our company and our directors and officers  twelve out of sixteen of whom reside outside the united states  may be difficult to obtain within the united states 
also  since substantially all of our assets are currently located outside the united states  any judgment obtained in the united states against us may not be collectible 
there is no reciprocal statutory enforcement of foreign judgments between the united states and the cayman islands  so foreign judgments originating from the united states are not directly enforceable in the cayman islands 
a prevailing party in a united states proceeding against us or our officers or directors would have to initiate a new proceeding in the cayman islands using the united states judgment as evidence of the party s claim 
a prevailing party could rely on the summary judgment procedures available in the cayman islands  subject to available defenses in the cayman islands courts  including  
table of contents but not limited to  the lack of competent jurisdiction in the united states courts  lack of due service of process in the united states proceeding and the possibility that enforcement or recognition of the united states judgment would be contrary to the public policy of the cayman islands 
depending on the nature of damages awarded  civil liabilities under the securities act of or the securities exchange act of for original actions instituted outside the cayman islands may or may not be enforceable 
for example  a united states judgment awarding remedies unobtainable in any legal action in the courts of the cayman islands for example  treble damages  which would probably be regarded as penalties  would not likely be enforceable under any circumstances 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk credit risk we are not exposed to significant credit risk on retail customer accounts in the cayman islands  and bimini  bahamas  as our policy is to cease supply of water to customers whose accounts are more than days overdue 
our primary exposure to credit risk is from bulk water sales customers in belize  the bahamas  the british virgin islands  barbados and the cayman islands 
in addition  the entire balance of our loan receivable is due from the water authority cayman 
interest rate risk as of december   we had loans outstanding totaling  all of which bear interest at various lending rates such as libor  cayman island s prime rate or nassau prime rate 
we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent that any of these lending rates change 
foreign exchange risk all of our foreign currencies have fixed exchanged rates to the us dollar 
if any of these fixed exchange rates become a floating exchange rate  however  our results of operation could be adversely affected
