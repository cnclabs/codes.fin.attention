executive overview our principal objective is to grow our business in selected markets in latin america by providing differentiated  high value wireless communications services to business customers  while improving profitability and cash flow 
we intend to continue growing our business in a measured fashion  with a primary focus on generating earnings growth and free cash flow and maintaining appropriate controls on costs and capital expenditures 
we will seek to add subscribers at rates which do not negatively impact our operating metrics 
we may also explore financially attractive opportunities to expand our network coverage in areas where we currently do not provide wireless service 
based on the low wireless penetration in our markets and our current market share in our target customer segment  we believe that we can continue our current subscriber and revenue growth trends while improving our profitability 
we believe we will be successful in meeting our objective by focusing on major business centers in key latin american markets 
we operate primarily in large urban markets in latin america that have a concentration of high usage business customers 
we target these markets because we believe they offer favorable long term growth prospects for our wireless communications services 
the cities in which we operate account for a high proportion of total economic activity in each of their respective countries and provide us with a large potential market without the need to build out nationwide wireless coverage 
we believe that there are significant opportunities for growth in these markets due to relatively low overall wireless penetration rates and the large number of target business customers 
targeting high value business customers 
we focus on high end  post paid customers  targeting primarily businesses because they value our multi function handsets and our high level of customer service 
our typical customers have between and handsets  while some of our largest customers have over handsets under contract 
we believe that our focus on these business customers is a key reason why we have a significantly higher monthly average revenue per unit than reported by our competitors 
providing differentiated services 
we have traditionally been the only wireless service provider in mexico  peru and brazil that offers digital mobile telephone service and push to talk digital radio communication  fully integrated in a single wireless device in  among and throughout our service areas in each of these countries 
our unique direct connect push to talk service provides significant value to our customers by eliminating the long distance and domestic roaming fees charged by other wireless service providers  while also providing added functionality due to the near instantaneous nature of the communication and the ability to communicate on a one to many basis 
our competitors have begun to introduce competitive poc push to talk over cellular products  but we believe that the quality of our direct connect service is superior at this time 
we add further value by customizing data applications that enhance the productivity of our business customers  such as vehicle and delivery tracking  order entry processing and workforce monitoring applications 
we also provide international direct connect service  in conjunction with nextel communications  nextel partners and telus  which allows subscribers to communicate instantly across national borders with our subscribers in mexico  brazil  argentina and peru and with nextel communications and nextel partners subscribers in the united states and telus subscribers in canada 
delivering superior customer service 
in addition to our unique service offerings  we seek to further differentiate ourselves by providing a higher level of customer service generally than our competitors 
we work proactively with our customers to match them with service plans offering greater perceived value 
after analyzing customer usage and expense data  we strive to minimize a customer s per minute costs while increasing his overall usage of our array of services  thereby providing higher value to our customers while increasing our monthly revenues 
this goal is also furthered by our efforts during and after the sales process to educate customers about our services  multi function handsets and rate plans 
in addition  we have implemented proactive customer retention and customer for life programs to increase customer satisfaction and retention 
we believe that many of our competitors  who have primarily lower revenue generating prepaid customer bases  do not generally offer the same level of service to customers 
selectively expanding our service areas 
we believe that we have significant opportunities to grow through selective expansion of our service into additional areas within the countries in which we currently operate 
such expansion may involve building out certain areas in which we already have spectrum  obtaining additional mhz spectrum in new areas which would enable us to expand our network service areas  and further developing our business in key urban areas along the us mexico border 
in addition  we may consider selectively expanding into other latin american countries where we do not currently operate 
as a result of the spectrum that we won in the march spectrum auctions in mexico  we plan to significantly expand our service areas in mexico over the next several years and increase our covered population from about million to about million 
see capital expenditures for a discussion of the factors that drive our capital spending 
foreign currency exposure nearly all of our revenues are denominated in non us currencies  although a significant portion of our capital and operating expenditures  including imported network equipment and handsets  and substantially all of our outstanding debt  are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  fluctuations in exchange rates relative to the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on our earnings or assets 
for example  the economic upheaval in argentina in led to the unpegging of the argentine peso to the us dollar exchange rate and the subsequent significant devaluation of the argentine peso 
as a result  we recognized significant foreign currency transaction losses in argentina in and our revenues and earnings were significantly adversely affected 
any depreciation of local currencies in the countries in which our operating companies conduct business may also result in increased costs to us for imported equipment and may  at the same time  decrease demand for our products and services in the affected markets 
additional information regarding the impact of weakening currency rates is included in the discussion of our segments under results of operations 
recent developments convertible notes issuance 
in january  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due  which we refer to as our notes 
in addition  we granted the initial purchaser an option to purchase up to an additional million principal amount of notes  which was exercised in full in february as a result  we issued an additional million aggregate principal amount of notes  resulting in total net proceeds of million 
our notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured debt 
historically  some of our long term debt has been secured and may be secured in the future 
in addition  since we conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries  our notes effectively rank junior in right of payment to all liabilities of our subsidiaries 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per year  payable semi annually in arrears and in cash on february and august of each year  beginning august  the notes will mature on february   when the entire principal balance of million will be due 
the noteholders have the right to require us to repurchase the notes on february of    and at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to but excluding the repurchase date 
in addition  if a fundamental change or termination of trading  as defined  occurs prior to maturity  the noteholders have a right to require us to repurchase all or part of the notes at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  into shares of our common stock at a current conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  which is equivalent to a conversion price of about per share 
the conversion rate is subject to adjustments upon the occurrence of certain specific events 
the notes are convertible at any time prior to the close of business on the final maturity date under any of the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter commencing after march   if the closing sale price of our common stock exceeds of the then conversion price for at least trading days in the consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter  during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per note for each day of this period was less than of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of  principal amount of the notes subject to certain limitations  if the notes have been called for redemption by us  or upon the occurrence of specified corporate events 
we have the option to satisfy the conversion of the notes in shares of our common stock  in cash or a combination of both 
as of december   our convertible notes did not meet any of the criteria necessary for conversion into shares of our common stock 
the conversion rate of the notes is subject to adjustment if any of the following events occurs we issue common stock as a dividend or distribution on our common stock  we issue to all holders of common stock certain rights or warrants to purchase our common stock  we subdivide or combine our common stock  we distribute to all holders of our common stock shares of our capital stock  evidences of indebtedness or assets  including cash or securities but excluding the rights  warrants  dividends or distributions specified above  we or one of our subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for our common stock to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of common stock exceeds the current market price per share of common stock on the trading day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to this tender or exchange offer  or someone other than us or one of our subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer in which  as of the closing date of the offer  our board of directors is not recommending the rejection of the offer  subject to certain conditions 
on or after february   we may redeem for cash some or all of the notes for a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed  plus any accrued and unpaid interest including additional amounts  if any 
neither we  nor any of our subsidiaries  are subject to any financial covenants under our notes 
in addition  the indenture governing our notes does not restrict us or any of our subsidiaries from paying dividends  incurring debt  or issuing or repurchasing our securities 
stock split 
on february   we announced a for common stock split which was effected in the form of a stock dividend that was paid on march  to holders of record as of march  all share and per share amounts in this annual report on form k related to nii holdings  inc for the period from and after november   which we refer to as our successor company  have been updated to reflect the common stock split 
repayment of international equipment facility 
in february  in compliance with our international equipment facility credit agreement  we prepaid  at face value  million of the million in outstanding principal and related accrued interest of million 
we did not realize a gain or loss on this prepayment 
in july  we paid the remaining million in outstanding principal and related accrued interest under our international equipment facility 
under the terms of the international equipment facility and related agreements  motorola credit corporation was a secured creditor and held senior liens on substantially all of our assets  as well as the assets of our various foreign and domestic subsidiaries and affiliates 
as a result of the extinguishment of this facility  motorola credit corporation released its liens on these assets  all restrictive covenants under this facility were terminated and all obligations under this facility were discharged 
we did not recognize any gain or loss as a result of any of these transactions 
in addition  prior to the extinguishment of this facility  motorola credit corporation owned one outstanding share of our special director preferred stock  which gave motorola credit corporation the right to nominate  elect  remove and replace one member of our board of directors 
mr 
charles f 
wright  one of the directors on our board  was elected by motorola through these rights under the special director preferred stock 
in connection with the repayment of this facility  mr 
wright resigned as a member of our board of directors on september   and the preferred stock held by motorola credit corporation was automatically terminated 
repurchase and defeasance of senior secured discount notes 
in march  nii holdings cayman  ltd 
nii cayman  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  retired substantially all of its million aggregate principal amount senior secured discount notes due through a cash tender offer at a premium over par  resulting in a million pre tax loss  including a million write off of the unamortized discount and million in charges representing the write off of debt financing costs and the payment of transaction costs 
nii cayman financed this tender offer with intercompany loans from nii holdings and cash on hand 
we used a portion of our proceeds from the issuance of our notes to fund these intercompany loans to nii cayman 
in july  the trustee for our senior secured discount notes due released its security interests in the underlying collateral  and the remaining amount under these notes was defeased 
as a result  our assets are no longer pledged as collateral under these notes 
income taxes 
during  we reversed million of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a reduction to intangible assets existing at our emergence from reorganization in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  or sop   financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code 
since these valuation allowances existed as of the date of the application of fresh start accounting  we recorded the reversals as a reduction to our remaining intangible assets existing at emergence from reorganization 
we recorded the reversal of valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets generated subsequent to our reorganization as a tax benefit in the amount of million during we continued to assess the realizability of certain deferred tax assets throughout the first three quarters of consistent with the methodology employed during during the first quarter of  we reversed valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets in mexico due to additional information regarding our expected profitability within certain mexican operations 
we did not reverse any deferred tax asset valuation allowance during the second or third quarters of during the fourth quarter of  we expanded the analysis of future projections that we performed in our assessment due to an additional year of profitability in as a result of our assessment  we reversed deferred tax asset valuation allowances in mexico  argentina and peru 
in accordance with sop  we recorded the reversals of valuation allowances that existed as of the date of the application of fresh start accounting first as a reduction to our intangible assets existing at emergence from reorganization until fully exhausted and then as an increase to paid in capital 
we recorded reversals of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets created after emergence from reorganization as an income tax benefit 
the following table reflects the impact of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance reversals that we recorded during on our intangible assets  stockholders equity and income tax provision three months ended three months ended year ended march  december  december  in thousands reduction to intangible assets increase to stockholders equity reduction to income tax provision total realization of any additional deferred tax assets in any of our markets depends on future profitability in these markets 
our ability to generate the expected amounts of taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions  technology trends  political uncertainties  competitive pressures and other factors beyond management s control 
if our operations demonstrate profitability  we may reverse additional deferred tax asset valuation allowances in the future 
we will continue to evaluate the deferred tax asset valuation allowance balances in all of our foreign operating companies and in our us companies throughout to determine the appropriate level of valuation reserves 
mexico syndicated loan 
in october  we closed on a million  five year syndicated loan facility in mexico 
the facility can be drawn down  under certain conditions  within days from the date of closing 
of the total amount of the facility  million will be denominated in us dollars  with a floating interest rate based on libor  million will be denominated in mexican pesos  with a floating interest rate based on the mexican reference rate tiie  and million will be denominated in mexican pesos  at an interest rate fixed at the time of funding 
we intend to hedge the currency and interest rate risks so that the facility is an effective fixed rate mexican peso credit facility 
as of december   we have not drawn on this loan 
mexico derivative transaction 
in november  our mexican operating company  which we refer to as nextel mexico  entered into a hedge agreement to reduce its foreign currency transaction risk associated with a portion of its us dollar forecasted capital expenditures and handset purchases 
under the november agreement  nextel mexico purchased a us dollar call option for million and sold a call option on the mexican peso for million for a net cost of million 
the hedge agreement covers million of purchases in the calendar year 
change in accounting principle 
until september   we presented the financial information of our consolidated foreign operating companies in our consolidated financial statements utilizing accounts as of a date one month earlier than the accounts of the parent company  us subsidiaries and our non operating non us subsidiaries  which we refer to as our one month lag reporting policy 
as a result  each year the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of each of our wholly owned foreign operating companies in mexico  brazil  argentina  peru and chile were presented as of and for the year ended november in contrast  financial information relating to our us subsidiaries and our non operating non us subsidiaries was presented as of and for the year ended december over the past several years  we have redesigned processes to increase the timeliness of internal reporting 
we have established common and updated financial information systems 
as a result of these improvements  we eliminated the one month reporting lag on october   effective january   and report consolidated results using a consistent calendar year reporting period for the entire company see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
we accounted for the elimination of the one month lag reporting policy as a change in accounting principle in accordance with accounting principle board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting changes  effective january  under apb opinion no 
 a change in accounting principle is determined in the beginning of period of change 
as a result  we treated the month of december  which was normally the first month in the fiscal year of our foreign operating companies  as the lag month  and our fiscal year for all of our foreign operating companies now begins with january and ends with december amended filings 
on march   we filed an amended and restated annual report on form k a for the fiscal year 
we also filed amended and restated quarterly reports on form q a as of and for each of the periods ended march   june  and september  we restated our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   the two months ended december   the ten months ended october  and the first three quarters of and to correct for bookkeeping errors at our operating company in mexico  accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowance reversals and various other items see note to our consolidated financial statements 
subsequent events spectrum auction 
on january   the mexican government began an auction for spectrum in the mhz to mhz frequency band 
inversiones nextel de mexico  a subsidiary of nextel mexico  participated in this auction 
the spectrum auction was divided into three separate auctions auction for northern mexico zone  auction for northern mexico zone and auction for central and southern mexico 
the auctions were completed between february and february nextel mexico won an average of mhz of nationwide spectrum  except for mexico city  where no spectrum was auctioned off and where nextel mexico has licenses covering approximately mhz 
the corresponding licenses and immediate use of the spectrum were granted to inversiones nextel de mexico on march  these new licenses have an initial term of years  the expected amortization period of the licenses  and are renewable thereafter for years 
nextel mexico paid an up front fee of million for these licenses  excluding certain annual fees 
brazilian contingencies nextel brazil has received various assessment notices from state and federal brazilian authorities asserting deficiencies in payments related primarily to value added taxes and import duties based on the classification of equipment and services 
nextel brazil has filed various administrative and legal petitions disputing these assessments 
in some cases nextel brazil has received favorable decisions  which are currently being appealed by the respective governmental authority 
in other cases nextel brazil s petitions have been denied and nextel brazil is currently appealing those decisions 
nextel brazil is also disputing various other claims 
as a result of ongoing analysis  further consultations with external legal counsel  settlement of certain matters  and the expiration of the statue of limitations for certain contingencies during  nextel brazil reduced its liabilities by million 
of this total  we recorded million as a reduction to operating expenses  reclassified million of a settled claim to current liabilities for payment and recorded the remainder to other income 
during  we reversed million in liabilities 
of this total  we recorded million as a reduction to operating expenses and the remainder to other income 
as of december  and  nextel brazil had accrued liabilities of million and million  respectively  related to contingencies of which million and million were classified as other long term liabilities and million and million were classified as accrued expenses 
we currently estimate the range of possible losses related to matters for which we have not accrued liabilities to be between million and million as of december  we are continuing to evaluate the likelihood of probable and possible losses  if any  related to all known contingencies 
as a result  future increases or decreases to our accrued contingencies may be necessary 
mexican tax contingencies on december   the mexican congress created a new tax on the revenues of telecommunications companies  which nextel mexico legally disputed 
in november  the mexican tax authority confirmed that nextel mexico s interconnection services were exempt from payment under the telecommunications tax law 
the tax authority also stated that  in its opinion  dispatch  paging and value added services were taxable services and had no applicable exceptions 
nextel mexico continued to accrue and pay taxes related to these services 
nextel mexico also initiated legal proceedings with respect to the payments made under the telecommunications tax law 
the legal proceedings are ongoing 
on december   the mexican congress amended the tax on the revenues of telecommunications companies and enacted the telecommunications tax law 
with respect to our interconnection services  based on guidance provided by our legal advisors  we believe such services were exempt from the law 
consequently  nextel mexico did not accrue taxes specifically related to revenue derived from such services 
however  with respect to our dispatch  paging and value added services  nextel mexico initiated a legal proceeding to dispute the telecommunications tax law 
as of january   the mexican congress repealed the telecommunications tax on a prospective basis 
in the fourth quarter of  we terminated the legal proceedings and paid million for the taxes accrued as liabilities during as of december  and  nextel mexico had accrued liabilities of million and million related to various other contingencies 
argentine contingencies during  nextel argentina recorded a million liability for an increase in local turnover taxes 
specifically  in one of the markets in which we operate  the city government had previously increased the turnover tax rate from to of revenues for cellular companies 
from a regulatory standpoint  we are not considered a cellular company 
as a result  we continue to pay the turnover tax at the existing rate and record a liability for the differential between the old rate and the new rate 
similarly  one of the provincial governments in one of the markets where we operate had also increased their turnover tax rate from to of revenues for cellular companies 
consistent with our earlier position  we continue to pay the turnover tax at the existing rate and accrue a liability for the increase in the rate 
during  we also recorded a million liability for various municipality charges levied on nextel argentina typically related to the use or construction of our sites or towers 
as of december  and  nextel argentina had recorded million and million  respectively  as liabilities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates  actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates 
the sec has defined a company s critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
we also have other accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results 
for additional information see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included at the end of this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition 
while our revenue recognition policy does not require the exercise of significant judgment or the use of significant estimates  we believe that our policy is significant as revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
operating revenues primarily consist of service revenues and revenues generated from the sale of digital handsets and accessories 
service revenues primarily include fixed monthly access charges for digital mobile telephone service and digital two way radio and other services including revenues from calling party pays programs and variable charges for airtime and digital two way radio usage in excess of plan minutes  long distance charges and international roaming revenues derived from calls placed by our customers 
we also have other less significant sources of revenues 
other revenues primarily include revenues generated from our handset maintenance programs  roaming revenues generated from other companies customers that roam on our networks and co location rental revenues from third party tenants that rent space on our towers 
we recognize revenue for access charges and other services charged at fixed amounts ratably over the service period  net of credits and adjustments for service discounts 
we recognize excess usage  local  long distance and calling party pays revenue at contractual rates per minute as minutes are used 
we record cash received in excess of revenues earned as deferred revenues 
we bill excess usage to our customers in arrears 
in order to recognize the revenues originated from excess usage subsequent to customer invoicing through the end of the reporting period  we estimate the unbilled portion based on the usage that the handset had during the part of the month already billed  and we use this actual usage to estimate the unbilled usage for the rest of the month taking into consideration working days and seasonality 
our estimates are based on our experience in each market 
we periodically evaluate our estimation process by comparing our estimates to actual excess usage revenue billed the following month 
as a result  actual usage could differ from our estimates 
from january  through october   we recognized revenue from handset sales on a straight line basis over the expected customer relationship periods of up to four years  starting when the customer took title 
effective november   in connection with our adoption of fresh start accounting in accordance with sop  we revised our revenue recognition policy in connection with our adoption of emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
we believe that we meet the criteria contained in eitf no 
for separately accounting for sales of our handsets  namely  our handsets have value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the wireless service that we provide  and delivery of wireless service is probable and substantially in our control 
as a result  we now recognize all revenue from sales and related cost of sales of handsets when title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
this change did not impact our operating income for the two months ended december  or for the years ended december  and and will not change operating income in future periods 
we recognize revenue from accessory sales when title and risk of loss passes upon delivery of the accessory to the customer 
we recognize revenue generated from our handset maintenance programs on a monthly basis at fixed amounts over the service period 
we recognize roaming revenues at contractual rates per minute as minutes are used 
we recognize co location revenues from third party tenants on a monthly basis based on the terms set by the underlying agreements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable sufficient to cover probable and reasonably estimated losses 
our methodology for determining our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable requires significant estimates 
since we have several hundred thousand accounts  it is impractible to review the collectibility of all individual accounts when we determine the amount of our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable each period 
therefore  we consider a number of factors in establishing the allowance  including historical collection experience  current economic trends  estimates of forecasted write offs  agings of the accounts receivable portfolio and other factors 
while we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable  actual results could differ from those estimates 
valuation of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment and identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
a review of our long lived assets requires us to make estimates of our undiscounted cash flows over several years into the future in order to determine whether our long lived assets were impaired 
if the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we are required to make estimates of the fair value of our long lived assets in order to calculate the loss  if any  equal to the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the assets 
we make significant assumptions and estimates in this process regarding matters that are inherently uncertain  such as future cash flows  remaining useful lives  discount rates and growth rates 
the resulting cash flows are computed over an extended period of time  which subjects those assumptions and estimates to an even larger degree of uncertainty 
when known and available  we also use comparable values of similar businesses in lieu of or to corroborate the results from the discounted cash flows approach  although this is generally not entirely comparable since our network technology is proprietary  not widely adopted and relies on the efforts of primarily one vendor for infrastructure  handsets  development and maintenance activities 
in conducting these valuations  we generally engage an independent third party valuation expert to review and validate our methodology and conclusions 
while we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable  different assumptions regarding these future cash flows  discount rates and growth rates could materially affect our valuations 
lastly  we record any reversals of deferred tax asset valuation allowances that were in existence at the time of our emergence from chapter reorganization first as a reduction to our intangibles assets existing at our emergence from reorganization until fully exhausted and then as an increase to paid in capital 
depreciation of property  plant and equipment 
our business is capital intensive because of our digital mobile networks 
we record at cost our digital network assets and other improvements that in management s opinion  extend the useful lives of the underlying assets  and depreciate the assets over their estimated useful lives 
we calculate depreciation using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives of to years for digital mobile network equipment and software and to years for office equipment  furniture and fixtures  and other 
we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the lease terms or the useful lives of the improvements 
our digital mobile networks are highly complex and  due to constant innovation and enhancements  certain components of the networks may lose their utility faster than anticipated 
we periodically reassess the economic life of these components and make adjustments to their expected lives after considering historical experience and capacity requirements  consulting with the vendor and assessing new product and market demands and other factors 
when these factors indicate network components may not be useful for as long as originally anticipated  we depreciate the remaining book value over the remaining useful lives 
further  the timing and deployment of any new technologies could affect the estimated remaining useful lives of our digital network assets  which could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the future 
amortization of intangible assets 
we record our licenses at historical cost and amortize them using the straight line method based on an estimated useful life of years 
the terms of our licenses  including renewals  range from to years 
however  the wireless telecommunications industry is experiencing significant technological change 
future technological advancements may render iden technology obsolete 
additionally  the political and regulatory environments in the markets we serve are continuously changing and  in many cases  the renewal fees could be significant 
therefore  we do not view the renewal of our licenses to be perfunctory 
as a result  we classify our licenses as finite lived assets 
our licenses and the requirements to maintain the licenses are subject to renewal after the initial term  provided that we have complied with applicable rules and policies in each of our markets 
we intend to comply  and believe we have complied  with these rules and policies in all material respects 
however  because governmental authorities have discretion as to the grant or renewal of licenses  our licenses may not be renewed  which could have a significant impact on our estimated useful lives 
this would affect our results of operations in the future 
foreign currency 
results of operations for our non us subsidiaries and affiliates are translated from the designated functional currency to the us dollar using average exchange rates during the period  while assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the reporting date 
resulting gains or losses from translating foreign currency financial statements are reported as other comprehensive loss income 
because average exchange rates are used to translate the operations of our non us subsidiaries  our operating companies trends may be impacted by the translation 
for example  in country us dollar based trends may be accentuated or attenuated by changes in translation rates 
the effects of changes in exchange rates associated with us dollar denominated intercompany loans to our foreign subsidiaries that are of a long term investment nature are reported as part of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment in our consolidated financial statements 
we view the intercompany loans from our us subsidiaries to nextel brazil and nextel chile as of a long term investment nature 
in contrast  the effects of exchange rates associated with us dollar denominated intercompany loans to our foreign subsidiaries that are due  or for which repayment is anticipated  in the foreseeable future  are reported as foreign currency transaction losses gains  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
as a result  our determination of whether intercompany loans are of a long term investment nature can have a significant impact on the calculation of foreign currency transaction losses gains and the foreign currency translation adjustment 
loss contingencies 
we account for and disclose loss contingencies such as pending litigation and actual or possible claims and assessments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires us to make judgments regarding future events  including an assessment relating to the likelihood that a loss has occurred and an estimate of the amount of such loss 
in assessing loss contingencies  we often seek the assistance of legal counsel 
as a result of the significant judgment required in assessing and estimating loss contingencies  actual losses realized in future periods could differ significantly from our estimates 
reporting under chapter our consolidated financial statements for the two months ended december  and ten months ended october  included at the end of this annual report on k reflect accounting and reporting policies required by sop these policies include the following while we were in chapter reorganization  we segregated and classified as liabilities subject to compromise in our balance sheet those liabilities and obligations whose treatment and satisfaction were dependent on the outcome of our reorganization 
if as of the date of our balance sheet there was uncertainty about whether a secured claim was under secured or impaired under our plan of reorganization  we included the entire amount of the claim in liabilities subject to compromise 
only those liabilities that were obligations of or guaranteed by nii holdings or nii holdings delaware  inc were included in liabilities subject to compromise 
amounts reported in liabilities subject to compromise during the year may vary significantly from the stated amounts of proofs of claim filed with the bankruptcy court 
we classified in reorganization items in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations all items of income  expense  gain or loss that were realized or incurred because we were in reorganization 
we expensed as incurred professional fees associated with and incurred during our reorganization and reported them as reorganization items 
we classified in reorganization items interest income earned by nii holdings or nii holdings delaware  inc that would not have been earned but for our chapter filing 
we reported interest expense incurred subsequent to our bankruptcy filing only to the extent that it would be paid during the reorganization or that it was probable as of the date of such balance sheet that it would be an allowed claim 
principal and interest payments could not be made on pre petition debt subject to compromise without approval from the bankruptcy court or until a plan of reorganization defining the repayment terms was confirmed 
further  the bankruptcy code generally disallowed the payment of post petition interest that accrued with respect to unsecured or under secured claims 
as a result  we did not accrue interest that as of the date of such balance sheet we did not believe would be probable of being treated as an allowed claim 
we continued to accrue interest expense related to our credit facilities with motorola credit corporation  as our plan of reorganization that was confirmed by the bankruptcy court on october  contemplated the reinstatement in full of these facilities 
consistent with sop  we applied fresh start accounting as of october  and adopted accounting principles that were required to be adopted in our financial statements within twelve months of that date 
in addition  on october   we adjusted the carrying values of our assets and liabilities to their estimated fair values in accordance with sop stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement principles of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

as permitted by sfas no 
 we have chosen to continue to apply apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
and related interpretations in accounting for our employee related stock plans 
accordingly  in each period  we used the intrinsic value method to record stock based employee compensation 
no compensation expense has been recognized for stock options granted to employees with an exercise price equal to or above the trading price per share of our common stock on the grant date 
we account for stock based compensation to non employees at fair value using a black scholes option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of sfas  no 
and other applicable accounting principles 
since compensation expense is measured based on the estimated fair value of options rather than the intrinsic value  if we had applied sfas no 
to all stock based compensation  our results of operations would have been different 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further information surrounding the effect of applying sfas no 
on our results of operations 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as such  we use the asset and liability method under which we recognize deferred income taxes for the tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities including operating losses and tax loss carryforwards 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recoverable or settled 
we recognize the effect on deferred taxes for a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we provide a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if  based upon the weight of available evidence  we believe it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets at each reporting period 
our assessments generally consider several factors  including the reversal of existing deferred tax asset temporary differences  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and historical and future book income adjusted for permanent book to tax differences 
during the fourth quarter of  we expanded the analysis of future projections that we performed in our assessment due to an additional year of profitability in realization of any additional deferred tax assets in any of our markets depends on continued future profitability in these markets 
our ability to generate the expected amounts of taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions  technology trends  political uncertainties  competitive pressures and other factors beyond management s control 
if our operations continue to demonstrate profitability  we may further reverse additional deferred tax asset valuation allowance balances during we will continue to evaluate the deferred tax asset valuation allowance balances in all of our foreign operating companies and in our us companies throughout to determine the appropriate level of valuation reserves

results of operation operating revenues primarily consist of wireless service revenues and revenues generated from the sale of digital handsets and accessories 
service revenues primarily include fixed monthly access charges for digital mobile telephone service and digital two way radio and other services  revenues from calling party pays programs and variable charges for airtime and digital two way radio usage in excess of plan minutes and local and long distance charges derived from calls placed by our customers 
see revenue recognition above and note to our audited consolidated financial statements included at the end of this annual report on form k for a description of a recent change in our revenue recognition method related to digital handsets 
cost of revenues primarily includes the cost of providing wireless service and the cost of digital handset and accessory sales 
cost of providing service consists largely of costs of interconnection with local exchange carrier facilities and direct switch and transmitter and receiver site costs  including property taxes  insurance costs  utility costs  maintenance costs and rent for the network switches and sites used to operate our digital mobile networks 
interconnection costs have fixed and variable components 
the fixed component of interconnection costs consists of monthly flat rate fees for facilities leased from local exchange carriers 
the variable component of interconnection costs  which fluctuates in relation to the volume and duration of wireless calls  generally consists of per minute use fees charged by wireline and wireless providers for wireless calls from our digital handsets terminating on their networks 
cost of digital handset and accessory sales consists largely of the cost of the handset and accessories  order fulfillment and installation related expenses  as well as write downs of digital handset and related accessory inventory for shrinkage or obsolescence 
our service and other revenues and the variable component of our cost of service are primarily driven by the number of digital handsets in service and not necessarily by the number of customers  as one customer may purchase one or many digital handsets 
our digital handset and accessory revenues and cost of digital handset and accessory sales are primarily driven by the number of new handsets placed into service and handset upgrades provided during the year

nextel mexico s profitability is a result of subscriber growth with increasing average revenues per subscriber and operating costs maintained in line with revenues 
additional subscriber growth was the result of selectively expanding coverage in new markets and improving network quality and capacity  including launching service in baja california and providing voice and data coverage to a busy cross border area between tijuana and san diego 
coverage expansion and network improvements were attributable to capital expenditures totaling million for the year ended december  and a share of all capital expenditure investments that we made during  a trend that we expect will likely continue in the near future 
average revenues per subscriber improved due to the implementation of new rate plans and increased minutes of use in interconnect and dispatch traffic 
nextel mexico also decreased its customer turnover by making concentrated investments in customer retention programs 
we expect growth to continue as we build out new markets over the next two to three years using spectrum that we acquired in march in the mhz auctions

these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million  or  in bad debt expense  which also decreased as a percentage of revenues from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  primarily due to improved collections and stricter credit screening procedures 
interest expense the million  or  decrease in interest expense from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily due to a decrease in interest related to nextel mexico s portion of the international equipment facility in connection with the extinguishment of this facility in this decrease was partially offset by an increase in interest incurred on nextel mexico s tower financing obligations due to a full year of interest incurred on tower sale leaseback transactions that occurred throughout foreign currency transaction gains losses  net net foreign currency transaction gains of million for the year ended december  are primarily due to the relative strengthening of the mexican peso during the fourth quarter of compared to the us dollar on nextel mexico s us dollar based liabilities during that period

cost of revenues the million  or  increase in cost of service from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is largely a result of the following a million  or  increase in interconnect costs primarily caused by a increase in total system minutes of use  as well as significant increases in interconnect costs per minute of use resulting from the implementation of a termination fees between mobile carriers during the second quarter of  a million  or  increase in service and repair costs due to an increase in activity associated with nextel argentina s handset maintenance program  and a million  or  increase in direct switch and transmitter and receiver site costs due to a increase in the number of cell sites on air from december  to december  and the accrual of site tax contingencies levied by the municipalities 
the million  or  increase in cost of digital handset and accessory sales from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily due to the increase in handset sales as well as the million increase in handset upgrade subsidies from to as a result of an increase in upgrade activities 
selling and marketing expenses the million  or  increase in nextel argentina s selling and marketing expenses from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily a result of the following a million  or  increase in indirect commissions resulting from a increase in handset sales by indirect dealers  a million  or  increase in advertising expenses primarily resulting from new advertising and branding promotions  and a million  or  increase in payroll  payroll related costs and direct commissions primarily as the result of an increase in sales and marketing personnel and a increase in handset sales by nextel argentina s sales force

credit and collections headcount also increased during which contributed to the overall increase 
these expenses were somewhat offset by a million  or  decrease in bad debt expense  which also decreased as a percentage of revenues from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  bad debt decreased mainly due to improved collection procedures in compared with depreciation and amortization the million  or  increase in depreciation and amortization from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily due to a increase in nextel argentina s gross property  plant and equipment as a result of expansion to new areas and existing markets 
interest expense the million increase in interest expense is due to the recognition of interest incurred on gross revenue tax contingencies recorded in other income  net in connection with our emergence from chapter reorganization in  one of our corporate entities repurchased nextel argentina s credit facilities from its creditors 
while this corporate entity contributed the principal balance to nextel argentina as a capital investment  it forgave the accrued interest related to these credit facilities during the first quarter of other income  net  of million for the year ended december  consists primarily of the gain related to the forgiveness of this accrued interest 
we eliminated this intercompany loan for consolidation purposes so it did not impact our consolidated results

this increase was largely the result of a increase in average consolidated digital handsets in service  as well as an increase in average consolidated revenues per handset resulting from the introduction of higher priced service plans and increased usage 
we achieved the increase in average consolidated revenues per handset for the year ended december  despite an depreciation in the average value of the mexican peso and a depreciation in the average value of the brazilian real compared to the us dollar from to the increase in consolidated operating revenues was also the result of a million  or  increase in consolidated digital handset and accessory revenues from the year ended december  to the year ended december   primarily caused by a change in accounting for digital handset sales that we implemented in the fourth quarter of  under which we now recognize all revenues and cost of revenues from sales of handsets when title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
the increase in consolidated digital handset and accessory revenues also resulted from a increase in handset sales and a change in the mix of handsets sold in toward higher priced models compared to cost of revenues the million  or  increase in consolidated cost of revenues from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is due to a million  or  increase in consolidated cost of service and a million  or  increase in consolidated cost of digital handset and accessory sales 
the increase in consolidated cost of service resulted in part from a million increase in consolidated service and repair costs  largely caused by costs incurred for claims submitted in connection with a new handset insurance program in mexico during and the implementation of a new program in argentina under which new handsets are provided to customers to replace damaged handsets 
the increase in consolidated cost of service was also due to a million  or  increase in interconnect costs  primarily driven by a increase in consolidated minutes of use  and an million  or  increase in site and switch costs largely caused by a increase in the number of cell sites on air 
these increases were partially offset by the depreciation of the mexican peso and the brazilian real compared to the us dollar

we did not incur any impairment  restructuring or other charges during depreciation and amortization the million  or  increase in consolidated depreciation and amortization from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily the result of an increase in amortization resulting from the recognition of customer base assets  primarily in mexico  which have relatively shorter useful lives compared to our other intangible assets  in connection with our application of fresh start accounting rules on october  this increase in amortization was partially offset by a decrease in amortization related to the reversal of certain valuation allowances for deferred tax assets created in connection with our application of fresh start accounting  which we recorded as a reduction to the intangible assets that existed as of the date of our application of fresh start accounting

nextel mexico s profitability is a result of subscriber growth with increasing average revenues per subscriber and operating costs maintained in line with revenues 
additional subscriber growth was the result of selectively expanding coverage in new markets and improving network quality and capacity  including launching service in baja california and providing voice and data coverage to a busy cross border area between tijuana and san diego 
coverage expansion and network improvements were attributable to capital expenditures totaling million for the year ended december   a increase from  and a share of all capital expenditure investments that we made during  a trend that we expect will likely continue in the near future 
average revenues per subscriber improved due to the implementation of new rate plans and increased minutes of use in interconnect and dispatch traffic 
nextel mexico also decreased its customer turnover by making concentrated investments in customer retention programs 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  we translated nextel mexico s results of operations using the average exchange rates for the year ended december  the average exchange rate of the mexican peso for the year ended december  depreciated against the us dollar by from the year ended december  as a result  as compared to  the components of nextel mexico s results of operations for after translation into us dollars reflect lower increases than would have occurred if it were not for the impact of the depreciation of the peso  taking into consideration our one month lag financial reporting policy for our non us operating subsidiaries 
operating revenues the million  or  increase in service and other revenues from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily a result of the following a increase in the average number of digital handsets in service resulting from growth in mexico s existing markets  the expansion of service coverage in mexico and continued emphasis on maintaining brand awareness  an increase in average revenue per handset primarily due to the successful implementation of previously introduced monthly service plans and increased usage  and revenue generated from the implementation of an amended handset insurance program during these increases were partially offset by the depreciation of the mexican peso 
the million  or  increase in digital handset and accessory revenues from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is largely the result of a change in accounting for digital handset revenues that nextel mexico implemented during the fourth quarter of  when it began recognizing all digital handset revenue and cost of revenue upon delivery of the handset to the customer 
this increase is also due to a increase in handset sales and a change in the mix of handsets sold during  which included a higher proportion of expensive models than those sold during cost of revenues the million  or  increase in cost of service from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is principally a result of the following increases in variable costs related to interconnect fees resulting from a increase in total system minutes of use  partially offset by decreases in variable rates per minute of use beginning in when nextel mexico renegotiated interconnect rates with some of its traffic carriers  increases in service and repair expenses  primarily due to an amended handset insurance program that resulted in the reclassification of handset insurance program revenues that were netted against costs and an increase in claims under the handset insurance program as a result of growth in nextel mexico s customer base  and increases in fixed costs related to direct switch and transmitter and receiver site costs  including utility and warranty costs that nextel mexico incurred resulting from a increase in the number of transmitter and receiver sites in service from december  to december  these increases were partially offset by the depreciation of the mexican peso 
as is the case with our other operating companies  nextel mexico subsidizes handset sales to attract new customers and offers handset upgrades and other retention inducements to retain existing customers 
the million  or  increase in nextel mexico s cost of digital handset and accessory sales from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily due to the change in accounting for digital handset sales described above  an increase in handset upgrades provided to current customers and a increase in handset sales 
selling and marketing expenses the million  or  increase in nextel mexico s selling and marketing expenses from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily the result of a million increase in direct commission and payroll expenses  primarily due to an increase in local currency payroll costs as a result of an increase in sales and marketing personnel  and an increase in commissions incurred as a result of a increase in handset sales  partially offset by the depreciation of the mexican peso 
general and administrative expenses the million  or  increase in nextel mexico s general and administrative expenses from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily a result of the following a million  or  increase in general corporate expenses primarily caused by an increase in operating taxes on certain gross revenues  an increase in payroll and related expenses and higher rent and building maintenance costs  and a million  or  increase in customer care and billing operations primarily due to an increase in payroll and related expenses caused by an increase in customer care personnel to support a larger customer base and the implementation of new customer retention programs 
bad debt expense remained relatively flat from to these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million  or  in information technology expenses primarily due to lower information technology software maintenance expenses and the depreciation of the mexican peso 
depreciation and amortization the million  or  increase in depreciation and amortization from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is largely due to increase amortization expenses related to million in intangible assets  in particular customer base and tradename  that nextel mexico recognized as a result of the application of fresh start accounting rules in the fourth quarter of the recognition of the customer base and its short useful life relative to other intangible assets substantially increased amortization for compared to this increase in amortization was partially offset by a decrease in amortization related to the reversal of certain valuation allowances for deferred tax assets created in connection with our application of fresh start accounting  which we recorded as a reduction to the intangible assets that existed as of the date of our application of fresh start accounting 
the overall increase in amortization was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation as a result of million in fixed asset write downs that nextel mexico recognized in applying fresh start accounting rules 
these charges substantially reduced the cost bases of nextel mexico s fixed assets  resulting in lower depreciation charges during compared to additionally  the decrease in depreciation was partially offset by depreciation initiated on million of capital expenditures that nextel mexico made during interest expense  net the million increase in interest expense  net  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily due to the following interest incurred on nextel mexico s million tower financing obligations  which nextel mexico incurred in connection with the sale leaseback of communication towers during  interest incurred on nextel mexico s million portion of the international equipment facility for which it became obligated in november  and the recognition of nextel mexico s million portion of the loss on the termination of the interest rate swap associated with the international equipment facility in the third quarter of these increases were partially offset by decreases in interest related to nextel mexico s handset financing balances and an increase in interest income due to higher average cash balances  largely due to cash proceeds received in connection with nextel mexico s tower sale leaseback transactions 
foreign currency transaction losses gains  net net foreign currency transaction losses of million and million for the years ended december  and are primarily due to the impact from the weakening of the mexican peso on nextel mexico s us dollar denominated net liabilities

nextel brazil successor predecessor successor of company company of company nextel two months ten months combined nextel change from year ended brazil s ended ended year ended brazil s previous year december  operating december  october  december  operating revenues revenues dollars percent dollars in thousands operating revenues service and other revenues digital handset and accessory revenues cost of revenues cost of service exclusive of depreciation included below cost of digital handset and accessory sales selling and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses segment earnings restructuring and other charges depreciation and amortization operating income interest expense  net foreign currency transaction gains losses  net gain on extinguishment of debt reorganization items  net other expense  net income loss before income tax due to our cash conservation initiatives  from the fourth quarter of continuing through the first quarter of  we significantly reduced the funding to nextel brazil 
because of the reduction in funding  nextel brazil was not able to complete the construction of its digital mobile network consistent with the quality standards in our other operations or to invest significant amounts on customer acquisition and retention efforts 
as a result  nextel brazil experienced high customer turnover  leading to a decreasing customer base and a decline in revenues 
during the second quarter of  we completed a review of nextel brazil s sales and customer retention strategy  including branding  pricing  promotion and distribution 
in addition  we evaluated nextel brazil s network quality and coverage to ensure our wireless coverage matches our targeted customers expectations 
as a result of these assessments  we are revitalizing our sales programs by simplifying and launching new rate plans  implementing customer retention programs  enhancing brand awareness and are making modest incremental investments to the digital mobile network in key metropolitan areas of brazil 
while nextel brazil has made some progress in adding new customers  reducing customer turnover and improving network quality  we cannot be sure that these efforts will have a significant positive long term impact on nextel brazil s results of operations in the future 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  we translated nextel brazil s results of operations using the average exchange rates for the year ended december  the average exchange rate for the year ended december  depreciated against the us dollar by from the year ended december  as a result  the components of nextel brazil s results of operations for the year ended december  after translation into us dollars reflect decreases compared to its results of operations for the combined year ended december   taking into consideration our one month lag financial reporting policy for our non us operating subsidiaries 
operating revenues the million  or  decrease in service and other revenues from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily a result of the depreciation of the brazilian real compared to the us dollar and an decrease in the average number of digital handsets in service 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in average revenue per handset on a local currency basis  largely due to an increase in revenue from calling party pays service agreements that nextel brazil implemented with various fixed line and wireless operators  as well as the implementation of new monthly service plans 
the million  or  decrease in digital handset and accessory sales from the year ended december  to the year ended december  primarily resulted from the implementation of a handset rental program in brazil during  under which customers can rent rather than buy handsets for use on nextel brazil s network  as well as the impact resulting from a change in accounting for digital handset revenues that nextel brazil implemented during the fourth quarter of this decrease was partially offset by an increase in handset sales from to cost of revenues the million  or  decrease in cost of service from the year ended december  to the year ended december  primarily resulted from the depreciation of the brazilian real compared to the us dollar and a decrease in local currency interconnect costs due to a decrease in minutes of use resulting from lower average digital handsets in service 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in direct switch and transmitter and receiver site costs that nextel brazil incurred as a result of a increase in the number of transmitter and receiver sites in service from december  to december  as is the case with our other operating companies  nextel brazil subsidizes handset sales to attract new customers and offers handset upgrades and other retention inducements to retain existing customers 
the million  or  increase in cost of digital handset and accessory sales from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is largely due to an increase in handset sales and rentals 
selling and marketing expenses the million  or  decrease in nextel brazil s selling and marketing expenses from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily a result of the depreciation of the brazilian real and a decrease in marketing expenses  partially offset by an increase in commissions resulting from an increase in handset sales 
general and administrative expenses the million  or  decrease in nextel brazil s general and administrative expenses is primarily a result of the following a million  or  decrease in general corporate expenses largely resulting from a million  or  reduction in tax and other contingency expenses and the depreciation of the brazilian real  and a million  or  decrease in bad debt expense  which also decreased as a percentage of revenues from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   primarily as a result of improved collections during  a change in nextel brazil s bad debt reserve policy and the depreciation of the brazilian real 
depreciation and amortization the million  or  decrease in depreciation and amortization from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is partially the result of million in long lived asset write downs that nextel brazil recognized as a result of the application of fresh start accounting rules on october  these write downs substantially reduced the cost bases of nextel brazil s long lived assets and resulted in less depreciation during than during in addition  the decrease in amortization reflects the reversal of certain valuation allowances for deferred tax assets created in connection with our application of fresh start accounting  which we recorded as a reduction to the intangible assets that existed as of the date of our application of fresh start accounting 
interest expense  net the million  or  decrease in net interest expense from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily due to a reduction of interest related to handset financing as a result of the pay down of nextel brazil s handset financing liabilities during and the extinguishment of nextel brazil s equipment financing facility in september these decreases were partially offset by interest incurred on nextel brazil s million tower financing obligations  which nextel brazil recognized in connection with the sale leaseback of communication towers during foreign currency transaction gains losses  net net foreign currency transaction gains of million for the year ended december  are largely due to the relative strengthening of the brazilian real compared to the us dollar on nextel brazil s us dollar based liabilities during that period  primarily its equipment financing facility 
net foreign currency transaction losses of million for the year ended december  are primarily due to the relative weakening of the brazilian real compared to the us dollar on nextel brazil s us dollar based liabilities during that period 
nextel brazil s exposure to foreign currency transaction losses was reduced significantly in september as a result of the extinguishment of its equipment financing facility 
gain on extinguishment of debt in july  we entered into an agreement with motorola credit corporation to retire our indebtedness under nextel brazil s equipment financing facility 
in connection with this agreement  in september we paid million to motorola credit corporation in consideration of the million in outstanding principal and million in accrued and unpaid interest under nextel brazil s equipment financing facility 
as a result  nextel brazil recognized a million gain on the retirement of this facility during the year ended december  reorganization items  net as a result of applying fresh start accounting rules during the fourth quarter of  nextel brazil adjusted the carrying values of its long lived assets to their estimated fair values and recognized a million charge in reorganization items 
reorganization items  net  for the year ended december  also include employee retention costs associated with our chapter reorganization

nextel argentina successor predecessor successor of company company of company nextel two months ten months combined nextel change from year ended argentina s ended ended year ended argentina s previous year december  operating december  october  december  operating revenues revenues dollars percent dollars in thousands operating revenues service and other revenues digital handset and accessory revenues cost of revenues cost of service exclusive of depreciation included below cost of digital handset and accessory sales selling and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses segment earnings impairment  restructuring and other charges depreciation and amortization operating income interest income expense  net foreign currency transaction gains losses  net reorganization items  net other income expense  net income loss before income tax in  nextel argentina s operations were negatively impacted by the adverse economic and political conditions existing in argentina 
at the beginning of  nextel argentina implemented a contingency plan  which included workforce reductions  the introduction of new handset leasing programs and pricing plans designed to retain customers 
as a result of the financial difficulties facing its customers and its policies related to suspension and deactivation of nonpaying customers  nextel argentina experienced increased customer turnover rates and higher bad debt expense during the first half of despite these challenging conditions  during the second half of  nextel argentina grew its business by adding subscribers  lowered its customer turnover and reduced its bad debt expense 
since the beginning of  the macroeconomic environment has begun to show signs of improvement as evidenced by the appreciation of the argentine peso relative to the us dollar 
consistent with this improved economic environment  nextel argentina has continued growing its subscriber base  significantly lowering its customer turnover and reducing its bad debt expense  while substantially increasing its operating revenues 
as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the economic conditions in argentina  we cannot predict whether this trend will continue 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we translated nextel argentina s results of operations using the average exchange rates for the years ended december  and the average exchange rate of the argentine peso for the year ended december  depreciated against the us dollar by from the year ended december  as a result  the components of nextel argentina s results of operations for after translation into us dollars are generally comparable to its results of operations for  taking into consideration our one month lag financial reporting policy for our non us operating subsidiaries 
operating revenues the million  or  increase in service and other revenues from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily a result of the following a increase in the average number of digital handsets in service  resulting from growth in nextel argentina s existing markets and lower customer turnover  and an increase in average revenue per handset  largely due to monthly service plans with higher access fees that nextel argentina introduced in and the implementation of a termination fee between mobile carriers during the second quarter of the million  or  increase in digital handset and accessory revenues from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily a result of the following a change in accounting for digital handset revenues that nextel argentina implemented during the fourth quarter of  when it began recognizing all digital handset revenue and related cost of revenue upon delivery of the handset to the customer  and an increase in handset sales and a change in the mix of handsets sold during  which included a higher proportion of expensive models than those sold during  when handset sales primarily included lower cost refurbished models 
cost of revenues the million  or  increase in cost of service from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is largely a result of the following an increase in variable costs related to interconnect fees resulting from a increase in total system minutes of use  primarily due to an increase in the number of digital handsets in service and the implementation of rate plans with increased volumes of usable minutes  a significant increase in per minute costs related to interconnect minutes of use resulting from the signing of interconnect agreements with other mobile service providers during the second quarter of  an increase in service and repair costs resulting from increased activity associated with a program under which nextel argentina provides new handsets to customers to replace damaged handsets  and an increase in fixed costs related to direct switch and transmitter and receiver site costs that nextel argentina incurred as a result of a increase in the number of transmitter and receiver sites in service from december  to december  as is the case with our other operating companies  nextel argentina subsidizes handset sales to attract new customers and offers handset upgrades and other retention inducements to retain existing customers 
the million  or  increase in cost of digital handset and accessory sales from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is mostly due to the increase in handset sales and an increase in handset upgrades  as well as a significant increase in the proportion of new to refurbished handsets sold 
selling and marketing expenses the million  or  increase in nextel argentina s selling and marketing expenses from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily a result of a million  or  increase in indirect commissions  mainly caused by a increase in handset sales obtained through indirect channels 
general and administrative expenses the million  or  increase in general and administrative expenses from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily a result of a million  or  increase in general corporate  customer care and billing operations expenses  mainly as a result of an increase in operating taxes on gross revenues in argentina 
the increase was partially offset by a million  or  decrease in bad debt expense  which also decreased as a percentage of revenues from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  bad debt decreased mainly due to stricter credit and collection policies  lower customer turnover and the resulting uncertainty surrounding adverse economic conditions in argentina during most of  which caused an increase in bad debt expense during that year 
impairment  restructuring and other charges during the year ended december   nextel argentina recorded a million impairment charge to write down the carrying values of its long lived assets as a result of the adverse economic conditions in argentina and incurred million in restructuring charges related to workforce reductions 
nextel argentina did not incur any impairment  restructuring or other charges during the year ended december  depreciation and amortization the million  or  increase in depreciation and amortization from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily due to a significant increase in nextel argentina s gross property  plant and equipment  partially offset by a decrease in amortization related to the reversal of certain valuation allowances for deferred tax assets created in connection with our application of fresh start accounting  which we recorded as a reduction to the intangible assets that existed as of the date of our application of fresh start accounting 
interest income expense  net interest expense  net  for the year ended december  primarily represents interest related to nextel argentina s credit facilities  which one of our corporate entities repurchased and retired during the fourth quarter of in connection with our emergence from chapter reorganization 
following this repurchase  nextel argentina is no longer incurring any interest expense related to these credit facilities and does not have any long term debt 
as a result  nextel argentina recorded net interest income for the year ended december  foreign currency transaction gains losses  net net foreign currency transaction losses of million for the year ended december  are primarily due to the impact of the depreciation of the argentine peso on nextel argentina s dollar denominated credit facilities 
nextel argentina s exposure to foreign currency transaction losses was reduced significantly during the fourth quarter of as a result of our repurchase of nextel argentina s credit facilities 
reorganization items  net reorganization items  net  of million for the year ended december  consists principally of a million write down of long lived assets in accordance with fresh start accounting principles and other retention costs that nextel argentina incurred in connection with our chapter reorganization 
other income expense  net in connection with our emergence from chapter reorganization in  one of our corporate entities repurchased nextel argentina s credit facilities from its creditors 
while this corporate entity contributed the principal balance to nextel argentina as a capital investment  it forgave the accrued interest related to these credit facilities during the first quarter of other income  net  of million for the year ended december  consists primarily of the gain related to the forgiveness of this accrued interest 
since this accrued interest was due between a corporate entity and a consolidated subsidiary  its forgiveness did not impact our consolidated results of operations

operating revenues increased from the year ended december  to the year ended december   but only increased from the year ended december  to the year ended december  in combination with the increase in operating revenues  an increase in interconnect fees resulting from an increase in rates led to stable segment earnings from to we expect nextel peru to grow its subscriber base and revenues as it broadens its target market to incorporate subscribers from micro enterprises in addition to its existing focus on small and medium sized corporate and business users 
because the us dollar is the functional currency in peru  nextel peru s results of operations are not significantly impacted by changes in the us dollar to peruvian sol exchange rate 
operating revenues the million  or  increase in service and other revenues from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily the result of a increase in the average number of digital handsets in service  partially offset by a decrease in average revenue per handset  largely due to the implementation of new rate plans with lower access revenues and higher interconnect rates during cost of revenues the million  or  increase in cost of service from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily a result of the following an increase in variable costs related to interconnect fees resulting from a increase in total system minutes of use  largely related to the increase in the average number of digital handsets in service  an increase in average variable cost per interconnect minute of use caused by higher interconnect rates that nextel peru began incurring in as a result of a change in intercarrier settlement methodologies due to a decision made by the peruvian telecommunications regulator  and an increase in fixed costs related to direct switch and transmitter and receiver site costs  including utility and warranty costs that nextel peru incurred as a result of a increase in the number of transmitter and receiver sites in service from december  to december  selling and marketing expenses the million  or  increase in nextel peru s selling and marketing expenses from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily a result of a million  or  increase in commissions and payroll expenses  partially offset by a million  or  decrease in advertising expenses  largely due to fewer advertising campaigns in general and administrative expenses the million  or  increase in nextel peru s general and administrative expenses from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily a result of the following a million  or  increase in customer care and billing operations expenses primarily as a result of an increase in payroll and related expenses related to an increase in customer care personnel necessary to support a larger customer base  and a million  or  increase in information technology expenses largely as a result of the implementation of a renumbering program which added an extra digit to all mobile numbers  new software licenses and maintenance and an increase in payroll and related expenses caused by an increase in information technology personnel 
depreciation and amortization the million  or  decrease in depreciation and amortization from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is partially the result of net long lived asset write downs that nextel peru recognized in the fourth quarter of in connection with the application of fresh start accounting rules 
these write downs substantially reduced the cost bases of certain of nextel peru s long lived assets  resulting in lower depreciation in the overall decrease was also attributable to a decrease in amortization resulting from the reversal of certain valuation allowances for deferred tax assets created in connection with our application of fresh start accounting  which we recorded as a reduction to the intangible assets that existed as of the date of our application of fresh start accounting 
interest expense  net the million  or  decrease in net interest expense from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily a result of less interest expense incurred related to handset financing during compared to as a result of the pay down of outstanding balances  partially offset by interest incurred on nextel peru s million portion of the international equipment facility for which nextel peru became obligated in november nextel peru repaid the outstanding principal balance of this facility in september as a result  nextel peru s interest expense should decrease significantly in future periods

operating revenues and cost of revenues did not significantly change from the year ended december  to the year ended december  because nextel chile s subscriber base remained stable 
general and administrative expenses the million  or  increase in general and administrative expenses from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily due to an increase in other general corporate expenses as a result of increases in corporate business insurance costs  largely due to an increase in insurance premiums and additional insurance policies obtained in  outside services expenses  mainly due to an increase in audit and tax fees  and corporate payroll and related costs 
impairment  restructuring and other charges impairment  restructuring and other charges of million for the year ended december  are primarily related to payments we made to third parties who assisted us with our debt restructuring efforts during and workforce reductions at our corporate headquarters and our chilean operating companies 
depreciation and amortization the million  or  decrease in depreciation and amortization expense from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily due to write downs of all long lived assets recognized at the corporate level and by nextel chile as a result of the application of fresh start accounting rules on october  these write downs substantially reduced the costs bases of our corporate entities and nextel chile s long lived assets and resulted in less depreciation and amortization during than during interest expense  net the million  or  decrease in interest expense  net  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily due to the following the elimination of interest expense on our former senior notes that we extinguished in connection with our emergence from chapter reorganization in  a reduction in interest expense on our former million international equipment facility  which was entirely held at the corporate level until our emergence from reorganization in  at which point only million was held at the corporate level  and an increase in interest income due to higher cash balances at the corporate level as a result of net proceeds received in connection with our stock and note offerings during the third quarter of these increases were partially offset by the following accreted interest on our senior secured discount notes that we issued in november  interest expense that we recognized on the million portion of our international equipment facility held at the corporate level  which we fully paid down in september  interest expense that we recognized on our new convertible notes issued in september  and the recognition of a million loss on the elimination of our interest rate swap in the third quarter of loss gain on extinguishment of debt  net the million net gain on extinguishment of debt for the year ended december  represents a gain we recognized on the settlement of our argentine credit facility in the fourth quarter of we repurchased the million outstanding balance and accrued interest in exchange for million in cash and the issuance of  shares of nii holdings common stock

these gains were partially offset by losses associated with the following write offs and costs a million write off of the unamortized bond discounts on our former senior notes  a million write off of debt financing costs  million in legal  advisory  retention and tax costs  and a million charge resulting from the recording of our assets at their estimated fair values in accordance with fresh start accounting rules

other expense  net  of million for the year ended december  consists mainly of a million write off of accrued interest on an intercompany loan between a corporate affiliate and nextel peru

c 
liquidity and capital resources we had a working capital surplus of million as of december   a million decrease compared to december  the decrease in our working capital is primarily attributable to lower consolidated cash balances resulting primarily from the repayment of our international equipment facility and the repurchase of our senior secured discount notes  partially offset by new financing activities 
we recognized net income of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   million for the two months ended december  and  million for the ten months ended october  net income for the ten months ended october  includes  million in one time non operating reorganization items and a million one time non operating gain on the extinguishment of our argentine credit facility 
our operating expenses and capital expenditures associated with developing  enhancing and operating our digital mobile networks have more than offset our operating revenues in the past 
during  our operating revenues more than offset our operating expenses and cash capital expenditures 
while we expect this trend to continue  if business conditions or timing of capital expenditures change  we may not be able to maintain this trend

we also purchased a foreign currency derivative instrument at a net cost of million 
we did not make similar purchases of short term investments or foreign currency derivative instruments during we used million of net cash in our financing activities during  primarily due to the following million in cash we used to retire substantially all of our senior secured discount notes in connection with our tender offer  million in cash we used to repay our international equipment facility with motorola  and million in cash we used to pay debt financing costs in connection with the issuance of our convertible notes 
partially offset by million in gross proceeds that we raised in connection with the issuance of our convertible notes

d 
future capital needs and resources capital resources 
our ongoing capital resources depend on a variety of factors  including our existing cash balance  cash flows generated by our operating companies and external financial sources that may be available 
as of december   our capital resources included million of cash and available short term investments 
our ability to generate sufficient net cash from our operating activities is dependent upon  among other things the amount of revenue we are able to generate and collect from our customers  the amount of operating expenses required to provide our services  the cost of acquiring and retaining customers  including the subsidies we incur to provide handsets to both our new and existing customers  our ability to continue to grow our customer base  and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
in january  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due for net proceeds of million 
in addition  we granted the initial purchaser an option to purchase up to an additional million principal amount of notes  which the purchaser exercised in february  resulting in an additional million in net proceeds 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per year  payable semi annually in arrears and in cash on february and august of each year  beginning august  the notes will mature on february   unless earlier converted or redeemed by the holders or repurchased by us 
in february  we used the proceeds from the issuance of these notes to prepay  at face value  million of the million in outstanding principal under our international equipment facility 
in addition  in march  nii holdings cayman  ltd  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  completed a cash tender offer to purchase substantially all of its senior secured discount notes due nii holdings cayman  ltd 
financed the tender offer with intercompany loans from nii holdings and cash on hand 
we used a portion of our proceeds from the issuance of our convertible notes to fund these intercompany loans to nii holdings cayman  ltd 
in july  we paid the remaining million in outstanding principal and related accrued interest under our international equipment facility 
in october  we closed on a million  five year syndicated loan facility in mexico 
the facility can be drawn down  under certain conditions  within days from the date of closing 
of the total amount of the facility  million is denominated in us dollars  with a floating interest rate based on libor  million will be denominated in mexican pesos  with a floating interest rate based on the mexican reference rate tiie  and million will be denominated in mexican pesos  at an interest rate fixed at the time of funding 
we intend to hedge the currency and interest rate risks so that the facility is an effective fixed rate mexican peso credit facility 
as of december   we have not drawn on this loan 
under an existing agreement with american tower corporation  during we received million from tower sale leaseback transactions in mexico and brazil 
in addition  nextel brazil has a facility in place under which it can finance handset purchases 
borrowings under this facility have day maturities and interest is prepaid in us dollars at variable market rates 
as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under the nextel brazil handset credit facility 
capital needs 
we currently anticipate that our future capital needs will principally consist of funds required for operating expenses relating to our digital mobile networks  capital expenditures to expand and enhance our digital mobile networks  as discussed below under capital expenditures  future spectrum purchases  debt service requirements  including tower financing obligations  cash taxes  and other general corporate expenditures 
the following table sets forth the amounts and timing of contractual payments for our most significant contractual obligations determined as of december  the information in the table reflects future unconditional payments and is based upon  among other things  the current terms of the relevant agreements  appropriate classification of items under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states that are currently in effect and certain assumptions  such as future interest rates 
future events could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts 
see item k 
risk factors our forward looking statements are subject to a variety of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current beliefs 
except as required by law  we disclaim any obligation to modify or update the information contained in the table 
payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations year years years years total in thousands convertible notes tower financing obligations spectrum acquisition obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual commitments these amounts include estimated principal and interest payments based on our expectations as to future interest rates  assuming the current payment schedule 
these amounts principally include future lease costs  transmitter and receiver sites and switches and office facilities as of december  these amounts represent maximum contractual purchase obligations under various agreements with our vendors 
the amounts due in more than five years include our current estimates of asset retirement obligations based on our expectations as to future retirement costs  inflation rates and timing of retirements 
capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures  including capitalized interest  were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  in the future  we expect to finance our capital spending using the most effective combination of cash from operations  cash on hand  cash from tower sale leaseback transactions  cash available to us under our syndicated loan facility in mexico and any other external financing that becomes available 
our capital spending is driven by several factors  including the construction of additional transmitter and receiver sites to increase system capacity and maintain system quality and the installation of related switching equipment in some of our existing market coverage areas  the enhancement of our digital mobile network coverage around some major market areas  the expansion of our digital mobile networks to new market areas  enhancements to our existing iden technology to increase voice capacity  and non network related information technology projects 
our future capital expenditures will be significantly affected by future technology improvements and technology choices 
in october  motorola and nextel communications announced an anticipated significant technology upgrade to the iden digital mobile network  the voice coder software upgrade 
we have implemented the network software upgrade for this technology and beginning in  we started selling handsets that will operate on the new voice coder 
we expect that this software upgrade will significantly increase our voice capacity for interconnect calls and leverage our existing investment in infrastructure 
we do not expect to realize significant benefits from the operation of the voice coder until after if there are substantial delays in realizing the benefits of the voice coder  we could be required to invest additional capital in our infrastructure to satisfy our network capacity needs 
see forward looking statements 
future outlook 
we believe that our current business plan  which contemplates significant expansions in mexico and some expansions in brazil  will not require any additional external funding  other than the million in cash available to us under our syndicated loan facility in mexico  and we will be able to operate and grow our business while servicing our debt obligations 
our revenues are primarily denominated in foreign currencies 
we expect that if current foreign currency exchange rates do not significantly adversely change  we will continue to generate net income for the foreseeable future 
see forward looking statements 
in making our assessments of a fully funded business plan and net income  we have considered cash  cash equivalents and short term investments on hand and available to fund our operations as of december  of million  expected cash flows from operations  the availability of funding under the syndicated loan facility in mexico  the anticipated level of capital expenditures  the anticipated level of spectrum acquisitions  our scheduled debt service  and cash taxes 
if our business plans change  including as a result of changes in technology  or if we decide to expand into new markets or further in our existing markets  as a result of the construction of additional portions of our network or the acquisition of competitors  or if economic conditions in any of our markets generally  or competitive practices in the mobile wireless telecommunications industry change materially from those currently prevailing or from those now anticipated  or if other presently unexpected circumstances arise that have a material effect on the cash flow or profitability of our mobile wireless business  then the anticipated cash needs of our business as well as the conclusions presented herein as to the adequacy of the available sources of cash and timing on our ability to generate net income could change significantly 
any of these events or circumstances could involve significant additional funding needs in excess of the identified currently available sources  and could require us to raise additional capital to meet those needs 
in addition  we continue to assess the opportunities to raise additional funding on attractive terms and conditions 
however  our ability to seek additional capital  if necessary  is subject to a variety of additional factors that we cannot presently predict with certainty  including the commercial success of our operations  the volatility and demand of the capital markets  and the future market prices of our securities 
e 
effect of inflation and foreign currency exchange our net assets are subject to foreign currency exchange risks since they are primarily maintained in local currencies 
additionally  all of our long term debt except for our tower financing obligations is denominated entirely in us dollars  which exposes us to foreign currency exchange risks 
nextel argentina  nextel brazil and nextel mexico conduct business in countries in which the rate of inflation has historically been significantly higher than that of the united states 
we seek to protect our earnings from inflation and possible currency devaluation by periodically adjusting the local currency prices charged by each operating company for sales of handsets and services to its customers 
we routinely monitor our foreign currency exposure and the cost effectiveness of hedging instruments 
in november  nextel mexico entered into a hedge agreement to reduce its foreign currency transaction risk associated with a significant portion of its us dollar forecasted capital expenditures and handset purchases 
this risk is hedged by forecasting nextel mexico s capital expenditures and handset purchases on a month period beginning in january inflation is not currently a material factor affecting our business 
general operating expenses such as salaries  employee benefits and lease costs are  however  subject to normal inflationary pressures 
from time to time  we may experience price changes in connection with the purchase of system infrastructure equipment and handsets  but we do not currently believe that any of these price changes will be material to our business

effect of new accounting standards in march  the emerging issues task force  or eitf  reached a final consensus on issue no 
 participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
 earnings per share  or eitf no 
eitf no 
addresses a number of questions regarding the computation of earnings per share eps by companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends and earnings of the company when  and if  it declares dividends on its common stock 
the issue also provides further guidance in applying the two class method of calculating eps 
it clarifies what constitutes a participating security and how to apply the two class method of computing eps once it is determined that a security is participating  including how to allocate undistributed earnings to such a security 
eitf no 
is effective for the fiscal quarter ended june  the adoption of eitf no 
did not have a material impact on our basic or diluted earnings per share 
in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement no 
revised  employer s disclosure about pensions and other post retirement benefits  or sfas r  to improve financial statement disclosures for defined benefit plans 
sfas r replaces the existing disclosure requirements for pensions  including foreign plans 
the standard requires additional disclosures regarding plan assets  obligations  cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit post retirement plans

in september  the eitf reached a final consensus on issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt and the effect on diluted earnings per share  or eitf no 
eitf no 
states that contingently convertible debt should be included in diluted earnings per share computations  if dilutive  regardless of whether the market price trigger or other contingent feature has been met 
eitf no 
is effective for all periods ending after december  and will be applied by retroactively restating previously reported eps 
we adopted eitf no 
in the fourth quarter of the adoption of eitf no 
requires us to include the additional common shares associated with the conversion of our convertible notes in diluted earnings per share computations  if dilutive  and also requires us to present our previously reported eps on a comparable basis  regardless of whether the market price trigger or other contingent feature has been met 
in december  the fasb issued its final standard on accounting for share based payments sbp  statement no 
r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  or sfas r  that requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options and similar awards 
sfas r is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after june  and applies to all outstanding and unvested sbp awards at a company s adoption date 
the adoption of sfas r will require us to treat the fair value of sbp awards that are within its scope as compensation expense in the income statement beginning on the date that we grant the awards to employees 
we are currently evaluating which methodology we will utilize and have not yet determined the impact to our consolidated financial statements
