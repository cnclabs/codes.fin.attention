critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to uncollectible accounts receivable  inventories  intangibles and other long lived assets 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements o the company maintains allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
o the company carries inventories at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management write downs may be required 
o property  plant and equipment  patents  trademarks and other intangible assets owned by the company are amortized  over their estimated useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates over the period that such assets will generate revenue 
intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying capital investments or intangible assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of such assets  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future
