during the fourth quarter  the synergy worldwide segment established a subsidiary in japan and began shipping the majority of its products to its japanese distributors directly from its warehouse in japan 
the result of this conversion was a decrease in the amount of revenue recognized by the company due to the decrease in shipping and handling fees charged by the company to its japanese distributors under its personal import program

costs and expenses our costs and expenses  which include cost of goods sold  the commission portion of volume incentives  and selling  general and administrative  are identified as a percent of net sales revenue in the table below year ended december cost of goods sold volume incentives selling  general and administrative cost of goods sold cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales revenue decreased in and compared to primarily as a result of decreased importation costs in several of our international operations  increased efficiency gained from our expanded manufacturing facility  and increased net sales revenue in our synergy worldwide operations where costs of goods sold are lower as a percent of net sales revenue 
management believes that cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales revenue will remain relatively constant during as compared to volume incentives volume incentives are a significant part of our direct sales marketing program and represent commission payments made to our independent distributors and managers 
these payments are designed to provide incentives for reaching higher sales levels and for recruiting additional distributors 
volume incentives as a percent of net sales revenue increased slightly during as compared to and  primarily as a result of the increased sales revenue in our synergy worldwide business segment where volume incentives are slightly higher than in the united states and our other international operations 
as required by eitf  we have presented million  million  and million in volume incentive rebates as a reduction in revenue for   and  respectively 
as a result  volume incentive expense is lower by those same amounts in each respective year 
this presentation has no impact on operating income  net income  or earnings per basic or diluted common share 
management expects volume incentives as a percent of net sales revenue to increase slightly during as compared to due to increased sales levels in our synergy worldwide business segment where volume incentives are slightly higher 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in compared to as a result of expenses related to the synergy worldwide business segment expansion 
in  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million as compared to  primarily as a result of expenses incurred to restructure several of our operations and consolidate various employee functions 
approximately million of the increase in was related to cost cutting programs designed to eliminate and consolidate various management and employee functions and realign programs and market strategies  and increased expenses in our synergy worldwide business segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales revenue decreased to percent in compared to percent in and percent in this category includes costs for research and development  distribution  and incentive programs such as our conventions 
we believe that selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales revenue will decrease during as compared to due to continued cost containment measures and increased net sales revenue 
in our international and synergy worldwide business segments  reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses are planned in our south korea  japan  and brazil operations 
income taxes the effective income tax rate was percent for  compared to percent for  and percent for the decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to a detailed income tax study of its foreign tax assets which resulted in a benefit of approximately million 
the income tax rate in is not indicative of the effective tax rate for product liability similar to other manufacturers and distributors of products that are ingested  we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that  among other things  the use of our products results in injury 
as a result of increased regulatory scrutiny of products that contain ephedrine alkaloids and kava  we have not been able to obtain product liability insurance covering such products 
as of april   we complied with the us food and drug administration s ban on the ingredient ephedra 
when we discontinued the use of ephedrine alkaloids  less than percent of our products contained some amount of ephedrine alkaloids 
we carry insurance in the types and amounts we consider reasonably adequate to cover the risks associated with our business 
on june   we established a wholly owned captive insurance company to provide us with product liability insurance coverage 
we have accrued an amount using the assistance of a third party actuary that we believe is sufficient to cover probable and reasonably estimable liabilities related to product liability claims based on our history of such claims 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will prove to be sufficient nor can there be any assurance that the ultimate outcome of any litigation for product liability will not have a material negative impact on our business prospects  financial position  results of operations  or liquidity 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   we generated cash from operating activities of million compared to million in the increase in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net income and accrued liabilities offset  in part  by an increase in inventory 
capital expenditures were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the high level of capital expenditures in was primarily due to the expansion of our synergy worldwide business segment 
capital expenditures were primarily for equipment  computer systems and software  office furniture  and leasehold improvements made to enhance existing operations as well as the expansion of international markets 
on october   we commenced a dutch auction tender offer for up to  shares of our common stock  at a price not greater than nor less than per share 
the tender offer expired at midnight on november  a total of approximately  shares of common stock were properly tendered and not withdrawn at or below per share 
we purchased an aggregate of  shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share 
the resulting proration factor for the tender offer was approximately 
the tender offer was funded with available cash and borrowings under our million unsecured line of credit 
during  we entered into an operating line of credit agreement providing for borrowings of up to million 
the proceeds from this line of credit may be used to repurchase common shares of our outstanding stock under board authorized repurchase programs as well as to fund working capital  capital expenditures  and related costs 
as of december   we had an outstanding balance of million on this line of credit 
proceeds from the line of credit were used to purchase approximately  shares of our stock under a board authorized dutch auction tender offer 
we amended the terms of the line of credit during the second quarter of to extend the maturity date to july  the line of credit had an original maturity of july  as of december   we are in compliance with all financial covenants 
we intend to pay off the line of credit during using cash generated from operating activities 
additional information with respect to this line of credit is set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
we have certain commitments related to operating leases as set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
we believe that our working capital requirements can be met through our available cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities for the foreseeable future  however  a prolonged economic downturn or a decrease in the demand for our products could adversely affect our long term liquidity 
in the event of a significant decrease in cash provided by our operating activities  we might need to obtain additional external sources of funding 
we currently maintain an operating line of credit allowing for borrowings of up to million of which million has been borrowed as of december  the proceeds from this line of credit may be used to repurchase common shares  as well as to fund working capital requirements 
the line of credit contains other terms and conditions as well as affirmative and negative financial covenants 
as of december  we were in compliance with these covenants 
we do not currently maintain a long term credit facility or any other external sources of long term funding  however  we believe that such funding could be obtained on competitive terms in the event additional sources of funds become necessary 
the following table summarizes information about contractual obligations as of december  total less than year years years after years line of credit operating leases total contractual obligations key accounting policies our accounting policies are more fully described in the note of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize sales revenue when products are shipped and title passes to our independent distributors 
for most product sales  the sales price is received in the form of cash or credit card payment  which accompanies or precedes the shipment of the product 
sales revenue is recorded net of the rebate portion of volume incentives 
further information related to volume incentives is set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of the report 
as products are shipped  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
a reserve for product returns  which reduces revenue  is accrued based on historical experience 
from time to time  our united states business segment extends short term credit associated with product promotions 
for certain of our international operations  we offer credit terms consistent with industry standards within the country of operation 
amounts received for unshipped merchandise are not recognized as revenue but rather they are recorded as customer deposits and are included in accrued liabilities 
volume incentives accrual we accrue for expenses for volume incentives associated with our net sales revenue 
volume incentives are a significant part of our direct sales marketing program and represent payments made to our independent distributors and managers 
as required by eitf  we record rebates as a reduction in revenue 
as a result  volume incentive expense is reduced by the corresponding amounts each year 
we specifically analyze volume incentives based on historical and current sales trends when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued volume incentives 
self insurance liabilities we self insure for certain employee medical and product liabilities 
the recorded liabilities for self insured risks are calculated using actuarial methods and are not discounted 
the liabilities include amounts for actual claims and claims incurred but not reported 
actual experience  including claim frequency and severity as well as health care inflation  could result in actual liabilities being more or less than the amounts currently recorded 
incentive trip accrual we accrue for expenses for incentive trips associated with our direct sales marketing program  which rewards independent distributors and managers with paid attendance at our conventions and meetings 
expenses associated with incentive trips are accrued over qualification periods as they are earned 
we specifically analyze incentive trip accruals based on historical and current sales trends as well as contractual obligations when evaluating the adequacy of the incentive trip accrual 
actual results could result in liabilities being more or less than the amounts recorded 
we have accrued convention and meeting costs of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is effective for reporting periods beginning after june  third quarter for us 
sfas no 
r requires us to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for our equity instruments 
currently  in accordance with apb opinion  we record the intrinsic value of stock based compensation as expense 
accordingly  no compensation expense is currently recognized for fixed stock option plans as the exercise price equals the stock price on the date of grant 
under sfas no 
r  we will be required to measure compensation expense over the stock options vesting period based on the stock options fair value at the date the options are granted 
sfas no 
r allows for the use of the black scholes or a lattice option pricing model to value such options 
we have determined that we will use the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of our options 
as allowed by sfas no 
r  we can elect either modified prospective application  which applies sfas no 
r to new awards and modified awards after the effective date  and to any unvested awards as service is rendered on or after the effective date  or modified retrospective application which can apply sfas no 
r to either all prior years for which sfas no 
was effective or only to prior interim periods in the year of adoption 
we are currently evaluating which method of application will be used 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements illustrates the effects on net income and earnings per share if we had adopted sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  using the black scholes option pricing model 
management does not believe the adoption will have a material effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  which requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  the statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company will adopt this statement as required  and management does not believe the adoption will have a material effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we conduct business in several countries and intend to continue to expand our international operations 
net sales revenue  operating income  and net income are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  interest rates and other uncertainties inherent in doing business and selling product in more than one currency 
in addition  our operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in social  political  and economic conditions inherent in international operations  including changes in the laws and policies that govern international investment in countries where we have operations as well as  to a lesser extent  changes in united states laws and regulations relating to international trade and investment 
foreign currency risk during the year ended december   approximately percent of our net sales revenue and approximately percent of our expenses were realized outside of the united states 
inventory purchases are transacted primarily in us dollars from vendors located in the united states 
the local currency of each international subsidiary is considered the functional currency  and all revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the periods reported 
therefore  reported sales and expenses will be positively impacted by a weakening of the us dollar and will be negatively impacted by a strengthening of the us dollar 
given the uncertainty of exchange rate fluctuations  we cannot estimate the effect of these fluctuations on our future business  product pricing  results of operations  or financial condition 
changes in currency exchange rates affect the relative prices at which we sell our products 
we regularly monitor our foreign currency risks and periodically take measures to reduce the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results 
we do not use derivative instruments for hedging  trading  or speculating on foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the following table sets forth average currency exchange rates of one us dollar into local currency for each of the currencies in which sales revenue exceeded million during any of the years presented 
year ended december canada japan mexico south korea venezuela during and venezuela experienced a significant devaluation in the bolivar  which adversely affected the results of operations 
continued devaluation could adversely affect the results of operations in future periods 
during the first quarter of  management determined based on the three year cumulative inflation rate that the dominican republic is highly inflationary and will be accounted for in accordance with fas we believe that this change in functional currency will not have a material effect upon our results of operations  liquidity or financial position 
interest rate risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by purchasing investment grade securities  substantially all of which either mature within the next months or have characteristics of marketable securities 
at december   we had investments of million of which million were municipal obligations  which carry an average fixed interest rate of percent and mature over a year period 
a hypothetical percent change in interest rates would not have had a material effect on our liquidity  financial position  or results of operations
