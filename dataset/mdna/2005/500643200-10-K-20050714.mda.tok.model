executive summary we are the leading provider of executive search  outsourced recruiting and leadership development solutions with the broadest global presence in the recruitment industry 
our services include executive recruitment  middle management recruitment through futurestep  outsourced recruitment  leadership development solutions and executive coaching 
over half of the executive recruitment searches we performed in fiscal were for board level  chief executive and other senior executive and general management positions 
our  clients in fiscal included approximately of the fortune companies 
we have established strong client loyalty  more than of the executive recruitment assignments we performed in fiscal were on behalf of clients for whom we had conducted assignments in the previous three fiscal years 
in an effort to achieve our long term vision of being the leading provider of executive search  outsourced recruiting and leadership development solutions  our strategic focus for fiscal will center upon increasing market share and further increasing the cross selling and utilization of our multi product strategy 
we will continue to explore new products and services  enhance our technology and processes and aggressively leverage our brand through thought leadership and intellectual capital projects as a means of delivering world class service to our clients 
fee revenue increased in fiscal year to million with increases in all regions 
the north american region experienced the largest dollar increase in fee revenue in both executive recruitment and futurestep 
in fiscal  we earned an operating profit of million with operating income from executive recruitment of million and million from futurestep  partially offset by corporate expenses of million 
our total long term debt at april  was million 
our working capital increased million to million at april  cash provided by operating activities increased million to million in fiscal year as a result of improved operating results and increase in current liabilities 

table of contents during fiscal year  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes in lieu of cash interest payments and million of convertible series a preferred stock in lieu of cash dividends 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements 
preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions 
in preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  we apply our accounting policies as disclosed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we consider the policies discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition 
management is required to establish policies and procedures to ensure that revenue is recorded over the performance period for valid engagements and related costs are matched against such revenue 
we provide recruitment services on a retained basis and generally bill clients in three monthly installments 
since the fees are generally not contingent upon placement of a candidate  our assumptions primarily relate to establishing the period over which such service is performed 
these assumptions determine the timing of revenue recognition and profitability for the reported period 
if these assumptions do not accurately reflect the period over which revenue is earned  revenue and profit could differ 
any services that are provided on a contingent basis are recognized once the contingency is fulfilled 
deferred compensation 
estimating deferred compensation requires assumptions regarding the timing and probability of payments of benefits to participants and the discount rate 
changes in these assumptions would significantly impact the liability and related cost on our balance sheet and statement of operations 
management engages an independent actuary to review these assumptions periodically in order to ensure that they reflect the population and economics of our deferred compensation plans in all material respects and to assist us in estimating our deferred compensation liability and the related cost 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ from actual results due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population 
these differences could have a significant impact on our deferred compensation liability and the related cost 
carrying values 
valuations are required under us generally accepted accounting principles to determine the carrying value of various assets 
our most significant assets for which management is required to prepare valuations are goodwill and deferred income taxes 
management must identify whether events have occurred that may impact the carrying value of these assets and make assumptions regarding future events  such as profitability 
differences between the assumptions used to prepare these valuations and actual results could materially impact the carrying amount of these assets and our operating results

table of contents quarterly results the following table sets forth certain unaudited statement of operations data for the quarters in fiscal and the unaudited quarterly information has been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and  in management s opinion  includes all adjustments necessary to present fairly the information for the quarters presented dollars in thousands  except per share amounts 
quarters ended fiscal fiscal april jan 
oct 
july april jan 
oct 
july fee revenue operating income loss net income loss net income loss per share basic diluted we incurred restructuring charges of  in the first quarter of comprised of a  of severance restructuring costs  b  of facilities restructuring costs and c related to the write down of related assets  primarily property and equipment 
excluding restructuring charges  net loss would have been for the first quarter of fiscal recently issued accounting standards on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised statement r  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation statement 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r is required to be adopted in fiscal years beginning after june  we expect to adopt statement r on may  using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by statement  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have an impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time as it depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings loss per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our global operating activities  we are exposed to certain market risks  including foreign currency exchange fluctuations and fluctuations in interest 
we manage our exposure to these risks in the normal course of our business as described below 
we have not utilized financial instruments for trading  hedging or other speculative purposes nor do we trade in derivative financial instruments 

table of contents foreign currency risk substantially all our foreign subsidiaries operations are measured in their local currencies 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the end of each reporting period and revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the reporting period 
resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of comprehensive income on our statement of stockholders equity 
transactions denominated in a currency other than the reporting entity s functional currency may give rise to transaction gains and losses that impact our results of operations 
historically  we have not realized significant foreign currency gains or losses on such transactions 
in the year ended april   we recognized foreign currency losses  after income taxes  of million primarily related to our europe operations 
our primary exposure to exchange losses is based on outstanding inter company loan balances denominated in us dollars 
if the us dollar strengthened  and against pounds sterling  the euro  the canadian dollar  the australian dollar and the yen  the company s exchange loss would have been million  million and million  respectively  based on outstanding balances at april  interest rate risk we primarily manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through our regular financing activities  which generally are short term and provide for variable market rates 
as of april   we had no outstanding balance on our credit facility 
we have million of borrowings against the cash surrender value of coli contracts as of april  bearing interest primarily at variable rates 
the risk of fluctuations in these variable rates is minimized by the fact that we receive a corresponding adjustment to our borrowed funds crediting rate on the cash surrender value on our coli contracts 
in june  we issued million of convertible debt and million of convertible preferred stock that is mandatorily redeemable by us if still outstanding on june  the convertible debt and preferred stock approximates its fair value at april
