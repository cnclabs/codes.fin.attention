item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report and the section of this report titled factors that may affect future results 
overview and executive summary in march  we became a reseller and service provider of emc automated networked storage tm systems and software  pursuant to a reseller agreement with emc corporation 
the shift in strategy from a developer of technology to a reseller of third party solutions has had the following primary financial implications we have significantly increased product revenue in the past two years 
we recorded product revenue of million in fiscal  a increase from fiscal and significantly increased the number of new customers 
in order to achieve this revenue growth  we invested heavily in sales and service resources which led to increased losses in fiscal maintenance revenue has been negatively impacted due to the comprehensive warranty carried by emc products 
we resell emc hardware products with up to a three year warranty with a seven day  twenty four hour service level 
in contrast  mti proprietary products were generally sold with a one year warranty with a five day  nine hour service level 
therefore  the sale of proprietary products provided an opportunity to generate maintenance revenue earlier due to the shorter warranty period and allowed the company to generate maintenance revenue during the warranty period by selling maintenance contracts increasing the service level to seven days a week  twenty four hours a day 
in fiscal  we were successful in offsetting the decline in our legacy maintenance base with increased professional service revenue as well as software maintenance contracts on new technology installations 
we eliminated research and development costs and significantly reduced manufacturing and marketing expenses 
these cost reductions were primarily the result of reductions in staff and the abandonment of underutilized facilities 
as a product reseller  we have experienced reduced product margins due to the reliance on emc to develop and manufacture the products we resell 
the results of operations in fiscal were significantly impacted by an investment in our sales and professional services businesses and restructuring charges recorded related to the closure of our dublin  ireland manufacturing and logistics facility 
this closure represented one of the final steps in fully transitioning to our new business model 
we believe that our new business strategy continues to provide a significant opportunity to grow revenues and achieve profitability 
in order to be successful we must leverage the investment we have made in our service business 
our exclusive reliance on emc products as our core product solution has inherent challenges  such as obtaining sufficient product quantities to satisfy customer requirements  developing the ability to ship products to meet customer imposed deadlines  developing the ability to control the cost of the product  and reliance on the ability of emc to respond to changing technology 

table of contents outlook the following information summarizes management s outlook for fiscal we expect that service revenue will continue to increase during fiscal due to anticipated growth in our professional service business as well as continued sales of software and hardware maintenance contracts 
we expect this growth to follow the integration of our newly hired personnel and the expiration of warranties on emc products sold in fiscal in addition  if sales of emc products increase  we would expect that sales of related software and back up products  which typically carry shorter warranty periods  would also increase and provide an opportunity for increased maintenance contracts 
in fiscal  we plan to moderate our headcount additions and focus on improving the efficiency and utilization of our professional services delivery 
we expect that product revenue will continue to grow during fiscal as we strive to leverage the investment we have made in increased sales headcount 
we expect that our total solutions provider strategy will allow us to further penetrate the mid enterprise storage market and continue to add new name accounts 
if we are able to successfully execute our strategy  we anticipate future net product margins to range between and 
this margin increase is expected to be driven primarily by the introduction of additional product offerings 
in fiscal  we plan to leverage the investment we have made in our services business and expect service margin percentage to improve as a result of more efficient delivery of our professional service offerings  additional service offerings  and increased maintenance revenue from the sale of software and hardware contracts on emc products 
we believe that as we continue to execute our strategy  we will see improved liquidity through cash generated by operating activities 
we believe that our current working capital and availability under the comerica credit facility is adequate to fund operations at least through fiscal however  if we are not successful in growing revenues and improving margins  it may be necessary to seek additional sources of financing 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and could potentially produce materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
for a detailed discussion of the application of the following critical accounting policies and other accounting policies  see notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue from sales of products and services 
the following summarizes the major terms of the contractual relationships with customers and the manner in which we account for sales transactions 
hardware revenue hardware revenue consists of the sale of disk and tape based hardware 
we recognize revenue pursuant to emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
in 
table of contents accordance with these revenue recognition guidelines  revenue is recognized for a unit of accounting when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred fee is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured generally  product sales are not contingent upon customer testing  approval and or acceptance 
however  if sales require customer acceptance  revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance 
product sales with post delivery obligations generally relate to professional services  including installation services or other projects 
professional services revenue is not recognized until the services have been completed  while product revenue is recognized at time of shipment as the services do not affect the functionality of the delivered items 
in transactions where we sell directly to an end user  generally there are no acceptance clauses 
however  we also sell to leasing companies who in turn lease the product to their lessee  the end user 
for this type of sale  generally there are lessee acceptance criteria in the purchase order or contract 
for these transactions  we defer the revenue until written acceptance is received from the lessee 
credit terms to customers typically range from net to net days after shipment 
product returns are estimated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
statement  revenue recognition when right of return exists 
customers have a limited right of return which allows them to return non conforming products 
accordingly  reserves for estimated future returns are provided in the period of sale based on contractual terms and historical data and are recorded as a reduction of revenue 
we also ensure that the other criteria in statement have been met prior to recognition of revenue the price is fixed or determinable  the customer is obligated to pay and there are no contingencies surrounding the obligation or the payment  the customer s obligation would not change in the event of theft or damage to the product  the customer has economic substance  the amount of returns can be reasonably estimated and mti does not have significant obligations for future performance in order to bring about resale of the product by the customer 
software revenue we sell various software products ranging from software that is embedded in the hardware to add on software that is sold on a stand alone basis 
software that is embedded in the hardware consists of tools that provide a user interface and assist the customer in the configuration of storage disks as well as provide performance monitoring and troubleshooting features 
this software can not be sold on a stand alone basis and is not a significant part of sales or marketing efforts 
this embedded software is considered incidental to the hardware and is not recognized as a separate unit of accounting apart from the hardware 
if a maintenance contract is sold related to this software  it is accounted for in accordance with eitf  whereby the total arrangement revenue is first allocated to the maintenance contract based on fair value and the remaining arrangement revenue is allocated to the hardware elements in the transaction 
revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
we also sell application software that is sold as add on software to existing hardware configurations 
this software is generally loaded onto a customers host cpu and provides additional functionality to the storage environment  such as assisting in data back up  data migration and mirroring data to remote locations 
based on the factors described in footnote two of sop  we consider this type of software to be more than incidental to hardware components in an arrangement 
this assessment is based on the fact that the software can be sold on a stand alone basis and that generally  maintenance contracts are sold with the software 
software products that are considered more than incidental are treated as a separate unit of accounting apart from the hardware 
we account for software that is more than incidental in accordance with sop  as amended by sop  whereby the total arrangement revenue is first allocated to the software maintenance contract based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
vsoe is established based on stand alone renewal rates 
the remaining revenue from 
table of contents the sale of software products is recognized at the time the software is delivered to the customer  provided all the revenue recognition criteria noted above have been met  except collectibility must be deemed probable under sop versus reasonably assured under sab in transactions where the software is considered more than incidental to the hardware in the arrangement  we also consider eitf  applicability of aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software eitf 
per eitf  if the software is considered not essential to the functionality of the hardware  then the hardware is not considered software related and is excluded from the scope of sop all software sold by mti is not essential to the functionality of the hardware 
the software adds additional features and functionality to the hardware and allows the customer to perform additional tasks in their storage environment 
the hardware is not dependent upon the software to function and the customer can fully utilize the hardware product without any of the software products 
therefore  in multiple element arrangements containing hardware and software  the hardware elements are excluded from sop and are accounted for under eitf and sab service revenue service revenue is generated from the sale of professional services  maintenance contracts and time and materials billings 
the following describes how we account for service transactions  provided all the other revenue recognition criteria noted above have been met 
generally  professional services revenue  which includes installation  training  consulting and engineering services  is recognized upon completion of the services 
if the professional service project includes independent milestones  revenue is recognized as milestones are met and upon acceptance from the customer 
maintenance revenue is generated from the sale of hardware and software maintenance contracts 
these contracts generally range from one to three years 
maintenance revenue is recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the related agreement 
multiple element arrangements we consider sales contracts that include a combination of systems  software or services to be multiple element arrangements 
revenue related to multiple element arrangements is separated in accordance with eitf and sop if an arrangement includes undelivered elements we use the residual method  whereby we defer the fair value of the undelivered elements with the residual revenue allocated to the delivered elements 
discounts are allocated only to the delivered elements 
fair value is determined by examining renewed service contracts and based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately or  for transactions accounted for under eitf  prices provided by vendors if sufficient standalone sales information is not available 
undelivered elements typically include installation  training  warranty  maintenance and professional services 
other we consider sales transactions that are initiated by emc and jointly negotiated and closed by emc and mti s sales force as partner assisted transactions pats 
we recognize revenue from pats on a gross basis  in accordance with eitf  because we bear the risk of returns and collectability of the full accounts receivable 
product revenue for the delivered items is recorded at residual value upon pickup by a common carrier for free carrier fca origin shipments 
for fca destination shipments  product revenue is recorded upon delivery to the customer 
if we subcontract the undelivered items such as maintenance and professional services to emc or other third parties  we record the costs of those items as deferred costs and amortize the costs using the straight line method over the life of the contract 
we defer the revenue for the undelivered items at fair value based upon list prices with emc according to eitf at times  our 
table of contents customers may prefer to enter into service agreements directly with emc 
in such instances  we may assign the obligation to perform services to emc  or other third parties  and therefore we do not record revenue nor defer any costs related to the services 
for certain sales transactions  an escrow account is utilized to facilitate payment obligations between all parties involved in the transaction 
in these transactions  generally the end user or lessor will fund payment into the escrow account and the bank will distribute the payment to each party in the transaction pursuant to mutually agreed upon escrow instructions 
we only receive cash which represents the net margin on the sales transaction 
for these transactions  we recognize revenue on a net basis as we do not bear credit risk in the transaction 
we may allow customers that purchase new equipment to trade in used equipment to reduce the purchase price under the sales contract 
these trade in credits are considered discounts and are allocated to the delivered elements in accordance with eitf thus  product revenue from trade in transactions is recognized net of trade in value 
shipping products are generally drop shipped directly from suppliers to our customers 
upon the supplier s delivery to a carrier  title and risk of loss pass to mti 
revenue is recognized at the time of shipment when shipping terms are free carrier fca shipping point as legal title and risk of loss to the product pass to the customer 
for fca destination shipments  revenue is recorded upon delivery to the customer 
for legacy mti product sales during and previously  product was shipped from our facility in ireland 
subsequent to the closure of the ireland facility  legacy product is shipped from our facility in england 
mti retains title and risk of loss until the product clears us customs and therefore revenue is not recognized until the product clears customs for fca origin shipments and upon delivery to the customer for fca destination shipments 
significant estimates which impact the timing and classification of revenue involve the calculation of fair value of the undelivered elements in a multi element arrangement 
if the fair value of the undelivered elements changes  the timing and classification of revenue could be impacted 
product warranty 
we maintain a warranty accrual for the estimated future warranty obligation based upon the relationship between historical and anticipated costs and sales volumes 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units sold  historical and anticipated rates of warranty calls and repair cost 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  we reviewed our historical costs of warranty for emc products sold since the inception of the reseller agreement with emc on march  we have updated this review on a quarterly basis through the fourth quarter of fiscal year based on these reviews  and given the favorable warranty rate experienced on emc products  we determined that it was not necessary to record any additional provision for warranty related to emc products for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year and in the first quarter of fiscal year in the second quarter of fiscal year  we began recording additional warranty provision based on expected future warranty claims 
we will continue to assess the adequacy of the warranty accrual each quarter 
should actual warranty calls and repair cost differ from our estimates  the amount of actual warranty costs could materially differ from our estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated returns and losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments for products sold or services rendered 
we analyze accounts receivable  including past due balances  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
all new customers are reviewed for credit worthiness upon initiation of the sales process 
historically  we have not experienced significant losses on accounts receivable  however  if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes 
we are required to estimate our income taxes  which includes estimating our current income taxes as well as measuring the temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets or liabilities 
we apply 
table of contents statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes statement  under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse  net of a valuation allowance 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as management has determined that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be utilized 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates  our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
valuation of goodwill 
we assess the impairment of goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
goodwill and other intangible assets statement on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
we completed our annual assessment for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year based upon factors such as the market valuation approach  comparison between the reporting units estimated fair value using discounted cash flow projections over the next three years  and carrying value  we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill 
changes in assumptions and estimates included within this analysis could produce significantly different results than those identified above and those recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
inventories 
our inventory consists of logistics inventory and production inventory 
logistics inventory is used for product under maintenance contracts and warranty  and is not held for re sale 
as of april   we had net logistics inventory of million  the majority of which is related to legacy products  and net production inventory of million 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market  net of an allowance for obsolete  slow moving  and unsalable inventory 
the allowance is based upon management s review of inventories on hand  historical product sales  and future sales forecasts 
historically  we used rolling forecasts based upon anticipated product orders to determine our component and product inventory requirements 
as a reseller  we procure inventory primarily upon receipt of purchase orders from customers  as such  the risk of emc production inventory obsolescence is low 
during fiscal  we recorded an inventory provision of million primarily related to a write down of our legacy logistics inventory 
the logistics inventory was written down due to the continued decline in our legacy product installed base which led to a revised estimate of remaining useful life of certain spare parts 
this revised estimate was calculated based on a review of legacy product lifecycles and comparison to current and projected legacy maintenance revenue 
as maintenance contracts expire and are not renewed  the amount of logistics inventory needed to support the legacy installed base decreases 
management continually evaluates the useful life of the logistics inventory relative to the remaining legacy maintenance contracts 
if we overestimate our product or component requirements  we may have excess inventory  which could lead to additional excess and obsolete charges 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected items from the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated  except for product gross profit and service gross profit  
table of contents which are expressed as a percentage of the related revenue 
this information should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein fiscal year ended april  april  april  net product revenue service revenue total revenue product gross profit service gross profit gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development restructuring charges operating loss other income expense  net gain on foreign currency transactions income tax expense benefit net loss fiscal year compared to fiscal year net product revenue the components of product revenue by geographic region for fiscal and are shown in the table below in millions fiscal year ended april  april  change us europe total product revenue net product revenue for fiscal increased million  or from fiscal this increase was comprised of a million and million increase in domestic and international product revenue  respectively 
we experienced a greater percentage increase in domestic product sales primarily due to a more focused effort on adding headcount to the us sales force in fiscal the increase in net product revenue was primarily the result of further leveraging our reseller relationship with emc 
our emc reseller agreement was entered into in the fourth quarter of fiscal year our ability to sell emc products has enabled us to further penetrate the mid range storage market 
as of april   we had a total worldwide sales headcount of compared to as of april  this increase in headcount has enabled us to sell products to hundreds of new name accounts across a number of new regions 
the increase was driven primarily by strong demand for emc server and software products  which generally have a higher average selling price than our former  proprietary products 
server and software product revenue for fiscal increased from fiscal by million and million  respectively 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in tape library product revenue 
the decrease in tape library revenue is attributable to a shift in focus towards developing expertise selling the emc product set 
server  software and library revenue accounted for  and of total product revenue in fiscal as compared to  and in fiscal  respectively 
for fiscal year  sales of emc products represented million  or of total product revenue compared with million or of total product revenue for fiscal we ended fiscal with a product order backlog of million 

table of contents service revenue the components of service revenue for fiscal and are shown in the table below in millions fiscal year fiscal year us europe total us europe total professional services revenue maintenance revenue total service revenue total service revenue in fiscal increased million  or from fiscal the net increase was attributable to an increase in professional services revenue of million  partially offset by a decrease in maintenance revenue of million 
the decline in maintenance revenue was primarily related to the following factors 
in march  we became a reseller and service provider of emc automated networked storage systems and software 
most emc hardware products are sold with up to a year x warranty 
as a result  any revenue associated with post warranty service contracts for those hardware product sales would not occur until expiration of the warranty period 
this factor  along with declining renewal rates of legacy maintenance contracts  caused maintenance revenue to decrease compared to fiscal during fiscal  we began to replace the decline in legacy maintenance revenue with increased revenue from new software maintenance contracts 
professional services revenue for fiscal increased million or from fiscal the growth in professional services revenue was the result of increased product sales which provided the opportunity to generate service revenue through the performance of installation and configuration services  as well as the ability to sell more complex professional service engagements 
we have made a focused effort to grow our professional service business and have added significant headcount and resources to this area 
as of april   we had service employees compared to as of april  product gross profit product gross profit was million for fiscal  an increase of million or from fiscal the gross profit percentage for net product sales was for fiscal compared to for fiscal there were three primary factors that impacted the product gross profit percentage during fiscal product mix  inventory provision and rebates earned 
a change in product mix had a negative impact on product gross profit margins compared to fiscal the sale of emc products accounted for of product revenue in fiscal  compared to in fiscal generally  sales of our legacy products had higher profit margins compared to emc products 
product gross profit for fiscal was negatively impacted by approximately million in production inventory related charges as compared to only million in such charges in fiscal partially offsetting these first two factors was the favorable impact of rebates recorded in fiscal year in the first quarter of fiscal  we became an emc premier velocity partner  which has allowed us to earn certain performance based rebates 
in fiscal we recorded performance rebates of million 
no rebates were earned in fiscal year  resulting in a favorable impact to product margin percentage in we believe that the product gross profit percentage for fiscal year reflects the factors discussed above as well as lower profit margins experienced on a transaction by transaction basis 
service gross profit service gross profit was million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or from fiscal the service gross profit percentage was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in service gross profit percentage is primarily due to the combination of a shift in the composition of service revenue  an increase in service expenses related to additional professional services personnel added and the impact of logistics inventory provision of million 
as noted above  in fiscal maintenance revenue decreased million and professional service revenue increased million compared to fiscal professional services revenue represented of total service revenue for fiscal compared to for fiscal in order to drive increased professional services revenue and as an investment in growing our professional services business  we incurred increased expenses related to salary and benefits and travel and lodging 
also contributing to the decrease in service gross profit percentage was the decrease in maintenance revenue which is supported by a relatively fixed cost structure 
service gross profit in fiscal was 
table of contents negatively impacted by a write down of logistics inventory of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the write down was due to the continued decline in our legacy maintenance base which resulted in a revised estimate of the remaining useful life of certain spare parts 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased million  or from fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were as compared to for fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in salaries and related benefits of million  an increase in travel and lodging expenses of million and an increase in outside purchases of million 
the increase in salaries and related benefits expense was attributable to an increase of employees in sales  marketing and g a departments compared to april   as well as increased commission expense as a result of increased sales 
the increase in travel and lodging expenses was also primarily the result of increased headcount in our sales organization 
the increase in outside purchases was primarily related to increases in employment recruiting fees  audit and consulting fees related to sarbanes oxley compliance  marketing consulting fees and legal fees 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced plans to restructure our european operations as discussed below under restructuring 
research and development we did not incur research and development expenses during fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal year  we eliminated research and development expenditures due to our strategy shift from a producer of proprietary products to a reseller of emc products 
we determined that emc s research and development functions overlap the integration and testing function that we historically performed and  therefore  we decided not to invest further on research and development activities 
we do not expect to incur additional research and development expenses in the future 
restructuring in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced plans to restructure our european operations 
this plan was initiated primarily in order to reduce operating costs and simplify processes throughout the european operations 
the restructuring plan primarily involved the closure of the dublin  ireland facility and the consolidation of european finance functions within the weisbaden  germany facility 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in fiscal for abandoned lease and severance payments related to this restructuring plan 
we recorded a net restructuring benefit of million in fiscal due to higher than anticipated lease payments from sub lessees 
interest and other expense  net interest and other expense  net for fiscal was an expense of million  compared to income of million for fiscal included in interest income for fiscal was approximately million related to the interest portion of our irs refund 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
also contributing to the increased expense was an increase in interest expense due to higher borrowing and higher interest rates on our line of credit during fiscal gain on foreign currency transactions we recorded a gain on foreign currency transactions of million in fiscal compared to a gain of million in fiscal the increased gain was the result of the weakening value of the us dollar as compared to the euro and british pound sterling 
also  in the first quarter of fiscal  we recognized a million loss when we closed out our hedging contracts 
we had no such hedges in place during fiscal income tax expense benefit we recorded tax expense of million in fiscal compared to a net tax benefit of million for fiscal year the net tax benefit was due to a million income tax receivable from the irs due to the settlement on income tax audits for fiscal years through which resulted in a tax payable of million for which we had accrued million and an income tax receivable of million for fiscal years through based upon the carry back of the net operating losses which were confirmed by the irs for the fiscal years through fiscal year compared to fiscal year net product revenue net product revenue for fiscal increased million  or from fiscal this increase was comprised of a million and a million  or and  increase in domestic 
table of contents product and international product revenue  respectively 
the increase in net product revenue was primarily a result of entering into the emc reseller agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal our ability to sell these products enabled us to further penetrate the mid range storage market as evidenced by the addition of new customer accounts during fiscal year also contributing to the increase in net product revenue was the addition of a vice president of us sales  with years of storage experience  responsible for north american sales  and five additional veteran salespersons during fiscal who accounted for million or of total net product revenue in fiscal the increase in net product revenue was driven primarily by strong demand for emc server and software products  which generally have a higher average selling price than our proprietary products 
server and software products increased from fiscal by million and million  respectively  offset by a decrease of million from tape library sales 
the decline in tape library revenue is attributable to a shift in focus towards developing expertise selling the emc product set 
service revenue service revenue was million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal year this decrease was attributable to decreased maintenance revenue of million  offset by increased professional services revenue of million 
subsequent to the end of fiscal year  we became a reseller and service provider of emc automated networked storage systems and software 
commencing with the sale of the emc array of products  most emc hardware products are sold with up to a year x warranty 
as a result  the revenue associated with post warranty service contracts for those hardware product sales will not occur until expiration of the warranty period 
therefore  service revenues decreased from fiscal year to fiscal year another factor that contributed to the decrease in maintenance revenue was the expiration of maintenance contracts without offsetting renewed and new maintenance contracts related to mti branded products 
in order to mitigate these decreases  during fiscal we became a member of the emc authorized services network and are now able to provide end to end service for emc s clariion family of systems 
product gross profit product gross profit was million for fiscal year  an increase of million  or  from fiscal year the gross profit percentage of net product sales was for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year the increase in product gross profit was primarily the result of an increase in product sales  principally emc server and software products  coupled with a million reduction in inventory obsolescence related charges as compared to fiscal year  partially offset by lower standard product margin percentages on a transaction by transaction basis 
also  upon becoming a reseller  we reclassified certain manufacturing department expenses to sg a 
the amount reclassified for fiscal year was million 
no such reclass was made to the fiscal numbers as we were still manufacturing in fiscal service gross profit service gross profit for fiscal year decreased million  or  from fiscal year the gross profit percentage for service revenue was in fiscal year  as compared to for fiscal year we attribute the decreases in service gross profit to reduced field service revenue  particularly maintenance revenue which is supported by a relatively fixed cost structure 
in an effort to improve our service gross profit  the following actions have been taken effective october   we outsourced our domestic customer response center operations to directpointe  inc  a related party  for a minimum monthly charge of million  and in the third quarter of fiscal year  we eliminated eight full time positions in our field service operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased million  or  from fiscal year as noted above  we reclassified million of manufacturing department expenses to sg a upon becoming a reseller 
this reclassification was the primary reason for the increase compared to fiscal also contributing to the increase was an increase of 
table of contents million in salary and benefits expense and a million increase in travel and lodging expense 
these increases were primarily due to increased headcount 
also  during fiscal year  we recovered million from accounts that were previously determined to be uncollectible  as compared to bad debt expense of million in fiscal these increases were partially offset by the following decreases a or million decrease in fixed charges such as depreciation  rent  insurance  property taxes and utilities expenses  a or million decrease in marketing expense  an or million decrease in outside purchases such as consulting and professional services  tax services  bank fees and bad debt expense and an or million decrease in supplies 
the decrease in fixed charges was primarily the current year impact of asset disposals and facilities abandonment in the prior fiscal year 
the decreases in marketing  outside purchases and supplies expenses were the result of a directed program to cut expenses in order to return to profitability 
research and development expenses research and development expenses in fiscal year decreased million  or  from fiscal year these decreases were primarily attributable to decreases in salary and benefit expenses of million resulting from the headcount reductions that occurred primarily during fiscal year and the first quarter of fiscal year  decreases in outside consulting expense of million  decreases in rent  utilities  repair and maintenance  depreciation  insurance and property tax expenses of million and decreases in travel and lodging and supplies expenses of million 
these decreases were the result of our change to our business model from the sale of mti branded products to the sale of co branded solutions serving the storage and enhanced data protection market 
restructuring charges we recorded a net restructuring benefit of million in fiscal this was the result of a reversal of the restructuring reserve in the second quarter of fiscal year of million due to higher than anticipated lease payments from sub lessees and usage of space in our westmont  illinois facilities 
this benefit was partially offset by an additional charge in the first quarter of fiscal year of million due to lower than anticipated lease payments from sub lessees in our sunnyvale  california facility 
other income  net other income  net  which includes interest income and expense  in fiscal year decreased million  or  over fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to the million gain on the sale of a security investment included in fiscal year additional interest expense of million in fiscal year due to higher borrowings on the line of credit also contributed to the decrease 
these decreases were partially offset by million in interest income related to the irs refund recorded in fiscal year gain loss on foreign currency transactions we recorded a million gain on foreign currency transactions during fiscal year  as compared to a million gain in fiscal year during fiscal year  the euro appreciated against the us dollar in approximately the same percentage as compared to fiscal year  however  these foreign currency gains were offset by losses caused by the appreciation of the british pound sterling against the euro 
income taxes we recorded a net tax benefit of million for fiscal year  as compared to a net tax expense of million for fiscal year the net tax benefit is due to a million income tax receivable from the irs due to the settlement on income tax audits for fiscal years through which resulted in a tax payable of million for which we had accrued million and an income tax receivable of million for fiscal years through based upon the carry back of the net operating losses which were confirmed by the irs for the fiscal years through liquidity and capital resources as of april   working capital was million  compared to million as of april  we had cash and cash equivalents of million as of april   compared to million as of april  the million increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily the result of million in net proceeds received from the issuance of series a convertible preferred stock and million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
these increases in cash and cash equivalents were offset by million in cash used in operating activities  mainly due to increased accounts receivable of million 
table of contents and the net loss of million 
the increase in accounts receivable resulted from an increase in sales of in fiscal compared to fiscal coupled with a significant portion of sales occurring during the last month of the quarter 
another significant factor impacting the cash used in operating activities was a million increase in payables 
this increase was mainly the result of increased purchases from emc due to the increase in revenue 
as a reseller  we fulfill our customer orders through purchases from third party vendors  primarily emc 
as such  there is generally a direct correlation between revenue and payables 
in fiscal  cash was also negatively impacted by payments of million for capital expenditures and million on our line of credit 
we expect capital expenditures in fiscal to be comparable to in november  we entered into an agreement with comerica bank for a line of credit of million at an interest rate equal to the prime rate 
the line of credit is secured by a letter of credit that is guaranteed by canopy 
the line of credit with comerica was set to expire on may  and the letter of credit from canopy was to expire on june  however  on june   we renewed the comerica line of credit through may  and canopy renewed its letter of credit guarantee through june  until december   as discussed below  the canopy letter of credit was secured by substantially all the assets of the company 
as of april   there was million outstanding under the comerica loan agreement and million was available for borrowing 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  we executed a letter of credit with comerica bank for million  for the benefit of emc 
this additional letter of credit was incremental to the existing emc credit line of million  thereby extending the purchasing credit limit with emc to million 
this additional letter of credit was secured by a million certificate of deposit at comerica bank 
on december   we entered into a security agreement with emc whereby we granted emc a security interest in certain assets of the company to secure our obligations to emc under our existing supply agreements 
the assets pledged as collateral consist primarily of the company s accounts receivable generated from the sale of emc products and services  related inventory and the proceeds of such accounts receivable and inventory 
in exchange for this security interest  emc increased our purchasing credit limit to million and terminated the million letter of credit noted above 
our payment terms to emc remained at days from shipment 
we had previously granted a security interest in all of our personal property assets to canopy as security for our obligations to canopy in connection with canopy s guaranty of our indebtedness to comerica bank 
to enable us to pledge the collateral described above to emc  canopy delivered a waiver and consent releasing canopy s security interest in the collateral to be pledged to emc and consenting to the transaction 
as part of the waiver and consent  we agreed not to increase our indebtedness to comerica bank above our then current outstanding balance of million  and to make a principal repayment to comerica equal to million on each of february   may  and august  in order to eliminate our outstanding indebtedness to comerica 
we are currently negotiating with canopy the terms of an amendment to this waiver and consent which would terminate our requirement to pay down the outstanding indebtedness to comerica 
both the comerica loan agreement and the emc security agreement contain negative covenants placing restrictions on our ability to engage in any business other than the businesses currently engaged in  suffer or permit a change in control  and merge with or acquire another entity 
we are currently in compliance with all of the terms of the comerica loan agreement and the emc security agreement and believe that we will remain in compliance 
upon an event of default  comerica may terminate the comerica loan agreement and declare all amounts outstanding immediately due and payable 
on june   we sold  shares of series a convertible preferred stock series a in a private placement financing at per share  which raised million in net proceeds 
each share of series a is convertible into common stock at an initial conversion rate of ten shares of common stock for each share of series a  subject to adjustments upon certain dilutive issuance of securities by the company 
the sale included issuance to the investors of warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the shares of common stock into which the warrants are exercisable 
table of contents represent twenty five percent of the aggregate number of shares of common stock into which the series a convertible preferred stock are convertible plus an additional  shares of common stock 
the series a convertible preferred stock carries a cumulative dividend of per year payable when and if declared by the board of directors 
the warrants are exercisable on or after december   and expire on june  the holders of series a are entitled to votes per share on all matters  except the election of directors  where the series a has the right to elect one director to our board 
the series a has certain approval rights as well 
the company s principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and availability under the comerica credit facility 
since the inception of our reseller relationship with emc  we have recorded significant growth in both product revenues and total revenues 
we believe that our current working capital  together with expected cash flows from operations and our comerica credit facility will be adequate to fund operations for at least the next months 
our credit terms with emc are net days from shipment 
our credit terms with our customers generally range from to days 
often there is a gap between when we pay emc and when we ultimately collect the receivable from our customer 
this gap is funded by our working capital 
if we experience a significant deterioration in our receivable collections  or if we are not successful in growing revenues and improving operating margins  we may need to seek additional sources of liquidity to fund operations 
our future is dependent upon many factors  including but not limited to  increasing revenues  improving operating margins  recruiting  hiring  training and retaining significant numbers of qualified personnel  forecasting revenues  controlling expenses and managing assets 
our inability to achieve these objectives could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if we need additional funds such as for acquisition or expansion or to fund a downturn in sales or increase in expenses  there are no assurances that adequate financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
we may in the future seek additional financing from public or private debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance such financing will be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
to the extent any such financing involves the issuance of equity securities  existing stockholders could suffer dilution 
the following represents a comprehensive list of our contractual obligations and commitments as of april  payments due by fiscal period total thereafter in millions line of credit operating lease obligations capital lease obligations inflation and foreign currency exchange we recorded a million foreign exchange gain during fiscal year  which resulted from the weakening us dollar against the euro  partially offset by the appreciation of the british pound sterling against the euro 
in fiscal  approximately of total revenue was generated outside the united states  particularly in germany  france and the united kingdom 
sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar expose us to market risk from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates between the us dollar and the foreign currency  particularly the british pound sterling and the euro 
in fiscal year  we did not enter into forward exchange contracts to sell foreign currency to fix the us dollar amount we will receive on sales denominated in that currency 
historically  in order to minimize the risk of foreign exchange loss  we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts 
however  in order to conserve cash  we ended our hedging program in fiscal year the company has assets and liabilities outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
assets and liabilities outside the united states are primarily located in ireland  germany  france and the united kingdom 
the company s investments in foreign subsidiaries with a 
table of contents functional currency other than the us dollar are generally considered long term 
accordingly  the company does not hedge these net investments

forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially from those discussed in any such statement 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements include the risks described in greater detail in the following paragraphs 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made  and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events 
we are dependent upon emc as the main supplier for our storage solutions  and disruptions in supply or significant increases in costs could harm our business materially 
in march  we entered into a reseller agreement with emc where we became a reseller of emc storage products 
the agreement gives us a right to sell and license emc hardware and software products but also restricts our ability to resell data storage hardware platforms that compete with emc products 
as a result of the agreement  we depend on emc to manufacture and supply us with their storage products 
we may fail to obtain required storage products in a timely manner or to obtain it in the quantities we desire in the future 
if emc were to decide to modify its channel strategy  it may cease supplying us with their storage products 
if emc were to unexpectedly cancel the reseller agreement  we may be unable to find other vendors as a replacement in a timely manner or of acceptable quality 
any interruption or delay in the supply of emc storage products  or the inability to obtain these products at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time  would impair our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could cause customers to cancel orders 
this lost storage product revenue could harm our business  financial condition and operating results rendering us unable to continue operating at our current level of operations 
in the first quarter of fiscal we became an emc premier velocity partner  which has allowed us to earn certain performance based rebates 
in fiscal we recorded performance based rebates of million 
there is no guarantee that we will earn these rebates in the future or that emc will continue to offer such rebate program 
our failure to earn these performance rebates could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we may need additional financing to continue to carry on our existing operations and such additional financing may not be available 
we require substantial working capital to fund our operations 
we have historically used cash generated from our operations  equity capital and bank financings to fund capital expenditures  as well as to invest in and operate our existing operations 
in december   we granted emc a security interest in certain of our assets to secure our obligations to emc  including the obligations under our existing supply agreements with 
table of contents emc 
the assets pledged as collateral consist primarily of our accounts receivable generated from our sale of emc products and services  related inventory and the proceeds of such accounts receivable and inventory 
we had previously granted a security interest in all of our personal property assets to the canopy group  inc  as security for our obligations to canopy in connection with canopy s guaranty of our indebtedness to comerica bank 
to enable us to pledge the collateral described above to emc  canopy delivered to us a waiver and consent releasing canopy s security interest in the collateral to be pledged to emc and consenting to our security agreement with emc 
canopy retained its existing lien on our personal property assets that were not pledged to emc 
as a result of these transactions  the majority of our personal property assets are unavailable as collateral for new borrowings without the consent of emc or canopy 
we believe that our working capital  availability on the comerica line of credit and expected cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
projections for our capital requirements are subject to numerous uncertainties  including the cost savings expected to be realized from the restructuring  the amount of service and product revenue generated in fiscal and general economic conditions 
if we do not realize substantial cost savings from our restructuring  improve revenues and margins  and achieve profitability  we expect to require additional funds in order to carry on our operations  and may seek to raise such funds through bank borrowings or public or private offerings of equity or debt securities or from other sources 
any such activity requires the approval of emc  canopy and the series a investors 
no assurance can be given that emc  canopy or our series a investors will consent to such new financing  that additional financing will be available or that  if available  will be on terms favorable to us 
if additional financing is required but not available to us  we would have to implement additional measures to conserve cash and reduce costs  which may include  among other things  making additional cost reductions 
however  there is no assurance that such measures would be successful 
our failure to raise required additional funds would adversely affect our ability to grow the business  maintain or enhance our product offerings  respond to competitive pressures  and continue operations 
additional funds raised through the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into our common stock may include restrictive covenants and have the following negative effects on the then current holders of our common stock dilution in percentage of ownership in mti  economic dilution if the pricing terms offered to investors are more favorable to them than the current market price  and subordination of the rights  preferences or privileges of common stockholders to the rights  preferences or privileges of new security holders 
the storage market is characterized by rapid technological change  and our success will depend on emc s ability to develop new products 
the market for data storage products is characterized by rapid technology changes 
the market is sensitive to changes in customer demands and very competitive with respect to timely innovation 
new product introductions representing new or improved technology or industry standards may cause our existing products to become obsolete 
when we became a reseller of emc disk based storage products  we agreed not to sell data storage hardware platforms that compete with emc products 
emc s ability to introduce new or enhanced products into the market on a timely basis at competitive price levels will affect our future results 

table of contents the markets for the products and services that we sell are intensely competitive  which may lead to reduced sales of our products  reduced profits and reduced market share for our business 
the market for our products and services is intensely competitive 
if we fail to maintain or enhance our competitive position  we could experience pricing pressures and reduced sales  margins  profits and market share  each of which could materially harm our business 
furthermore  new products and technologies developed by third parties may depress the sales of existing products and technologies 
our customers requirements and the technology available to satisfy those requirements are continually changing 
we must be able to respond to these changes in order to remain competitive 
since we emphasize integrating third party products  our ability to respond to new technologies will be substantially dependent upon our contractual relationships with the third parties whose products we sell  particularly emc 
in addition  we must be able to quickly and effectively train our employees with respect to any new products or technologies developed by our third party suppliers and resold by us 
since we are not exclusive resellers  the third party products we sell are available from a large number of sources 
therefore  we must distinguish ourselves by the quality of our service and support 
the principal elements of competition in our markets include quality of professional services consulting and support  responsiveness to customer and market needs  product price  quality  reliability and performance  and ability to sell  service and deploy new technology 
we have a number of competitors in various markets  including hewlett packard  sun microsystems  ibm  hitachi and network appliance  each of which has substantially greater name recognition  marketing capabilities  and financial  technological  and personnel resources than mti 
certain of our sales transactions are generated through sales leads received from emc 
although emc s primary sales focus is currently on large enterprise customers  should emc change its strategy and begin to sell directly to the small to mid enterprise customers  or work more closely with other resellers  it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
our stock ownership is concentrated in a few stockholders who may be able to influence corporate decisions 
our stock ownership is concentrated in a few stockholders who may be able to influence corporate decisions 
as a result of this  these few stockholders may be able to influence actions of the company that require stockholder approval  in particular with regard to significant corporate transactions 
among other things  this may delay or prevent a change in control of the company that may be favored by other stockholders  and may in general make it difficult for the company to effect certain actions without the support of the larger stockholders 
through december   ralph j 
yarro iii  one of our directors  was a director  president and chief executive officer of canopy 
also through december   darcy g 
mott  one of our directors  was vice president  treasurer and chief financial officer of canopy 
effective march   mr 
yarro and mr 
mott resigned from their positions as directors of the company 
subsequent to fiscal year  we appointed mr 
william mustard to the board of directors of the company 
mr 
mustard replaced mr 
yarro as president and ceo of canopy 
as of april   canopy beneficially owned of the company s common stock 
in addition  the holders of our series a preferred stock  as a result of their acquisition of securities issued in our june private placement  beneficially own approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
other than election of directors  the holders of series a generally have the right to vote on any matter with the holders of common stock  and each share of series a is entitled to votes 
the 
table of contents approval of the holders of a majority of the series a  voting as a class  will be required to approve certain corporate actions  including any amendment of the company s charter or by laws that adversely affects the holders of series a  any authorization of a class of capital stock ranking senior to  or on parity with  the series a  any increase in the size of the company s board of directors to greater than eight members or any change in the classification of the board of directors  certain redemptions or repurchases of capital stock acquisitions of capital stock or assets from other entities  effecting  or entering into any agreement to effect  any merger  consolidation  recapitalization  reorganization  liquidation  dissolution  winding up or similar transaction a liquidation event involving the company or any of its subsidiaries  any sale of assets of the company or a subsidiary which is outside the ordinary course of business  any purchase of assets of or an equity interest in another entity for more than million  and any incurrence of additional debt for borrowed money in excess of million 
the holders of series a  exclusively and as a single class  are entitled to elect one member of the company s board of directors 
in connection with the series a financing  the series a investors  the company and the canopy group  inc entered into a voting agreement  pursuant to which  when any matter involving a significant corporation transaction such as a merger  consolidation  liquidation  significant issuance of voting securities by the company  sale of significant company assets  or acquisition of significant assets or equity interest of another entity is submitted to a vote of the company s stockholders  canopy has agreed that either a the common stock of the company that canopy holds will be voted in proportion to the series a investors votes on the matter  or b if canopy wishes that any of its common stock be voted differently than in proportion to the series a investors votes  canopy will  if so required by a series a investor  purchase from the series a investor s with which the canopy votes are not aligned all or any portion as required by the series a investor of such investor s series a convertible preferred stock 
the per share price in any such purchase is to equal two times the sum of x the stated value of a share of series a convertible preferred stock plus y any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon 
at any stockholder meeting at which members of the board are to be elected and the series a investors do not then have either a series a director on the board or the power at such election to elect a series a director to the board  canopy has agreed to vote in favor of one nominee of the advent funds and the series a investors have agreed to vote in favor of a canopy nominee 
currently  canopy beneficially owns approximately of the company s outstanding common stock calculated assuming conversion of all outstanding series a preferred  but excluding outstanding options and warrants 
our future operating results may depend on the success of our cost reduction initiatives 
in fiscal year  we implemented restructuring activities in an effort to reduce costs 
in fiscal year  we implemented additional restructuring activities related to the closure of the dublin  ireland facility 
these measures included reductions in our workforce and the partial or complete closure of certain under utilized facilities  including offices 
we cannot predict with any certainty the long term impact of our workforce reductions 
reductions in our workforce could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations by  among other things  making it difficult to motivate and retain the remaining employees  which in turn may affect our ability to deliver our products in a timely fashion 
we also cannot assure you that these measures will be successful in achieving the expected benefits within the expected time frames  or at all  or that the workforce reductions will not impair our ability to achieve our current or future business objectives 

table of contents we are party to long term  non cancelable facility leases for facilities which we do not use and may not be able to sublease on terms that will offset our lease obligations  which may result in a continuing unfavorable impact on our cash position 
we are party to long term  non cancelable facility leases with respect to facilities we no longer utilize and which are located in geographic regions that have undergone a significant decrease in real property values 
for example  we no longer utilize our facilities in sunnyvale  california  westmont  illinois  raleigh  north carolina and various facilities in europe 
as a result  we are obligated to continue making lease payments related to our unutilized facilities 
in the aggregate  in fiscal year  and  we are obligated to pay gross lease payments of approximately million  million and million  respectively  for facility space which we no longer utilize  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to sublease the unutilized facilities on terms that will significantly offset these obligations 
a significant portion of our revenues occurs in the last month of a given quarter 
consequently  our results of operations for any particular quarter are difficult to predict 
we have experienced  historically  a significant portion of our orders  sales and shipments in the last month or weeks of each quarter 
in fiscal year    and  respectively  of our total revenue was recorded in the last month of each successive quarter 
we expect this pattern to continue  and possibly to increase  in the future 
this uneven pattern makes our ability to forecast revenues  earnings and working capital requirements for each quarter difficult and uncertain 
if we do not receive orders that we have anticipated or complete shipments within a given quarter  our results of operations could be harmed materially for that quarter 
additionally  due to receiving a significant portion of our orders in the last month of the quarter  we may experience a situation in which we have exceeded our credit limits with our vendors thereby making our ability to ship to our customers very difficult 
if we experience such situations and are unable to extend our credit limits with our vendors  this could materially harm our results of operations 
our quarterly results may fluctuate from period to period 
therefore  historical results may not be indicative of future results or be helpful in evaluating the results of our business 
we have experienced quarterly fluctuations in operating results and we anticipate that these fluctuations may continue into the future 
these fluctuations have resulted from  and may continue to be caused by  a number of factors  including the size  timing and terms of customer orders  the introduction of new products by our competitors and competitive pricing pressures  the timing of the introduction of new products and new versions of best of breed products  shifts in our product or services mix  changes in our operating expenditures  and decreases in our gross profit as a percentage of revenues for mature products 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indications of our future performance 
we cannot assure you that we will be profitable on a quarter to quarter basis or that our future revenues and operating results will meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
failure to be profitable on a quarterly basis or to meet such expectations could cause a significant decrease in the trading 
table of contents price of our common stock 
the table below quantifies the fluctuations in our period to period results in fiscal year amounts in thousands total gross operating revenue profit loss net loss fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter total our solutions are complex and may contain undetected software or hardware errors that could be difficult  costly  and time consuming to repair 
although we have not experienced significant undetected software or hardware errors to date  given the complex nature of our solutions  we believe the risk of undetected software or hardware errors may occur in networking products primarily when they are first introduced or as new versions of products are released 
these errors  if significant  could adversely affect our sales  cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  cause significant customer relations problems  harm our competitive position  hurt our reputation  and cause purchase delays 
any of these effects could materially harm our business or results of operations 
all domestic employment at mti  including employment of our domestic key personnel  is at will 
both the company and its us employees have the right to terminate employment at any time  with or without advance notice  and with or without cause 
we believe that our success is dependent  to a significant extent  upon the efforts and abilities of our salespeople  technical staff and senior management team  particularly our executive officers  who have been instrumental in setting our strategic plans 
the loss of the services of our key personnel  especially to our competitors  could materially harm our business 
the failure to retain key personnel  or to implement a succession plan to prepare qualified individuals to join us upon the loss of a member of our key personnel  could materially harm our business 
we are subject to financial and operating risks associated with international sales and services 
international sales and services represented approximately of our total sales and service revenue for fiscal year prior to fiscal year  international sales and service also represented a significant portion of total revenue 
as a result  our results of operations are subject to the financial and operating risks of conducting business internationally  including changes in a country s economic or political conditions  greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection and longer payment cycles  fluctuating exchange rates  tariffs and other barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations  unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  import or export restrictions  potentially adverse tax consequences  
table of contents potential hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  and differing customer and or technology standards requirements 
all of our sales and services in international markets are priced in the applicable local currencies and are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts on a limited basis in an attempt to minimize foreign currency exposure 
such contracts can be costly or limited in their effectiveness 
if we are faced with significant changes in the regulatory and business climate in our international markets  our business and results of operations could suffer 
we may have difficulty managing any future growth effectively 
during fiscal year as part of the restructuring plan  we completely ceased manufacturing our legacy products  resulting in workforce reductions of manufacturing  r d and sales positions and the partial and complete closures of under utilized facilities 
at the same time  we made a strategic shift from manufacturing our products to reselling emc products when we entered into the reseller agreement with emc on march  historically  we have not experienced difficulty managing growth 
however  as a result of the restructuring plan and our transition to becoming a reseller  our facilities  personnel  operating and financial systems may not be sufficient to effectively manage our expected future growth and  as a result  we may lose our ability to respond to new opportunities promptly 
additionally  our expected revenue growth may not materialize and increases in our operating expenses in response to the expected revenue growth may harm our operating results and financial condition 
our growth is currently focused on increasing emc product sales and providing a broad range of professional services 
to accomplish these goals  we are dependent upon many factors  including but not limited to  recruiting  hiring  training and retaining significant numbers of qualified sales and professional services personnel in various geographic regions 
we may face inherent costly damages or litigation costs if third parties claim that the products we sell infringe upon their intellectual property rights 
although we have not experienced material costs with respect to proprietary rights infringement cases  there is risk that our business activities may infringe upon the proprietary rights of others  and other parties may assert infringement claims against us 
though the majority of our future product sales are expected to be third party products  and the applicable third party manufacturers will defend their own intellectual property rights  in the event such claims are made against our suppliers  we may be faced with a situation in which we cannot sell the products and thus our results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected 
in addition  we may receive communications from other parties asserting that our own intellectual property infringes on their proprietary rights 
if we become liable to any third party for infringing its intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay substantial damage awards and to develop non infringing technology  obtain licenses  or to cease selling the applications that contain the infringing intellectual property 
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties  and any outcome unfavorable to us could materially harm our business 
furthermore  we could incur substantial costs in defending against any intellectual property litigation  and these costs could increase significantly if any dispute were to go to trial 
our defense of any litigation  regardless of the merits of the complaint  likely would be time consuming  costly  and a distraction to our management personnel 
adverse publicity related to any intellectual property litigation also could harm the sale of our products and damage our competitive position 
if we and or our partners are unable to comply with evolving industry standards and government regulations  we may be unable either to sell our solutions or to be competitive in the marketplace 
our solutions must comply with current industry standards and government regulations in the us and internationally 
any new products and product enhancements that we sell in the future also must meet industry standards and government regulations at the time they are introduced 
failure to comply with existing 
table of contents or evolving industry standards or to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals could materially harm our business 
in addition  such compliance may be time consuming and costly 
our solutions integrate san  nas  das and cas technologies into a single storage architecture 
components of these architectures must comply with evolving industry standards  and we depend upon our suppliers to provide us with products that meet these standards 
if our suppliers or customers do not support the same industry standards that we do  or if competing standards emerge that we do not support  market acceptance of our products could suffer 
our stock price may be volatile  which could lead to losses by investors and to securities litigation 
the value of an investment in our company could decline due to the impact of any of the following factors upon the market price of our common stock the timing and announcement of new products or services by us  our partners or by our competitors  failure of our results from operations to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  speculation in the press or investment community about our business or our competitive position  the volume of trading in our common stock  and market conditions and the trading price of shares of technology companies generally 
in addition  stock markets  particularly the nasdaq smallcap market  where our shares are listed  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  and the market prices of securities of companies such as ours have been highly volatile 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
fluctuations such as these may affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and could divert our management s attention and resources 
our stockholders may be diluted by the conversion of outstanding series a convertible preferred stock and the exercise of warrants to purchase common stock issued in our june private placement 
there are currently  shares of our series a convertible preferred stock outstanding  which are held by the selling stockholders and which are convertible at any time into an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
dividends accrue on the series a convertible preferred stock at an annual rate of  and the holders of series a convertible preferred stock may convert the accrued dividends into shares of common stock to the extent the company has not previously paid such dividends in cash 
the holders of series a are also entitled to antidilution protection  pursuant to which the conversion price would be reduced using a weighted average calculation in the event the company issues certain additional securities at a price per share less than the conversion price then in effect 
in addition  the holders of series a have preemptive rights to purchase a pro rata portion of certain future issuances of equity securities by the company 
there are currently warrants outstanding to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  which are held by the series a investors 
the exercise price for such warrants is per share 
the warrants became exercisable on december  if the selling stockholders convert series a or exercise the warrants they hold  the company would be required to issue additional shares of common stock  resulting in dilution of existing common stockholders and potentially a decline in the market price of our common stock 
failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
we are in the process of documenting and testing our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act  which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors regarding our assessments 
during the course of our testing we may identify deficiencies which we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the sarbanes oxley act for compliance with the requirements of section in addition  if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such 
table of contents standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
we may fail to comply with nasdaq marketplace rules 
our securities have been trading on the nasdaq smallcap market since august  we are currently in compliance with nasdaq smallcap market continued listing requirements 
however  we failed to comply with nasdaq marketplace rules particularly with the minimum bid price requirement in fiscal year  and may once again fail to comply with the minimum bid price requirement  or other continued listing requirements of the nasdaq smallcap market 
if that happens and we do not regain compliance by the end of the applicable grace period  our stock will be delisted and we would likely seek listing of our common stock on the over the counter market  which is viewed by many investors as a less liquid marketplace 
as a result  the price per share of our common stock would likely decrease materially and the trading market for our common stock  our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to secure additional financing would likely be materially and adversely affected 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could affect the price of our common stock 
our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain various provisions  including notice provisions and provisions authorizing us to issue preferred stock  that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or may discourage acquisition bids for  our company 
also  the rights of holders of our common stock may be affected adversely by the rights of holders of our series a convertible preferred stock and any other preferred stock that we may issue in the future that would be senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock 
furthermore  we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law regulating corporate takeovers 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our european operations transact in foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the british pound sterling and the euro 
in the prior year  in order to minimize the risk of foreign exchange loss  we entered into foreign currency forward contracts 
however  in order to conserve cash  we ended our hedging program in may our exposure to short term interest rate fluctuations is limited to our short term borrowings under our line of credit 
our line of credit allows borrowings up to million and therefore a increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by million if the line of credit were fully utilized
