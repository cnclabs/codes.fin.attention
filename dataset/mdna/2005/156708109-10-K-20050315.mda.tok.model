item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to provide information to assist you in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
we recommend that you read this md a in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
executive summary cephalon is an international biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery  development and marketing of innovative products to treat sleep disorders  neurological disorders  cancer and pain 
in addition to conducting an active research and development program  we market three products in the united states and numerous products in various countries throughout europe 
through our wholly owned subsidiary  cima labs inc  we develop and manufacture orally disintegrating tablets using proprietary technologies 
our three largest products in terms of product sales  provigil  actiq and gabitril  comprised approximately of our worldwide net sales for the year ended december  we market provigil  actiq and gabitril in the united states through our approximately person sales force 
our corporate headquarters are in frazer  pennsylvania  and our research and development headquarters are in west chester  pennsylvania 
in addition  we have offices in utah  minnesota  france  the united kingdom  germany and switzerland 
we operate manufacturing facilities in france for the production of modafinil  which is the active drug substance in provigil  utah  for the production of actiq for worldwide distribution and sale  and minnesota  for the production of orally disintegrating versions of drugs for our partners 
our future success is highly dependent on obtaining and maintaining patent protection for our products and technology 
with respect to provigil  we have filed patent infringement lawsuits against six generic companies based upon the andas filed by these companies seeking fda approval to market a generic version of modafinil 
we anticipate that the first trial will begin no earlier than late see certain risks related to our business 
for actiq  the patents covering the previous and current formulations of the product are set to expire as early as may and september  respectively 
as a result of the license and supply agreement we entered into with barr laboratories  inc in july  we could face generic competition from barr prior to september if we receive fda approval of oravescent fentanyl before this date 
see acquisition of cima labs inc 
below 
in december  we announced that fda had acknowledged receipt of an anda filed by barr seeking approval for a generic form of actiq 
in january  we filed a patent infringement lawsuit against barr to defend our patents until the license effective date 
neither the anda filing nor the lawsuit modify the existing license grant to barr  and we do not expect any change in the anticipated date of barr s entry to market absent resolution of the lawsuit 
the loss of patent protection on any of our existing us products  whether by third party challenge  invalidation  circumvention  license or patent expiration  would materially impact our results of operations 
as part of our business strategy  in the future we expect to consider and  as appropriate  consummate acquisitions of other technologies  products and businesses 
over the past few years  we also have pursued a strategy of both broadening the range of clinical uses that are approved by regulatory authorities and seeking new and improved formulations of our currently marketed products 
during  we made significant progress towards these goals 
some notable achievements include we received final approval from the us food and drug administration to expand the label for provigil to include improving wakefulness in patients with excessive sleepiness associated with swsd and in patients with osa hs  we submitted an snda to the fda seeking marketing approval of attenace  a new proprietary once daily dosage form of modafinil for the treatment of adhd in children and adolescents between the ages of six and we are targeting launch of attenace by early  we recently reported positive phase clinical trial results with nuvigil in narcolepsy  osa hs and swsd and expect to submit an nda for nuvigil to the fda in march  we initiated a phase clinical program evaluating gabitril for the treatment of gad and  if the results of these studies are positive  expect to submit an nda to the fda in early  we submitted to the fda an snda seeking regulatory approval of a sugar free formulation of actiq and anticipate approval by mid  and through our acquisition of cima labs  we acquired the oravescent fentanyl product candidate 
oravescent fentanyl is in phase clinical trials for the treatment of breakthrough cancer pain in opioid tolerant patients  and we are targeting submission of an nda to the fda later this year and approval of this product by the fda in late we also have significant research programs focused on developing therapeutics to treat neurological and oncological disorders 
in the neurology area  we have a program with h 
lundbeck a s to evaluate a molecule  cep  in an patient phase clinical trial for the treatment of patients with early stage parkinson s disease 
in the cancer area  we have a program with a molecule  cep  and are currently conducting phase clinical trials in patients suffering from aml 
we also are conducting a phase program with another molecule  cep  to evaluate safety and tolerability and to gather preliminary evidence of efficacy in patients with treatment refractory tumors 
in the pharmaceutical industry  the regulatory approval for the sale of new pharmaceutical products remains highly uncertain because the majority of therapeutic candidates fail to show the human safety and efficacy necessary for regulatory approval and successful commercialization 
in addition  these efforts require substantial time  effort and financial resources 
our success in developing and commercializing these product candidates  or new or improved formulations of existing products  will be a significant factor in our future success 
we have significant levels of indebtedness outstanding  nearly all of which consists of convertible notes with stated conversion prices or restricted conversion prices higher than our stock price as of the date of this filing 
of our outstanding convertible notes  as of the filing date of this report  million in aggregate principal amount outstanding matures in december the rate of our future growth and our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service and repay our indebtedness ultimately will depend  in large part  on our ability to maintain patent protection on our existing products and successfully acquire or develop new products and new indications for our existing products 
acquisition of cima labs inc 
on august   we completed our acquisition of cima labs inc 
under the agreement and plan of merger dated november   we acquired each outstanding share of cima labs common stock for per share in cash 
the total cash paid to cima labs stockholders in the transaction was approximately million  net of cima labs existing cash on hand  or million  net of its cash  cash equivalents and investments 
as a result of the acquisition  we obtained the rights to cima labs oravescent fentanyl product candidate  which is currently in phase clinical trials for the treatment of breakthrough cancer pain in opioid tolerant patients 
oravescent fentanyl utilizes an enhanced absorption transmucosal drug delivery technology that we believe may facilitate the rapid onset of pain relief in such patients 
we are targeting approval of this product by the fda in late cima labs also develops and manufactures orally disintegrating tablets using its proprietary technologies  orasolv and durasolv  that allow an active drug ingredient to be formulated into a new dosage form that quickly disintegrates in the mouth without chewing or the need for water 
cima labs enters into collaborative agreements with pharmaceutical companies to develop products based on its oral drug delivery technologies 
it currently manufactures for its partners  including astrazeneca  nv organon and wyeth  five prescriptions and three over the counter pharmaceutical brands incorporating either the orasolv or durasolv technologies 
revenues from these arrangements consist of net sales of manufactured product to partners  product development and licensing fees and royalties 
for the period august  to december   revenues attributable to cima labs totaled million 
cima labs has facilities in eden prairie and brooklyn park  minnesota  which house its executive offices  manufacturing facility  research and product development center and warehouse space 
to secure ftc clearance of the cima labs acquisition  we entered into a license and supply agreement with barr whereby we agreed to license to barr our us rights to any intellectual property related to actiq 
the license to actiq will become effective upon the earliest to occur of i final fda approval of oravescent fentanyl  ii september   if we have not received either a an approvable letter from fda for the sugar free formulation of actiq by july  or final fda approval within days of such approvable letter or b a pediatric extension for actiq or iii february   if we have received a pediatric extension for actiq 
as we currently expect to receive both a pediatric extension for actiq prior to september and fda approval for the sugar free formulation of actiq within the timeframe agreed upon with the ftc  we anticipate that the barr license will be effective upon oravescent fentanyl approval 
under the agreement  barr also may receive a license to the sugar free formulation of actiq under development  this license would become effective upon oravescent fentanyl approval by the fda or if the sugar free approval timelines described above are not achieved 
we have filed an snda with the fda requesting approval for the sugar free formulation of actiq  and we anticipate final fda approval of this formulation by mid under the license and supply agreement  we also agreed to transfer to barr our technological know how and intellectual property related to actiq and to sell to barr  for period of up to three years  a generic form of actiq for resale in the united states if barr is unable to manufacture an fda approved generic version of actiq by the date the license takes effect 
in addition  we have agreed to forbear from asserting any remaining patent rights in actiq against other parties beginning on the earlier of august  or six months following the effective date of barr s license 
results of operations dollar amounts in thousands sales in the united states  we sell our products to pharmaceutical wholesalers  the largest three of which accounted for of our worldwide net sales for the year ended december  decisions made by these wholesalers and their customers regarding the levels of inventory they hold and thus the amount of product they purchase from us are outside of our control and can materially affect the level of our sales in any particular period and thus may not necessarily correlate to the number of prescriptions written for our products as reported by ims health incorporated 
to the extent possible  we attempt to minimize these fluctuations  both by providing  from time to time  discounts to our customers to stock normal amounts of inventory and by canceling orders if we believe a particular customer is speculatively buying inventory in anticipation of possible price increases 
however  we do not have any agreements  understandings or business practices under which we extend incentives based on levels of inventory held by wholesalers 
as of december   we received information from our three largest us wholesaler customers about the levels of inventory they held for our three products 
based on this information  which we have not independently verified  we believe that inventory held at these wholesalers is within a normal range for our business of approximately one month s supply 
however  we currently do not have ongoing agreements for access to the actual inventory levels of our products held by our wholesalers or their customers 
at the beginning of  we consolidated our two former us sales forces into a single unit that now details all three products to a broader group of physicians  including primary care physicians eg internists  general practitioners and family practitioners 
in addition  we expanded this combined force to approximately persons 
we believe this substantially larger sales force  coupled with focused marketing efforts designed to educate physicians and communicate the benefits of our products  contributed to the increases in total sales for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december  change change sales provigil    actiq    gabitril    other    total sales    total other revenues total revenues    sales in addition to our larger sales force presence and targeted sales and marketing efforts designed to educate physicians and communicated the benefits of our products  other factors which contributed to the increase in sales are summarized as follows an expanded us label for provigil received from the fda in early was a key factor in contributing to the year over year increase in provigil sales 
us prescriptions for provigil increased by  according to ims health 
the period to period change was also impacted by lower sales recorded in the first quarter of as a result of the depletion of inventory levels at certain wholesalers 
additionally  domestic price increases of approximately period over period contributed to higher sales 
sales of actiq increased as compared to last year 
us prescriptions for actiq increased by  according to ims health 
in addition  domestic prices increased approximately from period to period 
sales of gabitril increased as compared to last year 
us prescriptions for gabitril increased by  according to ims health 
an increase in domestic prices of approximately period over period also contributed to higher sales recorded in other sales consist of sales of other products and certain third party products in various international markets  principally in france and sales of products manufactured by cima labs and sold to its pharmaceutical partners 
the most significant products in this other sales category are spasfon phloroglucinol with total sales of million and fonzylane buflomedil with total sales of million  both of which are sold by cephalon france 
analysis of gross sales to net sales the following table presents the adjustments deducted from gross sales to arrive at a net sales figure for the year ended december  change change gross sales    adjustments to gross sales prompt payment discounts    returns    coupons    medicaid discounts    managed care and governmental agreements    net sales adjustments to gross sales as a percentage of gross sales increases in the dollar amount of adjustments to gross sales from to primarily reflect increases in gross sales during the period and corresponding increases in discounts  expected returns and coupon usage  and participation in managed care  medicaid  and other governmental programs 
the change in the adjustments to gross sales as a percentage of gross sales is primarily driven by higher medicaid discounts  and managed care and governmental agreement discounts and chargebacks resulting from the impact of price increases and increased participation 
other revenues the increase in other revenues of from period to period is primarily due to the inclusion of product development and licensing fees and royalties of million attributable to cima labs partially offset by a decrease in partner reimbursements on both our cep program and our cep program and a reduction in earnings recognized under our collaboration agreement with novartis pharma ag 
the level of other revenue recognized from period to period may continue to fluctuate based on the status and activity of each related project and terms of each collaboration agreement 
therefore  past levels of other revenues may not be indicative of future levels 
for the year ended december  change change costs and expenses cost of sales    research and development    selling  general and administrative    depreciation and amortization    impairment charge   acquired in progress research and development costs  certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the presentation for the year ended december  in our result of operations for the year ended december   million of expenditures were reclassified from the research and development category into the selling  general and administrative category 
cost of sales the cost of sales was approximately of net sales in and of net sales in the decrease is primarily due to cost savings realized from our transfer of us actiq manufacturing from abbott laboratories to our salt lake city facility beginning in june  partially offset by higher costs related to other products sold in france and to cima labs cost of sales for which there are no comparable data for and for which the margin is higher than other cephalon products 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million  or  in as compared to of this increase  million is due to clinical research costs including expenditures associated with increased headcount necessary to support higher levels of clinical activities and expenditures associated with additional clinical studies initiated in to explore the utility of gabitril beyond its current indication  costs incurred with phase clinical programs for attenace which began in late  and costs incurred with our phase studies of nuvigil which began in the fourth quarter of the increase in also was impacted by higher costs incurred during associated with supplying materials for our clinical trials in process  developing new or improved production processes for our currently marketed products and products in development  and by the inclusion of cima labs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in as compared to the increase is predominantly the result of the expansion of our european and us field sales forces  additional product promotional expenses and an increased number of educational programs 
in addition  a portion of the increase is due to higher administrative expenses associated with an increase in headcount  costs associated with complying with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  and higher accruals for bonus expenses resulting from a shift away from a stock option based incentive compensation plan to a cash based incentive compensation plan 
these increases were partially offset by the recognition of a gain of million in as a result of retiree medical benefit changes for current employees at cephalon france 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million  or  in as compared to depreciation expense increased period over period primarily as a result of increased capital investments in software  building and laboratory improvements at our west chester location  increased spending on manufacturing equipment at our salt lake city location and the acquisition of property  plant and equipment associated with the cima labs acquisition 
amortization expense increased due to the amortization of technology  trademark and marketing rights acquired from cima labs 
impairment charge during  we recorded an impairment charge of million for the write off of our investment in mds proteomics inc acquired in process research and development in connection with our acquisition of cima labs  we allocated approximately million of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
at the acquisition date  cima labs ongoing research and development initiatives were focused on the development and commencement of phase clinical trials of oravescent fentanyl  and several other minor ongoing research and development projects 
these costs were charged to expense in the third quarter of since  at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses

interest expense decreased by million due primarily to a decrease in interest and amortization expense resulting from the repurchases and redemptions of a portion of our convertible subordinated notes during and partially offset by an increase in amortization expense associated with debt issuance costs from the june sales of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes 
in july  a holder of our convertible subordinated notes approached us  and we agreed  to exchange million of these outstanding notes into  shares of our common stock 
we recognized debt exchange expense of million in the third quarter of relating to this exchange in accordance with sfas no 
 induced conversion of convertible debt 
in march and august  we repurchased for cash million at a price of of the face amount and million at a price of of the face amount  respectively  of the convertible subordinated notes in private transactions 
as a result  during  we recognized million in our financial statements as a charge on early extinguishment of debt 
in july  we redeemed for cash all of the million outstanding notes at a redemption price of per  aggregate principal amount of notes and we purchased million of the notes from one of the holders in a private transaction at a price of of the face amount of the notes 
as a result  during  million was recognized in our financial statements as a charge on early extinguishment of debt 
other income decreased by million in primarily due to a million gain on the increase in the fair value of a foreign currency derivative instrument in and losses on the disposal of fixed assets related to the renovation of our facilities in for the year ended december  change change income tax expense   income taxes during  we recognized million of income tax expense on a loss before income taxes of million  generating an overall effective tax rate of 
this compared to tax expense of million on income before income taxes of million  yielding an effective tax rate of 
the change in effective tax rates between and is primarily due to the million acquired in process research and development charge that was not tax deductible and  therefore  no tax benefit was recorded for this item 
in addition  we recorded a decrease in the valuation allowance account of million and recognized a research and development tax credit of million  both of which were partially offset by alternative minimum tax expense

while applicable laws and regulations prevent us from promoting our products for uses beyond those contained in the approved label  our analysis of prescription data for provigil in the united states indicated a considerable portion of the increase in prescriptions is due to the fact that some physicians have elected to prescribe the product to treat excessive sleepiness and fatigue outside of narcolepsy 
sales in also increased relative to as a result of the depletion in and early of inventory levels at certain wholesalers 
additionally  international sales of provigil increased during due to the impact of recording a full calendar year of sales in in certain european countries to which product rights had been acquired in  and also due to the favorable translation impact resulting from a strengthening euro and uk pound versus the uk dollar 
sales of actiq increased in as compared to the same period last year 
this increase was due  in part  to an expansion of our sales force in and continued  focused marketing efforts to pain specialists as indicated by an increase in us prescriptions  according to ims health

while applicable laws and regulations prevent us from promoting our products for uses beyond those contained in the approved label  our analysis of prescription data for gabitril in the united states indicated a considerable portion of the increase in prescriptions is due to the fact that some physicians have elected to explore new uses for gabitril including anxiety  insomnia  and neuropathic pain 
weighted average increases in domestic prices of approximately also contributed to higher sales recorded in other sales consist primarily of sales of other products and certain third party products in various international markets  principally in france 
the most significant sales in this category are spasfon phloroglucinol and fonzylane buflomedil 
while other sales denominated in foreign currencies remained relatively flat from year to year  a strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar in contributed to increased equivalent sales denominated in us dollars

cost of sales the cost of sales was approximately of net sales for and of net sales for the decrease is due to cost savings realized from our transfer of us actiq manufacturing from abbott laboratories to our salt lake city facility beginning in june and to higher than normal gabitril inventory costs recorded in associated with our acquisition of gabitril product rights in territories other than the united states 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million  or  in as compared to approximately million of this increase is due to costs associated with additional clinical studies conducted in to explore the utility of gabitril beyond its current indication  increased expenditures associated with the ongoing phase study of cep in parkinson s disease  and costs incurred with phase and phase studies of nuvigil 
research and development expenses incurred by our cephalon france subsidiary increased million primarily as a result of the strengthening of the euro as compared to the us dollar 
additionally  in  we recorded a million charge relating to the write off as r d expense of the value of an investment in an unaffiliated entity 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in expenditures in primarily associated with the conclusion of clinical studies of provigil in shift work sleep disorder and adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder of million and by a decrease in expenditures of million related predominantly to producing clinical supplies in for our phase studies of cep in collaboration with sanofi synth labo

this benefit was partially offset by income tax expense primarily associated with group lafon 
in light of our expectations for continued profitability  during the fourth quarter of  we concluded that it was probable that we would realize a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the benefit of accumulated international  federal and state net operating losses  and federal research and development credits 
we reduced the valuation allowance against certain of these deferred tax assets accordingly 
in  the valuation allowance increased in total by million 
the increase is primarily attributable to an increase of million for state net operating losses that we believe are unlikely to be realized in the future  partially offset by a decrease in the valuation allowances for federal r d credits that we now expect will be realized due to our increasing profits 
cumulative effect of changing inventory costing method from fifo to lifo effective january   we changed our method of valuing domestic inventories from the first in  first out  or fifo method  to the last in  first out  or lifo method

commitments and contingencies legal proceedings for a complete description of legal proceedings  see part i  item  legal proceedings 
cephalon clinical partners  lp in august  we exclusively licensed our rights to myotrophin for human therapeutic use within the united states  canada and europe to cephalon clinical partners  lp ccp 
a subsidiary of cephalon is the sole general partner of ccp 
we developed myotrophin on behalf of ccp under a research and development agreement 
under this agreement  ccp granted an exclusive license to us to manufacture and market myotrophin for human therapeutic use within the united states  canada and europe  and we agreed to make royalty payments equal to a percentage of product sales and a milestone payment of approximately million upon regulatory approval 
we have a contractual option  but not an obligation  to purchase all of the limited partnership interests of ccp  which is exercisable upon the occurrence of certain events following the first commercial sale of myotrophin 
if  and only if  we decide to exercise this purchase option  we would make an advance payment of approximately million in cash or  at our election  approximately million in shares of common stock or a combination thereof 
if we discontinue development of myotrophin  or if we do not exercise this purchase option  our license will terminate and all rights to manufacture or market myotrophin in the united states  canada and europe will revert to ccp  which may then commercialize myotrophin itself or license or assign its rights to a third party 
in that event  we would not receive any benefits from such commercialization  license or assignment of rights 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
subsequently  in december  the fasb issued a revised version of fin fin r 
fin and fin r require a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin and fin r also require disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of fin and fin r apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to existing special purpose entities in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after december  for all other entities  the requirements of fin and fin r apply in the first period ending after march  as a result of the adoption of the standards  ccp has been consolidated in our financial statements at december  and this consolidation did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
other commitments and contingencies the following table summarizes our obligations to make future payments under current contracts in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years debt obligations      convertible notes     capital lease obligations    interest payments on debt    operating leases      total contractual cash obligations    the convertible notes in the table include million and million of zero coupon convertible notes that are due in years and more than years  respectively 
this classification is based on the date that such notes are first putable to us by holders 
these notes also contain restrictions on a holder s ability to convert such notes into a mixture of cash and stock 
if these restrictions on conversion are satisfied  we would classify the then aggregate outstanding principal balance of such notes as a current liability on our balance sheet 
as of december   these restrictions have not been met 
in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of our in licensing and development programs primarily in the area of research and development agreements 
payments generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  we have not recorded a liability on our balance sheet for any such contingencies 
as of december   the potential milestone and other contingency payments due under current contractual agreements are approximately million 
outlook overview cash  cash equivalents and investments at december  were million 
in august  we completed our acquisition of cima labs and paid million in cash  net of cima labs existing cash on hand  or million  net of its cash  cash equivalents and investments to cima labs stockholders to complete the transaction 
we expect to use our remaining cash  cash equivalents and investments for working capital and general corporate purposes  including the acquisition of businesses  products  product rights  or technologies  the payment of contractual obligations  including scheduled interest payments on our convertible notes  and or the purchase  redemption or retirement of our convertible notes 
at this time  we cannot accurately predict the effect of certain developments on the rate of sales growth in and beyond  such as the degree of market acceptance and exclusivity of our products  the impact of competition  the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and the outcome of our current efforts to develop new products and formulations of our existing products and to demonstrate the utility of our products in indications beyond those already included in the fda approved labels 
however  we expect that sales of our three most significant marketed products  provigil  actiq and gabitril  in combination with other revenues  should allow us to generate profits and positive cash flows from operations in the near term 
based on our current level of operations and projected sales of our products combined with other revenues and interest income  we also believe that we will be able to service our existing debt and meet our capital expenditure and working capital requirements in the near term 
however  we cannot be sure that our anticipated revenue growth will be realized or that we will continue to generate significant positive cash flow from operations 
we may need to obtain additional funding for future significant strategic transactions  to repay our outstanding indebtedness or for our future operational needs  and we cannot be certain that funding will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
products analysis of prescription data for our products in the united states indicates that physicians elected to prescribe provigil  gabitril and actiq to treat a number of indications outside of their labeled indications 
our strategy for provigil and gabitril has been to broaden the ranges of clinical uses that are approved by the fda and european regulatory agencies to include many of the currently prescribed uses 
in january  we received approval from the fda to expand the label for provigil to include improving wakefulness in patients with excessive sleepiness associated with swsd and osa hs 
we believe that new indications for provigil  coupled with a larger sales force  had a meaningful and positive impact on provigil sales in continued sales growth of provigil beyond the december expiration of orphan drug exclusivity depends  in part  on our maintaining protection on the modafinil particle size patent through its expiration beginning in see commitments and contingencies legal proceedings above 
if we complete clinical studies of provigil in pediatric patients that are agreeable to the fda  the fda could grant us a six month extension of our current exclusivity and of the particle size patent 
future growth of modafinil based product sales in and beyond also will depend on our ability to achieve fda approval of nuvigil and attenace 
our sales of actiq also depend on our existing patent protection for the approved compressed powder formulation  which expires in the us in september  and for the previous formulation of actiq  which expires in may see commitments and contingencies legal proceedings above 
if we complete clinical studies in pediatric patients that are agreeable to the fda  the fda could grant us six months of exclusivity beyond the september compressed powder patent expiration 
however  even with this additional exclusivity  barr s license to the actiq patents could become effective as early as the launch of oravescent fentanyl expected in late  and in no event later than february  the entry of barr with a generic form of actiq beginning in late or early likely will significantly and negatively impact future actiq sales and could potentially have a negative impact on sales of oravescent fentanyl  if approved 
clinical studies in  we incurred significant expenditures related to conducting clinical studies to develop new pharmaceutical products and exploring the utility of our existing products in treating disorders beyond those currently approved in their respective labels 
in and beyond  we expect to increase the level of our research and development activities  including clinical trials  for our other product candidates  and for improved formulations for our existing products 
with respect to gabitril  we have initiated a phase clinical program evaluating gabitril for the treatment of gad 
with respect to new product candidates  we are continuing phase clinical trials of oravescent fentanyl for the treatment of breakthrough cancer pain and our phase studies of cep for the treatment of parkinson s disease 
we also are continuing clinical development of cep and cep for treatment of certain malignancies 
we may seek to mitigate the risk in our research and development programs by seeking sources of funding for a portion of these expenses through collaborative arrangements with third parties 
however  we intend to retain a portion of the commercial rights to these programs and  as a result  we still expect to spend significant funds on our share of the cost of these programs  including the costs of research  preclinical development  clinical research and manufacturing 
manufacturing  selling and marketing efforts we also expect to continue to incur significant expenditures associated with manufacturing  selling and marketing our products 
in  we purchased approximately acres of land adjacent to our current facilities in salt lake city for approximately million and began a nearly million capital expansion that will be substantially completed by late and that will increase our actiq capacity and provide us with flexibility to manufacture other products 
indebtedness we have significant indebtedness outstanding  consisting principally of indebtedness on convertible subordinated notes 
the following table summarizes the principal terms of our most significant convertible subordinated notes outstanding as of december  security aggregate principal balance outstanding in millions conversion price other convertible subordinated notes due december redeemable on or after december  at our option at a redemption price of of the principal amount redeemed 
zero coupon convertible notes due june  first putable june  redeemable on june  at either option of holder or us at a redemption price of of the principal amount redeemed 
zero coupon convertible notes due june  first putable june  redeemable on june  at either option of holder or us at a redemption price of of the principal amount redeemed 
stated conversion prices as per the terms of the notes 
however  each convertible note contains certain terms restricting a holder s ability to convert the notes  including that a holder may only convert if the closing price of our stock on the day prior to conversion is higher than or with respect to the notes or the notes  respectively 
if the restrictions on conversion are satisfied  we would classify the then aggregate outstanding principal balance of the notes and or the notes as a current liability on our balance sheet 
for a more complete description of these notes  including the related convertible note hedge strategy  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the annual interest payments on our convertible notes outstanding as of december  are million  payable at various dates throughout the year 
in the future  we may agree to exchanges of the notes for shares of our common stock or debt  or may determine to use a portion of our existing cash on hand to purchase  redeem or retire all or a portion of the outstanding convertible notes 
in january  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution relating to our convertible notes in the aggregate notional amount of million 
although we exchanged million of these notes in july for  shares of our common stock  the interest rate swap remains at million 
under the swap  we agreed to pay a variable interest rate on this million notional amount equal to libor bba 
in exchange for the financial institution s agreement to pay a fixed rate of 
the variable interest rate is re calculated at the beginning of each quarter 
effective january   the interest rate is 
we also agreed to provide the financial institution with cash collateral to support our obligations under the agreement 
the current collateral amount is million and is recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
acquisition strategy as part of our business strategy  we plan to consider and  as appropriate  make acquisitions of other businesses  products  product rights or technologies 
our cash reserves and other liquid assets may be inadequate to consummate these acquisitions and it may be necessary for us to raise substantial additional funds in the future to complete these transactions 
in addition  as a result of our acquisition efforts  we are likely to experience significant charges to earnings for merger and related expenses whether or not our efforts are successful that may include transaction costs  closure costs or acquired in process research and development charges 
in february  we filed with the sec a billion universal shelf registration statement covering the issuance and sale from time to time  of common and preferred stock  debt securities and warrants 
while we have no current plans to access the capital markets  the shelf registration statement would allow us to expediently access capital markets periodically in the future 
other we may experience significant fluctuations in quarterly results based primarily on the level and timing of product sales and cost of product sales  inventory stocking or destocking practices of our three largest customers  achievement and timing of research and development milestones  collaboration revenues  cost and timing of clinical trials  marketing and other expenses  and manufacturing or supply disruptions 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are developed  and challenged periodically  by management based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in item of this form k 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and most demanding of their judgment 
management considers the following policies to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties associated with the complex judgments made by us that could impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
revenue recognition in the united states  we sell our products to pharmaceutical wholesalers  the largest three of which account for of our worldwide net sales for the year ended december  decisions made by these wholesalers and their customers regarding the levels of inventory they hold and thus the amount of product they purchase from us are outside of our control and can materially affect the level of our sales in any particular period 
to the extent possible  we attempt to minimize these fluctuations  both by providing  from time to time  discounts to our customers to stock normal amounts of inventory and by canceling orders if we believe a particular customer is speculatively buying inventory in anticipation of possible price increases 
however  we do not have any agreements  understandings or business practices under which we extend incentives based on levels of inventory held by wholesalers 
as of december   we received information from our three largest us wholesaler customers about the levels of inventory they held for our three products 
based on this information  which we have not independently verified  we believe that inventory held at these wholesalers is within a normal range for our business of approximately one month s supply 
however  we currently do not have ongoing agreements for access to the actual inventory levels of our products held by our wholesalers or their customers 
sales recorded for the year ended december  were generally representative of underlying demand for the products 
product sales are recognized upon the transfer of ownership and risk of loss for the product to the customer 
in the united states  we sell all commercial products fob shipping point 
transfer of ownership and risk of loss for the product pass to the customer at the point that the product is picked up by a common carrier for shipment to the customer 
in europe  product sales are recognized predominantly upon customer receipt of the product  except in certain contractual arrangements where different terms may be specified 
other revenue  which includes revenues from collaborative agreements  consists primarily of up front fees  ongoing research and development funding  milestone payments and payments under co promotional or managed services agreements 
non refundable up front fees are deferred and amortized to revenue over the related performance period 
we estimate our performance period based on the specific terms of each collaborative agreement 
we adjust the performance periods  if appropriate  based upon available facts and circumstances 
we recognize periodic payments over the period that we perform the related activities under the terms of the agreements 
revenue resulting from the achievement of milestone events stipulated in the agreements is recognized when the milestone is achieved 
milestones are based upon the occurrence of a substantive element specified in the contract or as a measure of substantive progress towards completion under the contract 
payments under co promotional or managed services agreements are recognized over the period when the products are sold or the promotional activities are performed 
the portion of the payments that represent reimbursement of our expenses is recognized as an offset to those expenses in our results of operations 
gross to net sales adjustments we record product sales net of the following significant categories of gross to net sales adjustments prompt payment discounts  returns  coupons  medicaid discounts and managed care and governmental contracts 
calculating each of these items involves significant estimates and judgments and requires us to use information from external sources 
prompt payment discounts we offer our us wholesaler customers a prompt pay cash discount as an incentive to remit payment within the first thirty days after the date of the invoice 
prompt pay discount calculations are based on the gross amount of each invoice 
we account for these discounts by reducing sales by the discount amount when product is sold  and apply earned cash discounts at the time of payment 
since we began selling our products commercially in  our customers routinely take advantage of this discount 
based on common industry practices and our customers overall payment performance  we accrue for cash discounts on all us sales recorded during the period 
we adjust the accrual to reflect actual experience as necessary and  as a result  the actual amount recognized in any period may be slightly different from our accrual amount 
returns customers can return short dated or expired product that meets the guidelines set forth in our return goods policy 
product shelf life from the date of manufacture for provigil is years  gabitril is to years  depending on product strength  and actiq is years 
returns are accepted from wholesalers and retail pharmacies 
wholesaler customers can return short dated product with six months or less shelf life remaining and expired product within twelve months following the expiration date 
retail pharmacy are not permitted to return short dated product but can return full or partial quantities of expired product only within twelve months following the expiration date 
we base our estimates of product returns for each of our products on the percentage of returns that we have experienced historically 
notwithstanding this  we may adjust our estimate of product returns if we are aware of other factors that we believe could meaningfully impact our expected return percentages 
these factors could include  among others  our estimates of inventory levels of our products in the distribution channel  known sales trends and existing or anticipated competitive market forces such as product entrants and or pricing changes 
in  we recorded a provision for returns at a weighted average rate of of gross sales  which is consistent with our actual historical return percentages 
the other factors described above did not have a significant impact in on our estimate of product returns 
actual returns could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future returns activity because of several factors  including  among other things  wholesaler and retailer stocking patterns and or competition 
if the returns provision percentage were to increase by of gross sales  then an additional provision of million would result 
as described above  we estimate wholesaler inventory as of december  to equal approximately one month s supply 
based on fourth quarter sales  we believe a reasonable estimate of our maximum exposure for potential product returns as of december  is approximately million for provigil  million for actiq and million for gabitril 
coupons we offer patients the opportunity to obtain free samples of our products through a program whereby physicians provide coupons to qualified patients for redemption at retail pharmacies 
we reimburse retail pharmacies for the cost of these products through a third party administrator 
we recognize the estimated cost of this reimbursement as a reduction of gross sales when product is sold 
in addition  we maintain an accrual for unused coupons based on inventory in the distribution channel and historical coupon usage rates and adjust this accrual whenever changes in such coupon usage rates occur 
in  we recorded a provision for coupons at a weighted average rate of of gross sales 
actual coupon usage could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future coupon activity 
if the coupons provision percentage were to increase by of gross sales  then an additional provision of million would result 
medicaid discounts we record accruals for rebates to be provided through governmental rebate programs  such as the medicaid drug rebate program  as a reduction of sales when product is sold 
these reductions are based on historical rebate amounts and trends of sales eligible for these governmental programs for a period  as well as any expected changes to the trends of our total product sales 
in addition  we estimate the expected unit rebate amounts to be used and adjust our rebate accruals based on the expected changes in rebate pricing 
rebate amounts are generally invoiced and paid quarterly in arrears  so that our accrual consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s activity  plus an accrual for prior quarters unpaid rebates and an accrual for inventory in the distribution channel 
in  we recorded a provision for medicaid discounts at a weighted average rate of of gross sales 
actual medicaid discounts could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future medicaid patient activity or unit rebate amounts 
if the medicaid discounts provision percentage were to increase by of gross sales  then an additional provision of million would result 
managed care and governmental agreements we have entered into agreements with certain managed care customers whereby we provide agreed upon discounts to such entities based on sales volume 
we record accruals for these discounts as a reduction of sales when product is sold based on the discount rates and expected levels of sales volume of these managed care customers during a period 
we estimate eligible sales based on historical amounts and trends of sales by these entities and on any expected changes to the trends of our product sales 
discounts are generally invoiced and paid quarterly in arrears  so that our accrual consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s activity  plus an accrual for prior quarters unpaid rebates and an accrual for inventory in the distribution channel 
we have entered into agreements with certain governmental customers other than medicaid whereby we provide legislatively mandated discounts and rebates to such entities 
we record accruals for these discounts and rebates as a reduction of sales when product is sold based on the discount amounts and expected levels of performance of these governmental customers during a period 
we estimate eligible sales based on historical sales amounts and trends of sales by these entities and on any expected changes to the trends of our product sales 
generally  discounts are granted to governmental customers by our wholesalers at time of purchase 
in other cases  rebates are paid directly to governmental customers based on reported levels of patient usage 
wholesalers charge these discounts and rebates back to us generally within one to three months 
we record accruals for our estimate of unprocessed chargebacks related to sales made during the period based on an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s sales  plus an accrual based on the amount of inventory in the distribution channel 
in  we recorded a provision for managed care and governmental contracts at a weighted average rate of of gross sales 
actual chargebacks and rebates could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future participation in these programs 
if the chargebacks and rebates provision percentage were to increase by of gross sales  then an additional provision of million would result 
the following table summarizes activity in each of the above categories for the years ended december  and in thousands prompt payment discounts returns coupons medicaid discounts managed care and governmental agreements total balance at january     provision current period      prior periods  total       actual current period      prior periods      total       balance at december      provision current period      prior periods   total      actual current period      prior periods      total       balance at december  given our return goods policy  we assume that all returns in a current year relate to prior period sales 
inventories our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  and include the cost of raw materials  labor  overhead and shipping and handling costs 
cost is computed on domestic inventories using the last in  first out lifo method 
for the majority of our foreign inventories  the first in  first out fifo method is utilized 
the majority of our inventories are subject to expiration dating 
we regularly evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and when  in our opinion  factors indicate that impairment has occurred  we establish a reserve against the inventories carrying value 
our determination that a valuation reserve might be required  in addition to the quantification of such reserve  requires us to utilize significant judgment 
we base our analysis  in part  on the level of inventories on hand in relation to our estimated forecast of product demand  production requirements over the next months and the expiration dates of inventories 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated decreases in demand could have a material impact on the carrying value of our inventories and our reported operating results 
to date  inventory adjustments have not been material 
we capitalize inventory costs associated with marketed products and certain products prior to regulatory approval and product launch  based on management s judgment of probable future commercial use and net realizable value 
we could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval or pre launch inventory upon a change in such judgment  due to a denial or delay of approval by regulatory bodies  a delay in commercialization  or other potential factors 
at december   we had million of capitalized inventory costs 
valuation of property and equipment  intangible assets  goodwill and investments our property and equipment have been recorded at cost and are being depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of those assets 
our intangible assets which consist primarily of developed technology  trademarks  and product and marketing rights  are amortized over estimated useful lives which are intended to approximate the estimated pattern of economic benefits generated by the asset 
determining the estimated pattern of economic benefit for an intangible asset is a highly subjective and difficult assessment 
to the extent that the pattern cannot be reliably determined  a straight line amortization method has been used 
in conjunction with acquisitions of businesses or product rights  we allocate the purchase price based upon the relative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over net assets acquired 
in certain circumstances  fair value may be assigned to purchased in process research and development and  as such  expensed immediately 
we regularly assess whether intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill have been impaired and adjust the carrying values of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that some or all of the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operating performances of our businesses and products 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the carrying values of our property and equipment  intangible assets or goodwill are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
if we determine that events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of our company and its goodwill  we would consult with one or more valuation specialists in estimating the impact of these on our estimate of fair value 
we believe the estimation methods are reasonable and reflective of common valuation practices 
we evaluate the recoverability and measure the possible impairment of our goodwill under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the impairment test is a two step process that begins with the estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit 
the first step screens for potential impairment  and the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
our estimate of fair value considers publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of our company  as well as i publicly available information regarding comparable publicly traded companies in the pharmaceutical industry  ii the financial projections and future prospects of our business  including our growth opportunities and likely operational improvements  and iii comparable sales prices  if available 
as part of the first step to assess potential impairment  we compare our estimate of fair value for the company to the book value of our consolidated net assets 
if the book value of our consolidated net assets were greater than our estimate of fair value  we would then proceed to the second step to measure the impairment  if any 
the second step measures the amount of impairment by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying value 
the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination  and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill is greater than its implied fair value  an impairment loss will be recognized in the amount of the excess 
we performed our annual test of impairment of goodwill as of july  we have only one reporting unit  a biopharmaceutical unit  that constitutes our entire business 
we compared the fair value of this reporting unit with its carrying value 
the quoted market value of the outstanding shares of our common stock on the nasdaq national market at july  was used as the fair value of the reporting unit 
since the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value at july   no adjustment to our goodwill for impairment was necessary 
we updated our test of impairment of goodwill as of september  in conjunction with our acquisition of cima labs  and again concluded that no adjustment to our goodwill for impairment was necessary 
we evaluate our investments in non marketable securities of outside entities on a quarterly basis by reviewing key indicators of the entities financial performance  condition and outlook 
we review the entities most recent financial statements and discuss the entities current and future financial and operational strategies with their senior management personnel 
we also discuss with our senior research and development personnel the current status of and future expectations for any collaborative agreements we have with those entities 
based on this information  we make a determination as to whether any impairment in the carrying value of our investments exists 
this determination is a highly subjective process that is based on the evaluation of qualitative information and numerous assumptions as to future events 
nonetheless  we believe our evaluation process provides a reasonable basis for our determination 
our evaluation process led us to conclude that we should record impairment charges in and in  we recorded a million charge relating to the write off as r d expense of the value of an investment in an unaffiliated entity 
in january  we purchased from mds proteomics inc mdsp  a privately held canadian company and a subsidiary of mds inc  a million convertible note due and entered into a five year research agreement focused on accelerating the clinical development of our pipeline of small chemical compounds 
in  mdsp determined to change its business model to focus upon the provision of services to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  which it believes can lead to nearer term revenue and profitability 
on july   mdsp completed its reorganization under canada s companies creditors arrangement act and changed its name to protana inc as part of the reorganization  we agreed to terminate our research agreement with protana and cancel the million convertible note we held in return for shares of class a preferred stock and common stock of protana 
in light of the restructuring of protana and the uncertain business prospects for the company  we determined that the carrying value of our investment was fully impaired and we recorded an impairment charge of million  which also included transaction costs  in our second quarter of results of operations 
income taxes we provide for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities 
prior to  we had a history of losses from our operations  which generated significant international  federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if we believe that we are not likely to realize future tax benefits 
based on our profitability for the year ended december  and projected future results  in the fourth quarter of  we concluded that it was likely that we would be able to realize a significant portion of the deferred tax assets  and therefore  we reversed a significant portion of the valuation allowance 
as a result  beginning in  we began providing for income taxes at a rate equal to our estimated annual combined federal  state and foreign statutory effective rates 
subsequent adjustments to our estimates of our ability to recover the deferred tax assets or other changes in circumstances or estimates could cause our provision for income taxes to vary from period to period 
at the end of  we retained a valuation allowance of million against a total deferred tax asset balance of million 
we believe that this reserve is appropriate given the significant risks which face the company related to the potential introduction of generic competition for provigil and actiq before the end of  and the uncertainties surrounding the development  fda approval and successful commercialization of nuvigil  attenace and oravescent fentanyl 
we will continue to reassess our ability to realize the future tax benefits of our deferred tax assets and adjust our valuation allowance  if necessary 
without approval and successful commercialization of these new products  it is not likely that we will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets that currently have a valuation allowance against them 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued a revision to sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
this statement requires additional disclosures about the assets  obligations  cash flows  and net periodic benefit costs of defined benefit plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
this statement is effective for fiscal years ending after december   except for certain disclosures about foreign plans which are effective for fiscal years ending after june  since all of our pension and postretirement benefit plans are foreign plans  we have adopted the additional disclosure requirements of this statement effective december  in march  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf reached consensus on issue this issue is intended to clarify what is a participating security for purposes of applying sfas no 
 earnings per share 
the issue also provides further guidance on how to apply the two class method of computing earnings per share eps once it is determined that a security is participating  including how to allocate undistributed earnings to such a security 
we adopted this issue in the second quarter of and determined that our convertible subordinated notes were participating securities as defined by this issue 
although none of the convertible notes are outstanding at december   net income loss used for basic and diluted income loss per share is allocated to the common shares using a ratio of weighted average common shares outstanding and weighted average participating securities  using the if converted method 
our previously reported earnings per share have been restated as required by eitf issue the effect on our basic eps for the years ended december  and was a decrease of and per share  respectively 
the effect on our diluted eps for the years ended december  and was a decrease of per share in each of the years 
there was no effect on our basic and diluted eps for any periods prior to december  in september  the eitf reached consensus on issue  accounting issues related to certain features of contingently convertible debt and the effects on diluted earnings per share 
this issue requires the inclusion of convertible shares for contingently convertible debt in the calculation of diluted eps regardless of whether the contingency has been met  if the effect is dilutive 
the issue is effective for periods ending after december  and requires the restatement of previously reported eps 
in december  we exchanged million of our zero coupon convertible notes for notes with substantially the same terms and conditions 
however  the contingent conversion feature is no longer considered when calculating diluted earnings per share under eitf the remaining million of unexchanged zero coupon convertible notes have not been included in the calculation of diluted eps for the year ended december  as the effect is anti dilutive 
for the year ended december   the inclusion of the unexchanged zero coupon convertible notes using the if converted method had no effect on diluted eps 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  which requires abnormal amounts of idle capacity and spoilage costs to be excluded from the cost of inventory and expensed when incurred 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we believe the adoption of this statement will not impact our current financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  a revision of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
this statement requires that an entity measure the cost of equity based service awards based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognize the cost of such awards over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the vesting period 
the statement requires that an entity measure the cost of liability based service awards based on current fair value that is remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  we will adopt this new standard effective july  which will require us to recognize share based compensation expense in our statement of operations 
we have not yet quantified the impact this statement will have on our future results but we expect that it will be material 
in december  the fasb issued staff position no 
fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp no 
 and staff position no 
fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp no 

these staff positions provide accounting guidance on how companies should account for the effects of the american jobs creation act of ajca that was signed into law on october  fsp no 
states that the tax relief special tax deduction for domestic manufacturing from this legislation should be accounted for as a special deduction instead of a tax rate reduction 
fsp no 
gives a company additional time to evaluate the effects of the legislation on any plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying fasb statement no 
we are currently assessing both provisions to determine the impact they could have on our future income tax expense 
we expect to complete this evaluation within a reasonable amount of time after additional guidance from the united states treasury is published 
certain risks related to our business you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information contained in this report  before making an investment decision 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be harmed by any of these risks 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks not presently known to us or other factors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time also may impair our business operations 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from us sales of our three largest products  and our future success will depend on the continued acceptance and growth of these products 
for the year ended december   approximately of our worldwide net sales were derived from sales of provigil  actiq and gabitril 
we cannot be certain that these products will continue to be accepted in their markets 
specifically  the following factors  among others  could affect the level of market acceptance of provigil  actiq and gabitril a change in the perception of the healthcare community of their safety and efficacy  both in an absolute sense and relative to that of competing products  the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts  any unfavorable publicity regarding these products or similar products  the price of the product relative to other competing drugs or treatments  including potential generic forms of our products  any changes in government and other third party payer reimbursement policies and practices  and regulatory developments affecting the manufacture  marketing or use of these products 
any material adverse developments with respect to the sale or use of provigil  actiq and gabitril could significantly reduce our product revenues and have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate net income and positive net cash flow from operations 
we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to obtain regulatory approval for new products or for new formulations or indications for our existing products  which would significantly hamper future sales and earnings growth 
our prospects  particularly with respect to the growth of our future sales and earnings  depend substantially on our ability to obtain fda approval for our four near term product candidates nuvigil  attenace  oravescent fentanyl and gabitril for gad 
recently  we filed an snda with the fda seeking approval for the use of attenace for adhd in children and expect to file in march an nda seeking approval for nuvigil 
we do not know whether we will succeed in obtaining regulatory approval to market these products or what level of market acceptance these products may achieve  particularly if we ultimately face competition in the form of a generic version of provigil 
we also have not yet completed phase studies of gabitril for use in treating gad 
if the results of some of these additional studies are negative or adverse  this could undermine physician and patient comfort with the current product  limit its commercial success  and diminish its acceptance 
even if the results of these studies are positive  the impact on sales of gabitril may be minimal unless we are able to obtain regulatory approval to expand the authorized uses of this product 
fda regulations limit our ability to communicate the results of additional clinical studies to patients and physicians without first obtaining regulatory approval for any expanded uses 
finally  we are continuing phase clinical studies of oravescent fentanyl for treatment of breakthrough cancer pain 
as with our gabitril studies  we do not know whether these studies will demonstrate safety and efficacy  or if they do  whether we will succeed in receiving regulatory approval to market this product 
even if we obtain regulatory approval for oravescent fentanyl  the availability of a generic version of actiq at that time could significantly and negatively impact sales of oravescent fentanyl 
we may not be able to maintain adequate protection for our intellectual property or market exclusivity for certain of our products and  therefore  competitors may develop competing products  which could result in a decrease in sales and market share  cause us to reduce prices to compete successfully and limit our commercial success 
we place considerable importance on obtaining patent protection for new technologies  products and processes 
to that end  we file applications for patents covering the compositions or uses of our drug candidates or our proprietary processes 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal  scientific and factual questions 
to date  no consistent policy has emerged regarding breadth of claims in such companies patents 
accordingly  the patents and patent applications relating to our products  product candidates and technologies may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented by third parties and might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technology 
patent disputes in our industry are frequent and can preclude commercialization of products 
if we ultimately engage in and lose any such disputes  we could be subject to competition or significant liabilities  we could be required to enter into third party licenses or we could be required to cease using technology or product in dispute 
in addition  even if such licenses are available  the terms of any license requested by a third party could be unacceptable to us 
provigil the us composition of matter patent for modafinil expired in we own us and foreign patent rights that expire between and and cover pharmaceutical compositions and uses of modafinil  specifically  certain particle sizes of modafinil contained in the pharmaceutical composition 
ultimately  these patents might be found invalid as the result of a challenge by a third party  or a potential competitor could develop a competing product or product formulation that avoids infringement of these patents 
to date  the fda has accepted six andas for pharmaceutical products containing modafinil 
each of these andas contain a paragraph iv certification in which the anda applicant certified that the us particle size modafinil patent covering provigil either is invalid or will not be infringed by the anda product 
we have filed patent infringement lawsuits in us district court in new jersey against teva pharmaceuticals usa  inc  mylan pharmaceuticals inc  ranbaxy pharmaceuticals inc  barr laboratories  inc 
and sandoz inc 
based upon the andas filed by each of these companies with the fda 
the lawsuit claims infringement of our us patent no 
re  each of the defendants has asserted defenses and or counterclaims for non infringement and or patent invalidity  and defendants teva  ranbaxy and mylan have moved to amend their answers and counterclaims to state inequitable conduct as a defense to our claims we have opposed the motions and a decision is pending 
these lawsuits are currently in the discovery phase  we expect a trial to begin no earlier than late we also recently filed suit against carlsbad with respect to the anda they have filed with the fda and discovery in this action has not yet commenced 
while we intend to vigorously defend the validity of this patent and prevent infringement  these efforts will be both expensive and time consuming and  ultimately  may not be successful 
barr  mylan and ranbaxy have each announced the receipt of tentative fda approval for their respective generic versions of provigil 
under the provisions of the hatch waxman act  we are entitled to a month stay of final fda approval of these generic versions of provigil 
this stay precludes these companies from selling a modafinil based product until the earlier to occur of the conclusion of the lawsuit or june however  if the court finds our particle size patent is invalid or not infringed  these companies could begin selling their modafinil based products upon the expiration of our fda orphan drug exclusivity  currently in december  which would significantly and negatively impact revenues from provigil 
we do not know whether the andas filed by teva  sandoz and carlsbad have been  or will be  tentatively approved by the fda 
if we complete clinical studies of provigil in pediatric patients that are acceptable to the fda  the fda could grant us a six month extension of our orphan drug exclusivity to june and six months of exclusivity beyond the expiration of the particle size patent term 
actiq with respect to actiq  we hold an exclusive license to a us patents covering the currently approved compressed powder pharmaceutical composition and methods for administering fentanyl via this composition that are set to expire in september corresponding patents in foreign countries are set to expire between and our patent protection with respect to the actiq formulation we sold prior to june will expire in may if we complete an additional clinical study in pediatric patients that is agreeable to the fda  the fda could grant us six months of exclusivity beyond the september compressed powder patent expiration 
however  even with this additional exclusivity  barr s license to the actiq patents under the license and supply agreement could become effective as early as the launch of oravescent fentanyl expected in late  and in no event later than february  in december  we announced that fda had acknowledged receipt of an anda filed by barr seeking approval for a generic form of actiq 
in january  we filed a patent infringement lawsuit against barr to defend our patents until the license effective date 
neither the anda filing nor the lawsuit modify the existing license grant to barr  and we do not expect any change in the anticipated date of barr s entry to market absent resolution of the lawsuit 
the entry of barr with a generic form of actiq likely will significantly and negatively impact future actiq sales 
gabitril with respect to gabitril  there are four us composition of matter patents covering the currently approved product a patent claiming tiagabine  the active drug substance in gabitril  a patent claiming crystalline tiagabine hydrochloride monohydrate and its use as an anti epileptic agent  a patent claiming the pharmaceutical formulation  and a patent claiming anhydrous crystalline tiagabine hydrochloride and processes for its preparation 
these patents currently are set to expire in   and  respectively 
supplemental protection certificates based upon corresponding foreign patents covering this product are set to expire in ultimately  these patents might be found invalid as the result of a challenge by a third party  or a potential competitor could develop a competing product or product formulation that avoids infringement of these patents 
we also rely on trade secrets  know how and continuing technological advancements to support our competitive position 
although we have entered into confidentiality and invention rights agreements with our employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators  these parties could fail to honor such agreements or we could be unable to effectively protect our rights to our unpatented trade secrets and know how 
moreover  others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know how 
in addition  many of our scientific and management personnel have been recruited from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies where they were conducting research in areas similar to those that we now pursue 
as a result  we could be subject to allegations of trade secret violations and other claims 
our activities and products are subject to significant government regulations and approvals  which are often costly and could result in adverse consequences to our business if we fail to comply 
we currently have a number of products that have been approved for sale in the united states  foreign countries or both 
all of our approved products are subject to extensive continuing regulations relating to  among other things  testing  manufacturing  quality control  labeling  and promotion 
the failure to comply with any rules and regulations of the fda or any foreign medical authority  or the post approval discovery of previously unknown problems relating to our products  could result in  among other things fines  recalls or seizures of products  total or partial suspension of manufacturing or commercial activities  non approval of product license applications  restrictions on our ability to enter into strategic relationships  and criminal prosecution 
in september  we announced that we had received subpoenas from the us attorney s office in philadelphia with respect to provigil  actiq and gabitril 
this investigation is ongoing and appears to be focused on our sales and promotional practices 
we are cooperating with the investigation and are providing documents to the government 
in addition  we have engaged in ongoing discussions with the attorney general in pennsylvania regarding recent media reports of instances of abuse and diversion of actiq 
we have had similar discussions with the office of the connecticut attorney general  in september  we received a voluntary request for information from the office of the connecticut attorney general asking us to provide information generally relating to our sales and promotional practices for our us products 
we have agreed to comply with this voluntary request 
these matters may involve the bringing of criminal charges and fines  and or civil penalties 
we cannot predict or determine the outcome of these matters or reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of any fines or penalties that might result from an adverse outcome 
however  an adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
it is both costly and time consuming for us to comply with these inquiries and regulations 
additionally  incidents of adverse drug reactions  unintended side effects or misuse relating to our products could result in additional regulatory controls or restrictions  or even lead to withdrawal of a product from the market 
with respect to our product candidates and for new therapeutic indications for our existing products  we conduct research  preclinical testing and clinical trials  each of which requires us to comply with extensive government regulations 
we cannot market these product candidates or these new indications in the united states or other countries without receiving approval from the fda or the appropriate foreign medical authority 
the approval process is highly uncertain and requires substantial time  effort and financial resources 
ultimately  we may never obtain approval in a timely manner  or at all 
without these required approvals  our ability to substantially grow revenues in the future could be adversely affected 
in addition  because provigil and actiq contain active ingredients that are controlled substances  we are subject to regulation by the dea and analogous foreign organizations relating to the manufacture  shipment  sale and use of the applicable products 
these regulations also are imposed on prescribing physicians and other third parties  making the storage  transport and use of such products relatively complicated and expensive 
with the increased concern for safety by the fda and the dea with respect to products containing controlled substances and the heightened level of media attention given to this issue  it is possible that these regulatory agencies could impose additional restrictions on marketing or even withdraw regulatory approval for such products 
in addition  adverse publicity may bring about a rejection of the product by the medical community 
if the dea  fda or a foreign medical authority withdrew the approval of  or placed additional significant restrictions on the marketing of any of our products  our product sales and ability to promote our products could be substantially affected 
we rely on third parties for the timely supply of specified raw materials  equipment  contract manufacturing  formulation or packaging services  product distribution services  customer service activities and product returns processing 
although we actively manage these third party relationships to ensure continuity and quality  some events beyond our control could result in the complete or partial failure of these goods and services 
any such failure could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operations 
manufacturing  supply and distribution problems may create supply disruptions that could result in a reduction of product sales revenue and an increase in costs of sales  and damage commercial prospects for our products 
the manufacture  supply and distribution of pharmaceutical products  both inside and outside the united states  is highly regulated and complex 
we  and the third parties we rely upon for the manufacturing and distribution of our products  must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements of the fda and foreign authorities  including current good manufacturing practice regulations 
in addition  we must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements of the drug enforcement administration and analogous foreign authorities for certain of our products that contain controlled substances 
the facilities used to manufacture  store and distribute our products also are subject to inspection by regulatory authorities at any time to determine compliance with regulations 
these regulations are complex  and any failure to comply with them could lead to remedial action  civil and criminal penalties and delays in production or distribution of material 
we predominately depend upon single sources for the manufacture of both the active drug substances contained in our products and for finished commercial supplies 
for example provigil our manufacturing facility in france is the sole source of the active drug substance modafinil 
with respect to finished commercial supplies of provigil  we currently have two qualified manufacturers  dsm pharmaceuticals  in greenville  north carolina  and patheon  inc  in ontario  canada 
actiq our us facility in salt lake city  utah  is the sole source for the worldwide manufacture and supply of finished commercial supplies of actiq 
gabitril abbott laboratories manufactures finished commercial supplies of gabitril for the us market through at least december and sanofi synthelabo manufactures gabitril for non us markets through january  although sanofi has agreed to continue to produce gabitril through the end of the second quarter of 
we have identified a third party manufacturer for the future worldwide production of the active drug substance tiagabine and finished commercial supplies of gabitril 
we are in the process of qualifying this manufacturer with appropriate us and european regulatory authorities 
other products certain of our products are manufactured at our facilities in france  with the remaining products manufactured by single source third parties 
cima labs also manufactures products at its minnesota facilities for certain of its pharmaceutical company partners 
the process of changing or adding a manufacturer or changing a formulation requires prior fda and or european medical authority approval and is very time consuming 
if we are unable to manage this process effectively or if an unforeseen event occurs at any facility  we could face supply disruptions that would result in significant costs and delays  undermine goodwill established with physicians and patients  damage commercial prospects for our products and adversely affect operating results 
as our products are used commercially  unintended side effects  adverse reactions or incidents of misuse may occur that could result in additional regulatory controls  adverse publicity and reduced sales of our products 
during research and development  the use of pharmaceutical products  such as ours  is limited principally to clinical trial patients under controlled conditions and under the care of expert physicians 
the widespread commercial use of our products could identify undesirable or unintended side effects that have not been evident in our clinical trials or the relatively limited commercial use to date 
for example  in february  working with the fda  we updated our prescribing information for gabitril to include a bolded warning describing the risk of new onset seizures in non induced patients without epilepsy 
in addition  in patients who take multiple medications  drug interactions could occur that can be difficult to predict 
additionally  incidents of product misuse  product diversion or theft may occur  particularly with respect to products such as actiq and provigil  which contain controlled substances 
these events  among others  could result in adverse publicity that harms the commercial prospects of our products or lead to additional regulatory controls that could limit the circumstances under which the product is prescribed or even lead to the withdrawal of the product from the market 
in particular  actiq has been approved under regulations concerning drugs with certain safety profiles  under which the fda has established special restrictions to ensure safe use 
any violation of these special restrictions could lead to the imposition of further restrictions or withdrawal of the product from the market 
our product sales and related financial results will fluctuate  and these fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall  especially if investors do not anticipate them 
a number of analysts and investors who follow our stock have developed models to attempt to forecast future product sales and expenses  and have established earnings expectations based upon those models 
these models  in turn  are based in part on estimates of projected revenue and earnings that we disclose publicly 
forecasting future revenues is difficult  especially when we only have a few years of commercial history and when the level of market acceptance of our products is changing rapidly 
forecasting is further complicated by the difficulties in estimating both existing inventory levels for our products at pharmaceutical wholesalers and retail pharmacies and the timing of their purchases to replenish these stocks 
as a result  it is likely that our product sales will fluctuate significantly  which may not meet with market expectations and which also may adversely affect our stock price 
there are a number of other factors that could cause our financial results to fluctuate unexpectedly  including cost of product sales  achievement and timing of research and development milestones  collaboration revenues  cost and timing of clinical trials and regulatory approvals  marketing and other expenses  manufacturing or supply disruptions  and costs associated with the operations of recently acquired businesses and technologies 
we face significant product liability risks  which may have a negative effect on our financial performance 
the administration of drugs to humans  whether in clinical trials or commercially  can result in product liability claims whether or not the drugs are actually at fault for causing an injury 
furthermore  our products may cause  or may appear to have caused  adverse side effects including death or potentially dangerous drug interactions that we may not learn about or understand fully until the drug has been administered to patients for some time 
as our products are used more widely and in patients with varying medical conditions  the likelihood of an adverse drug reaction  unintended side effect or incidence of misuse may increase 
product liability claims can be expensive to defend and may result in large judgments or settlements against us  which could have a negative effect on our financial performance 
the costs of product liability insurance have increased significantly in recent years  and the availability of coverage has decreased 
nevertheless  we maintain product liability insurance in amounts we believe to be commercially reasonable 
however  any claims could easily exceed our coverage limits 
even if a product liability claim is not successful  the adverse publicity and time and expense of defending such a claim may interfere with our business 
we may be unable to repay our substantial indebtedness and other obligations 
as of december   we had  million of indebtedness outstanding  including  million outstanding under convertible notes with stated conversion prices or restricted conversion prices higher than our stock price as of the date of this filing 
of our convertible notes outstanding as of the filing date of this report  million mature in there are no restrictions on our use of our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  and we cannot be sure that these funds will be available or sufficient in the future to enable us to repay our indebtedness 
in the future  these factors  among other things  could make it difficult for us to service  repay or refinance our indebtedness or to obtain additional financing  or limit our flexibility and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business 
unless we are able to generate cash flow from operations that  together with our available cash on hand  is sufficient to repay our indebtedness  we will be required to raise additional funds 
because the financing markets may be unwilling to provide funding to us or may only be willing to provide funding on terms that we would consider unacceptable  we may not have cash available or be able to obtain funding to permit us to meet our repayment obligations  thus adversely affecting the market price for our securities 
our customer base is highly concentrated 
our principal customers are wholesale drug distributors 
these customers comprise a significant part of the distribution network for all pharmaceutical products sold in the united states 
three large wholesale distributors  cardinal health  inc  mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen corporation  control a significant share of this network 
these three wholesaler customers  in the aggregate  accounted for of our worldwide net sales for the year ended december  fluctuations in the buying patterns of these customers  which may result from seasonality  wholesaler buying decision or other factors outside of our control  could significantly affect the level of our net sales on a period to period basis 
because of this  the amounts purchased by these customers during any quarterly or annual period may not correlate to the level of underlying demand evidenced by the number of prescriptions written for such products  as reported by ims health incorporated 
furthermore  the loss or bankruptcy of any of these customers could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our internal controls over financial reporting may not be considered effective  which could result in possible regulatory sanctions and a decline in our stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to furnish annually a report on our internal controls over financial reporting  beginning with this annual report on form k 
the internal control report must contain an assessment by our management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting including the disclosure of any material weakness and a statement that our independent auditors have attested to and reported on management s evaluation of such internal controls 
the sarbanes oxley act requires  among other things  that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting 
in order for management to evaluate our internal controls  we must regularly review and document our internal control processes and procedures and test such controls 
ultimately  we or our independent auditors could conclude that our internal control over financial reporting may not be effective if  among others things any material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting exist  or we fail to remediate assessed deficiencies 
due to the number of controls to be examined  the complexity of the project  and the subjectivity involved in determining the effectiveness of controls  we cannot be certain that  in the future  all of our controls will continue to be considered effective by management or  if considered effective by our management  that our auditors will agree with such assessment 
if  in the future  we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective  or if our auditors are unable to attest that our management s report is fairly stated or they are unable to express an opinion on our management s evaluation  we could be subject to regulatory sanctions or lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  either of which could have an adverse effect on the market price for our securities 
the efforts of government entities and third party payers to contain or reduce the costs of health care may adversely affect our sales and limit the commercial success of our products 
in certain foreign markets  pricing or profitability of pharmaceutical products is subject to various forms of direct and indirect governmental control  including the control over the amount of reimbursements provided to the patient who is prescribed specific pharmaceutical products 
for example  we are aware of governmental efforts in france to limit or eliminate reimbursement for some of our products  particularly fonzylane  which could impact revenues from our french operations 
in the united states  there have been  and we expect there will continue to be  various proposals to implement similar controls 
the commercial success of our products could be limited if federal or state governments adopt any such proposals 
in addition  in the united states and elsewhere  sales of pharmaceutical products depend in part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third party payers  such as government and private insurance plans 
these third party payers are increasingly utilizing their significant purchasing power to challenge the prices charged for pharmaceutical products and seek to limit reimbursement levels offered to consumers for such products 
moreover  many governments and private insurance plans have instituted reimbursement schemes that favor the substitution of generic pharmaceuticals for more expensive brand name pharmaceuticals 
in the us in particular  generic substitution statutes have been enacted in virtually all states and permit or require the dispensing pharmacist to substitute a less expensive generic drug instead of an original branded drug 
these third party payers could focus their cost control efforts on our products  especially with respect to prices of and reimbursement levels for products prescribed outside their labeled indications 
in these cases  their efforts could negatively impact our product sales and profitability 
we experience intense competition in our fields of interest  which may adversely affect our business 
large and small companies  academic institutions  governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations conduct research  seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for product development in competition with us 
products developed by any of these entities may compete directly with those we develop or sell 
in addition  our two largest products  provigil and actiq  could face competition from companies seeking to market generic forms of these products if our patent infringement lawsuits against these companies are unsuccessful 
the conditions that our products treat  and some of the other disorders for which we are conducting additional studies  are currently treated with many drugs  several of which have been available for a number of years or are available in inexpensive generic forms 
with respect to provigil  and  if approved  nuvigil  there are several other products used for the treatment of excessive sleepiness or narcolepsy in the united states  including methylphenidate products such as ritalin by novartis  and in our other territories  many of which have been available for a number of years and are available in inexpensive generic forms 
if we are successful in obtaining fda approval of modafinil for the treatment of adhd in children and adolescents  we will face competition from stimulants such as ritalin by novartis  straterra by eli lilly  and concerta by mcneil consumer  as well as from amphetamines such as dexedrine by glaxosmithkline and adderall by shire 
with respect to actiq  we face competition from numerous short and long acting opioid products  including three products johnson johnson s duragesic  purdue pharmaceutical s oxycontin and ms contin that dominate the market as well as purdue s palladone which was approved in september in addition  we are aware of numerous other companies developing other technologies for rapidly delivering opioids to treat breakthrough pain  including transmucosal  transdermal  nasal spray and inhaled delivery systems  among others  that will compete against actiq and  if approved  oravescent fentanyl 
with respect to gabitril  there are several products  including neurontin gabapentin by pfizer  used as adjunctive therapy for the partial seizure market 
some are well established therapies that have been on the market for several years while others have recently entered the partial seizure marketplace 
in addition  several treatments for partial seizures are available in inexpensive generic forms 
if we are successful in our efforts to expand the label of gabitril to include anxiety disorders  we will face significant competition from well established selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ssri products such as paxil  effexor xr and lexapro 
for all of our products  we need to demonstrate to physicians  patients and third party payers that the cost of our products is reasonable and appropriate in the light of their safety and efficacy  the price of competing products and the related health care benefits to the patient 
many of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities than we have  and substantially greater experience in conducting clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products 
these entities represent significant competition for us 
in addition  competitors who are developing products for the treatment of neurological or oncological disorders might succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any that we develop or sell or that would render our technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive 
competition and innovation from these or other sources  including advances in current treatment methods  could potentially affect sales of our products negatively or make our products obsolete 
furthermore  we may be at a competitive marketing disadvantage against companies that have broader product lines and whose sales personnel are able to offer more complementary products than we can 
any failure to maintain our competitive position could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we plan to consider and  as appropriate  make acquisitions of technologies  products and businesses  which may subject us to a number of risks and or result in us experiencing significant charges to earnings that may adversely affect our stock price  operating results and financial condition 
as part of our efforts to acquire businesses or to enter into other significant transactions  we conduct business  legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in the transaction 
despite our efforts  we ultimately may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks and  as a result  we might not realize the intended advantages of the acquisition 
we also must consolidate and integrate the operations of an acquired business with our business 
integration efforts often take a significant amount of time  place a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources and could prove to be more difficult and expensive than we predicted 
if we fail to realize the expected benefits from acquisitions we may consummate in the future  whether as a result of unidentified risks  integration difficulties  regulatory setbacks or other events  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in our acquisition of cima labs  we secured rights to the product development candidate  oravescent fentanyl  as well as cima labs existing drug delivery business 
we estimated a value for oravescent fentanyl by making certain assumptions about  among other things  the likelihood and timing of oravescent fentanyl approval and the potential market for the product 
this estimated value of oravescent fentanyl comprised a significant portion of the total consideration we paid to cima labs stockholders 
ultimately  our assumptions may prove to be incorrect  which could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the cima labs transaction 
in addition  we have experienced  and will likely continue to experience  significant charges to earnings related to our efforts to consummate acquisitions 
for transactions that ultimately are not consummated  these charges may include fees and expenses for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants and other advisers in connection with our efforts 
even if our efforts are successful  we may incur as part of a transaction substantial charges for closure costs associated with the elimination of duplicate operations and facilities and acquired in process research and development charges 
in either case  the incurrence of these charges could adversely affect our results of operations for particular quarterly or annual periods 
the failure to successfully integrate cima labs could negatively impact our results of operations 
the integration of cima labs following our august acquisition involves a number of risks and presents financial  managerial and operational challenges  including diversion of management attention from our existing operations  difficulty with integration of personnel  and accounting  financial reporting  internal control and other systems  and increased operations that may be difficult to manage  especially since we have limited experience in drug delivery technologies 
in light of these challenges  we may not be able to successfully manage the operations and personnel of cima labs 
customer dissatisfaction  manufacturing  supply or distribution problems associated with the products that utilize cima labs technology and intense competition in the filed of drug delivery technology could cause its pharmaceutical business to underperform relative to our expectations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we also could experience financial or other setbacks if cima labs business has problems or liabilities of which we were not aware or that are substantially greater than we anticipated based on our evaluation of the business prior to the acquisition 
currently  a significant majority of cima labs revenues are derived from only three customers 
the loss of any one of these customers  or a decline in the market acceptance of the products we develop and manufacture for them  could significantly impact revenues from the cima labs business 
the results and timing of our research and development activities  including future clinical trials  are difficult to predict  subject to potential future setbacks and  ultimately  may not result in viable pharmaceutical products  which may adversely affect our business 
in order to sustain our business  we focus substantial resources on the search for new pharmaceutical products 
these activities include engaging in discovery research and process development  conducting preclinical and clinical studies and seeking regulatory approval in the united states and abroad 
in all of these areas  we have relatively limited resources and compete against larger  multinational pharmaceutical companies 
moreover  even if we undertake these activities in an effective and efficient manner  regulatory approval for the sale of new pharmaceutical products remains highly uncertain because the majority of compounds discovered do not enter clinical studies and the majority of therapeutic candidates fail to show the human safety and efficacy necessary for regulatory approval and successful commercialization 
in the pharmaceutical business  the research and development process can take up to years  or even longer  from discovery to commercial product launch 
during each stage of this process  there is a substantial risk of failure 
preclinical testing and clinical trials must demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and efficacious 
the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in subsequent clinical trials  and these clinical trials may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy necessary to obtain regulatory approval for any product candidates 
a number of companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after obtaining promising results in earlier trials 
for ethical reasons  certain clinical trials are conducted with patients having the most advanced stages of disease and who have failed treatment with alternative therapies 
during the course of treatment  these patients often die or suffer other adverse medical effects for reasons that may not be related to the pharmaceutical agent being tested 
such events can have a negative impact on the statistical analysis of clinical trial results 
the completion of clinical trials of our product candidates may be delayed by many factors  including the rate of enrollment of patients 
neither we nor our collaborators can control the rate at which patients present themselves for enrollment  and the rate of patient enrollment may not be consistent with our expectations or sufficient to enable clinical trials of our product candidates to be completed in a timely manner or at all 
in addition  we may not be permitted by regulatory authorities to undertake additional clinical trials for one or more of our product candidates 
even if such trials are conducted  our product candidates may not prove to be safe and efficacious or receive regulatory approvals 
any significant delays in  or termination of  clinical trials of our product candidates could impact our ability to generate product sales from these product candidates in the future 
our research and development and marketing efforts are often dependent on corporate collaborators and other third parties who may not devote sufficient time  resources and attention to our programs  which may limit our efforts to develop and market potential products 
because we have limited resources  we have entered into a number of collaboration agreements with other pharmaceutical companies  including h 
lundbeck a s with respect to our research efforts in parkinson s disease  and with a number of marketing partners for our products in certain countries outside the united states 
in some cases  our collaboration agreements call for our partners to control the supply of bulk or formulated drugs for use in clinical trials or for commercial use  the design and execution of clinical studies  the process of obtaining regulatory approval to market the product  and or marketing and selling of an approved product 
in each of these areas  our partners may not support fully our research and commercial interests because our program may compete for time  attention and resources with the internal programs of our corporate collaborators 
as such  our program may not move forward as effectively  or advance as rapidly  as it might if we had retained complete control of all research  development  regulatory and commercialization decisions 
we also rely on some of these collaborators and other third parties for the production of compounds and the manufacture and supply of pharmaceutical products 
additionally  we may find it necessary from time to time to seek new or additional partners to assist us in commercializing our products  though we might not be successful in establishing any such new or additional relationships 
the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile  which may make it difficult for holders to sell our common stock when desired or at attractive prices 
the market price of our common stock is highly volatile  and we expect it to continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future 
for example  from january  through december  our common stock traded at a high price of and a low price of 
negative announcements  including  among others adverse regulatory decisions  disappointing clinical trial results  disputes and other developments concerning patent or other proprietary rights with respect to our products  or sales or operating results that fall below the market s expectations could trigger significant declines in the price of our common stock 
in addition  external events  such as news concerning economic conditions  our competitors or our customers  changes in government regulations impacting the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industries or the movement of capital into or out of our industry  also are likely to affect the price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
a portion of our revenues and expenses is subject to exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of business  which could adversely affect our reported results of operations 
historically  a portion of our revenues and expenses has been earned and incurred  respectively  in currencies other than the us dollar 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenues were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we translate revenues earned and expenses incurred into us dollars at the average exchange rate applicable during the relevant period 
a weakening of the us dollar would  therefore  increase both our revenues and expenses 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the euro and other currencies may affect period to period comparisons of our operating results 
historically  we have not hedged our exposure to these fluctuations in exchange rates 
we are involved  or may become involved in the future  in legal proceedings that  if adversely adjudicated or settled  could materially impact our financial condition 
as a biopharmaceutical company  we are or may become a party to litigation in the ordinary course of our business  including  among others  matters alleging employment discrimination  product liability  patent or other intellectual property rights infringement  patent invalidity or breach of commercial contract 
in general  litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact results of operations and financial condition 
we currently are vigorously defending ourselves against certain litigation matters 
while we currently do not believe that the settlement or adverse adjudication of these lawsuits would materially impact our results of operations or financial condition  the final resolution of these matters and the impact  if any  on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be material 
our dependence on key executives and scientists could impact the development and management of our business 
we are highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  and we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development and management of our business 
although we do not believe the loss of one individual would materially harm our business  our business might be harmed by the loss of the services of multiple existing personnel  as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific  technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner 
much of the know how we have developed resides in our scientific and technical personnel and is not readily transferable to other personnel 
while we have employment agreements with our key executives  we do not ordinarily enter into employment agreements with our other key scientific  technical and managerial employees 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our employees 
we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations  and our related compliance may limit any future profitability 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous  infectious and radioactive materials that could be hazardous to human health and safety or the environment 
we store these materials  and various wastes resulting from their use  at our facilities pending ultimate use and disposal 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  generation  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and wastes  and we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with related existing and future environmental laws and regulations 
while we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials 
in the event of an accident  we could be held liable for any resulting damages  which could include fines and remedial costs 
these damages could require payment by us of significant amounts over a number of years  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
anti takeover provisions may delay or prevent changes in control of our management or deter a third party from acquiring us  limiting our stockholders ability to profit from such a transaction 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  par value  of which  have been reserved for issuance in connection with our stockholder rights plan  and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
our stockholder rights plan could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person becomes an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
the application of section could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of cephalon 
section  the rights plan  and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware corporate law  may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers  or delaying or preventing changes in control of our management  including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to our operations in european subsidiaries that have transactions  assets  and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting purposes 
historically  we have not hedged any of these foreign currency exchange risks 
for the year ended december   an average weakening of the us dollar relative to the currencies in which our european subsidiaries operate would have resulted in an increase of million in reported total revenues and a corresponding increase in reported expenses 
this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not assume any changes in the level of operations of our european subsidiaries 
in january  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution  relating to our million convertible subordinated notes  in the aggregate notional amount of million 
we pay interest under the swap based on the month libor bba rate plus basis points  adjusted quarterly 
at inception  we recognized a premium on the value of the bonds of million that we will amortize and recognize as interest expense over the remaining term of the notes 
we also recognize adjustments to interest expense based on changes in the fair values of the bonds and the swap agreement each quarter 
if libor increases or decreases by basis points  our annual interest expense would change by million 
changes in interest rates and the price and volatility of our common stock would also affect the fair values of the notes and the swap agreement  resulting in adjustments to interest expense 
in january  we entered into a foreign exchange contract to protect against fluctuations in the australian dollar against the us dollar related to our unsuccessful bid for sirtex medical limited 
we terminated this contract in the second quarter of except for the interest rate swap agreement described above  our exposure to market risk for a change in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio  since all of our outstanding debt is fixed rate 
our investments are classified as short term and as available for sale 
we do not believe that short term fluctuations in interest rates would materially affect the value of our securities
