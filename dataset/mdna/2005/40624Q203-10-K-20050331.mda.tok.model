item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of the company s financial condition and the results of its operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report 
management overview the company s business involves marketing and underwriting of non standard personal automobile insurance in texas  new mexico and arizona  marketing commercial insurance in texas  new mexico  idaho  oregon and washington  affiliate and third party claims administration  and other insurance related services 
the company pursues its business activities through subsidiaries organized into a personal lines group  which handles non standard personal automobile insurance  and a commercial lines group  which handles commercial insurance 
for the year ended december   the company reported income before extraordinary gain of million  representing a increase over the million reported for the prior year 
the company reported net income of million for the year ended december   compared with net income of million for  which included an million extraordinary gain related to the acquisition of a new personal lines group subsidiary 
on a diluted per share basis  net income was for the year ended december   compared with net income of per diluted share in the decrease in net income per diluted share was primarily attributable to the combined impact of the million extraordinary gain in and an increase in the weighted average shares outstanding to million diluted shares during  compared to million diluted shares during  primarily as a result of a successful shareholder rights offering completed in the third quarter of the increased operating earnings in reflect benefits achieved from the integration of recent acquisitions  ongoing initiatives to improve underwriting performance and sustained favorable market conditions 
both the personal lines group and the commercial lines group contributed to the enhanced operating results for the improvement in the personal lines group operating earnings in was primarily driven by better underwriting results 
the improvement in the commercial lines group operating earnings in was driven largely by increased commission revenue attributable to the combination of increased premiums written and favorable underwriting performance 
critical accounting estimates and judgments the company s significant accounting policies requiring management estimates and judgments are discussed below 
such estimates and judgments are based on historical experience  changes in laws and regulations  observance of industry trends and information received from third parties 
while the estimates and judgments associated with the application of these accounting policies may be affected by different assumptions or conditions  the company believes the estimates and judgments associated with the reported consolidated financial statement amounts are appropriate in the circumstances 
for additional discussion of the company s accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
investments 
the company completes a detailed analysis each quarter to assess whether the decline in the fair value of any investment below cost is deemed other than temporary 
all securities with an unrealized loss are reviewed 
unless other factors cause us to reach a contrary conclusion  investments with a fair market value less than cost for more than days are deemed to have a decline in value that is other than temporary 
a decline in value that is considered to be other than temporary is charged to earnings based on the fair value of the security at the time of assessment  resulting in a new cost basis for the security 
risks and uncertainties are inherent in the company s other than temporary decline in value assessment methodology 
risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  incorrect or overly optimistic assumptions about financial condition or liquidity  incorrect or overly optimistic assumptions about future prospects  unfavorable changes in economic or social conditions and unfavorable changes in interest rates or credit ratings 
deferred policy acquisition costs 
policy acquisition costs mainly commission  underwriting and marketing expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new and renewal business are deferred and charged to operations over periods in which the related premiums are earned 
ceding commissions from reinsurers  which include expense allowances  are deferred and recognized over the period premiums are earned for the underlying policies reinsured 
the method followed in computing deferred policy acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to their estimated realizable value 
a premium deficiency exists if the sum of expected claim costs and claim adjustment expenses  unamortized acquisition costs  and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and expected investment income on those unearned premiums  as computed on a product line basis 
the company routinely evaluates the realizability of deferred policy acquisition costs 
at december  and  there was no premium deficiency related to deferred policy acquisition costs 
goodwill 
the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes goodwill of acquired businesses of approximately million 
this amount has been recorded as a result of prior business acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
under sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which the company adopted as of january   goodwill is tested for impairment annually 
the company completed its annual test for impairment during the fourth quarter of and determined that there was no indication of impairment 
a significant amount of judgment is required in performing goodwill impairment tests 
such tests include estimating the fair value of the company s reporting units 
as required by sfas  the company compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
under statement no 
 fair value refers to the amount for which the entire reporting unit may be bought or sold 
methods for estimating reporting unit values include market quotations  asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flows and multiples of earnings or revenues 
with the exception of market quotations  all of these methods involve significant estimates and assumptions 
deferred tax assets 
the company files a consolidated federal income tax return 
deferred federal income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end 
deferred taxes are recognized using the liability method  whereby tax rates are applied to cumulative temporary differences based on when and how they are expected to affect the tax return 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for tax rate changes 
a valuation allowance is provided against the company s deferred tax asset to the extent that management does not believe it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be adequate to realize these future tax benefits 
this valuation allowance was  at december  and this valuation allowance was necessary due to the limitation imposed by section of the internal revenue code on utilizing the net operating loss acquired as part of the phoenix acquisition 
reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
reserves for unpaid losses and lae are established by the company for claims which have already been incurred by the policyholder but which have not been paid by the company 
losses and lae represent the estimated ultimate net cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through december  and the reserves for unpaid losses and lae are estimated using individual case basis valuations and statistical analyses 
these estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency 
see  item business analysis of hallmark s losses and lae and analysis of loss and lae reserve 
although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  management believes that the reserves for unpaid losses and lae are adequate 
due to the inherent uncertainty in estimating unpaid losses and lae  the actual ultimate amounts may differ from the recorded amounts 
a small percentage change could result in a material effect on reported earnings 
for example  a change in december  unpaid losses and lae would produce a thousand change to pre tax earnings 
the estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known 
such adjustments are included in current operations 
the range of unpaid losses and lae estimated by the company s actuaries as of december  was million to million 
management s best estimate of unpaid losses and lae as of december  is million 
in setting this estimate of unpaid losses and lae  management has assumed  among other things  that current trends in loss frequency and severity will continue and that the actuarial analysis was empirically valid 
in the absence of any specific factors indicating actual experience at either extreme of the actuarial range  management has established a best estimate of unpaid losses and lae  which is approximately million higher than the midpoint of the actuarial range 
the actuarial range is determined independently of management s best estimate and is only used to check the reasonableness of that estimate 
it would be expected that management s best estimate would move within the actuarial range from year to year due to changes in the company s operations and changes within the marketplace 
the company s reserve requirements are also interrelated with product pricing and profitability 
the company must price its products at a level sufficient to fund its policyholder benefits and still remain profitable 
because the company s claim expenses represent the single largest category of its expenses  inaccuracies in the assumptions used to estimate the amount of such benefits can result in the company failing to price its products appropriately and to generate sufficient premiums to fund its operations 
ceding commissions of the personal lines group 
under hallmark s reinsurance arrangements prior to october   the company earned ceding commissions based on dorinco s loss ratio ultimate losses and loss expenses incurred to earned premium experience on the portion of policies reinsured by dorinco 
the company received a provisional commission as policies were produced as an advance against the later determination of the commission actually earned 
the ceding commission is an estimate that varies with the estimated loss ratio and is sensitive to changes in that estimate 
the provisional commission is adjusted periodically on a sliding scale based on expected loss ratios 
the following table details the ceding commission sensitivity to the actual ultimate loss ratio for each effective quota share treaty with dorinco at above and below the provisional loss ratio 
treaty effective dates provisional loss ratio ultimate loss ratio booked at effect of actual above provisional       effect of actual below provisional       recognition of profit sharing commission revenues of the commercial lines group 
profit sharing commission of the commercial lines group is calculated and recognized when the loss ratio  as determined by a qualified actuary  deviates from contractual thresholds 
the profit sharing commission is an estimate that varies with the estimated loss ratio and is sensitive to changes in that estimate 
the following table details the profit sharing commission revenue sensitivity to the actual ultimate loss ratio for each effective quota share treaty at above and below the provisional loss ratio 
treaty effective dates provisional loss ratio ultimate loss ratio booked to at effect of actual above provisional     effect of actual below provisional     liquidity and capital resources the company s sources of funds are principally derived from insurance related operations 
the major sources of funds from operations include premiums collected net of policy cancellations and premiums ceded  ceding commissions  and processing and service fees 
other sources of funds are from financing and investment activities 
on a consolidated basis  the company s cash and investments increased approximately as of december  as compared to december  this was primarily a result of improved underwriting results and increased commercial premium volume in the company s consolidated cash  cash equivalents and investments at december  and were million and million  respectively 
these amounts exclude restricted cash and investments of million and million  respectively  which primarily secures the credit exposure of oacm and state county on their quota share reinsurance treaties with hallmark 
the company s operating activities provided million in net cash during as compared to million in the company collected million more in ceding commissions in as a result of increased commission premium volume  paid million less in loss and lae  net of reinsurance  as a result of improved underwriting performance  and paid million less in interest as a result of repaying a related party promissory note in these cash flow improvements were partially offset by a million reduction in other income collected due to the sale of the company s retail agencies in the first quarter of cash used in investing activities during was million compared to cash provided by investing activities of million in premium finance notes repaid over notes originated decreased by million in over due to the discontinuation of the premium finance program in during  the company received million in cash from the acquisition of phoenix 
during  the company purchased million more in investment securities than it redeemed whereas in the company purchased million more in investment securities that it redeemed 
the company also transferred million less from cash and investments to restricted trust accounts in than in these restricted trust accounts are established to secure the credit exposure of oacm and state county from their quota share reinsurance treaties with hallmark 
cash used in financing activities decreased by million during as compared to primarily due to the discontinuation of the company s premium finance program in the company had net repayments to the premium finance lender of million in which paid off all outstanding advances 
also contributing to the decrease in cash used in financing activities in was the repayment of an million promissory note to a related party in from million in proceeds from a rights offering the company completed in the third quarter of hfs is dependent on dividend payments and management fees from its insurance company operations and free cash flow of its non insurance companies to meet operating expenses and debt obligations

during  hallmark paid million in dividends to hfs that were declared in based on surplus at december   hallmark could pay up to million in dividends to hfs during without tdi approval 
phoenix  domiciled in arizona  is limited in the payment of dividends to the lesser of of prior year policyholder surplus or prior year s net investment income  without prior written approval from the azdoi 
during  phoenix s ordinary dividend capacity was million 
in order to strengthen policyholder surplus  phoenix did not declare any dividends in the maximum dividend that phoenix can pay hfs in without prior approval of the azdoi is million 
tdi regulates financial transactions between hallmark  hfs and affiliated companies 
applicable regulations require tdi s approval of management and expense sharing contracts and similar transactions 
although tdi has approved hallmark s payment of management fees to hfs and commissions to ahga  since the second half of management has elected not to pay all the approved commissions or management fees 
ahga paid management fees of million to hfs during and the azdoi regulates financial transactions between phoenix and affiliated companies 
applicable regulations require azdoi s approval of management and expense sharing contracts and similar transactions 
phoenix paid million in management fees to ahga during and paid no management fees in statutory capital and surplus is calculated as statutory assets less statutory liabilities

as of december   hallmark and phoenix exceeded the minimum required statutory capital and surplus by and  respectively 
at december   hallmark reported statutory capital and surplus of million  which reflects an increase of million from the million reported at december  at december   phoenix reported statutory capital and surplus of million  which is million more than the million reported at december  hallmark reported statutory net income of million during compared to million in phoenix reported statutory net income of million during compared to a statutory net loss of million in at december   hallmark s premium to surplus percentage was as compared to for the year ended december  phoenix s premium to surplus percentage was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  information regarding the company s contractual obligations under operating leases as of december  is incorporated by reference to note of the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
based on budgeted and year to date cash flow information  the company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its projected insurance obligations  operational expenses and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  management is pursuing opportunities for future growth  and additional capital may be required to fund further expansion of the company 
results of operations fiscal versus fiscal total revenues for decreased million  or  as compared to  primarily as a result of a million decline in total revenues from the personal lines group partially offset by a million increase in total revenues from the commercial lines group 
however  income before tax and extraordinary gain for increased million as compared to the improvement in operating earnings in reflects better underwriting results for the personal lines group  additional commission revenue in the commercial lines group and an overall reduction in interest expense as a result of the repayment of a related party note in september the following is additional business segment information for the twelve months ended december  and in thousands revenues personal lines group   commercial lines group   corporate consolidated   pre tax income personal lines group   commercial lines group   corporate   consolidated  personal lines group net premiums written decreased million  or during to million compared to million in the decrease in net premiums written was primarily attributable to the cancellation of unprofitable agents and programs  a shift in marketing focus from annual term premium financed policies to six month term direct bill policies  a reduction in policy counts caused by targeted rate adjustments and increased competition from newly capitalized entities entering the marketplace 
net premiums earned decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in primarily as a result of the decline in net premiums earned  total revenue for the personal lines group decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in although revenue for the personal lines group declined  its pre tax income increased million  or  to million in as compared to million in the increase in pre tax income was primarily due to improved underwriting results  as evidenced by a loss and lae ratio of for as compared to for also contributing to the improved pre tax results were reduced salary and related expenses of million due to the successful integration of the phoenix operations in late and the overall reduction in premium volume and increased net investment income of million 
these improvements were partially offset by the discontinuation of the premium finance program which caused finance charge revenue to decrease by million which was partially offset by reduced interest expense of million 
commercial lines group total revenue for the commercial lines group of million for was million  or  more than the million reported for the improvement was primarily due to a million increase in commission revenue and a million increase in claim servicing revenue 
commercial premium volume growth was the primary cause of the increased commission and claim fee revenue for earned premium generated by the commercial lines group for was million compared to million for the company does not bear the primary underwriting risk for this business and  therefore  the resulting premiums and claims are not reflected in the company s reported results 
pre tax income for the commercial lines group of million in increased million  or  over the million reported in increased revenue  as discussed above  was the primary reason for the increase in pre tax income  partially offset by additional compensation and production related costs of million attributable to the increased premium volume 
corporate corporate pre tax loss was million for as compared to million for the company saved million in interest expense in due to the repayment of a related party note in september this was partially offset by a million increase in salary and related expenses in fiscal versus fiscal income before tax  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and extraordinary gain was million for  compared to  in the improvement in operating earnings in reflected better underwriting results for hallmark and the acquisition of the commercial lines group in december  partially offset by the acquisition of phoenix

the gain was calculated as the difference between the fair value of the net assets of phoenix of million and the million cost of the note receivable from millers 
the following is additional business segment information for the twelve months ended december  and in thousands revenues personal lines group   commercial lines group   corporate consolidated   pre tax income personal lines group   commercial lines group  corporate   consolidated personal lines group gross premiums written prior to reinsurance for decreased and net premiums written after reinsurance increased in relation to the decrease in gross premiums written is primarily due to the change in the reinsurance structure with dorinco and the county mutual fronting companies state county and oacm 
effective april   the company assumed a share of the non standard auto business produced by ahga and underwritten by either state county or oacm instead of the share it assumed prior to that date 
also  effective april   dorinco assumed its share of this business directly  where prior to this date the company retroceded of the business to dorinco 
the decrease in gross premiums written was also impacted by hallmark s cancellation of unprofitable agents  shift in marketing focus from annual term premium financed policies to six month term direct bill policies and increases in policy rates 
these decreases were partially offset by the acquisition of phoenix in  which contributed million in gross premiums written 
the increase in net premiums written is due primarily to the acquisition of phoenix in  which contributed million in net premiums written 
revenue for the personal lines group increased in to million from million in the increase is due mostly to the acquisition of phoenix  which contributed million in revenue in and ahga commission revenue of million from dorinco on policies effective after march  due to the revised reinsurance structure 
pre tax income for the personal lines group increased million in to million as compared to million in improved pricing in and hallmark s termination of unprofitable agents in the first quarter of helped improve underwriting results excluding phoenix as evidenced by a loss ratio of in as compared to in partially offsetting this improvement was increased salary and related expenses excluding phoenix of million  the discontinuation of the premium finance program which reduced finance charge revenue by million  partially offset by reduced interest expense of million  and the acquisition of phoenix in which reported a million pre tax loss 
the results for phoenix included a loss accrual of million  net of applicable reinsurance  for the settlement of a bad faith claim 
commercial lines group revenue for the commercial lines group of million in was mostly comprised of million of commissions earned on policies serviced by hga for cnic 
revenue also included million of processing and service fees earned by ecm for claims processing for cnic and by far for accounting administration for an unaffiliated third party  the contract for which ended in april the commercial lines group reported revenue of million for the one month ended december   which was mostly comprised of million of commissions and million of processing and service fees 
these were new sources of revenue for the company as a result of the acquisition of the commercial lines group in december pre tax income for the commercial lines group of million in was comprised of million in revenue as discussed above and million in other operating costs and expenses 
these costs primarily represented expenses associated with the production and servicing of insurance policies for cnic  the largest component of which was independent retail agent commissions 
corporate corporate pre tax loss of million in increased million as compared to million for other operating costs and expenses increased million mostly as a result of legal and consulting fees associated with acquisitions and other corporate matters 
additionally  the shift in management structure from to increased salary related expenses and other overhead during interest expense was increased by million in due to interest on a related party note payable

effects of inflation management does not believe that inflation has a material effect on the company s results of operations  except for the effect that inflation may have on interest rates and claim costs 
the effects of inflation are considered in pricing and estimating reserves for unpaid losses and lae 
the actual effects of inflation on results of operations are not known until claims are ultimately settled 
in addition to general price inflation  the company is exposed to the upward trend in the cost of judicial awards for damages 
the company attempts to mitigate the effects of inflation in the pricing of policies and establishing loss and lae reserves 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management believes that interest rate risk  credit risk and equity price risk are the types of market risk to which the company is principally exposed 
interest rate risk the company s investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade  fixed income securities  all of which are classified as available for sale 
accordingly  the primary market risk exposure to these securities is interest rate risk 
in general  the fair market value of a portfolio of fixed income securities increases or decreases inversely with changes in market interest rates  while net investment income realized from future investments in fixed income securities increases or decreases along with interest rates 
the fair value of the company s fixed income securities as of december  was million 
the effective duration of the portfolio as of december  was years 
should the market interest rates increase  the company s fixed income investment portfolio would be expected to decline in market value by  or million  representing the effective duration multiplied by the change in market interest rates 
conversely  a decline in interest rates would be expected to result in a  or million  increase in the market value of the fixed income investment portfolio 
credit risk an additional exposure to the company s fixed income securities portfolio is credit risk 
management attempts to manage the credit risk by investing only in investment grade securities and limiting the company s exposure to a single issuer 
as of december   the company s fixed income investments were invested in the following municipal securities  corporate securities  us treasury securities  and mortgage backed securities 
as of december   all of the company s fixed income securities were rated investment grade by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
the company is also subject to credit risk with respect to reinsurers to whom it has ceded underwriting risk 
although a reinsurer is liable for losses to the extent of the coverage it assumes  the company remains obligated to its policyholders in the event that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements 
in order to mitigate credit risk to reinsurance companies  the company has used financially strong reinsurers with an am best rating of a or better 
the company discontinued ceding underwriting risk to reinsurers effective april  equity price risk investments in equity securities which are subject to equity price risk make up of the company s portfolio 
the carrying values of equity securities are based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet date 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer  the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold 
the fair value of the company s equity securities as of december  was million 
the fair value of the company s equity securities would increase or decrease by million assuming a hypothetical increase or decrease in market prices as of the balance sheet date 
this would increase or decrease shareholders equity by 
the selected hypothetical change does not reflect what should be considered the best or worse case scenario
