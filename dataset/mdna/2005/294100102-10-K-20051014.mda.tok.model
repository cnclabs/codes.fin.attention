item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
see forward looking and cautionary statements 
because of the foregoing factors  you should not rely on past financial results as an indication of future performance 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results to date are not necessarily meaningful and expect that our results of operations might fluctuate from period to period in the future 
enzo biochem  inc the company or enzo is a leading life sciences and biotechnology company focused on harnessing genetic processes to develop research tools  diagnostics and therapeutics 
enzo also provides clinical laboratory services to the medical community 
in addition  our work in gene analysis has led to our development of significant therapeutic product candidates  several of which are currently in clinical trials  and several are in preclinical studies 
the business activities of the company are performed by the company s three wholly owned subsidiaries 
these activities are research and development  manufacturing and marketing of biomedical research products and tools through enzo life sciences and research and development of therapeutic products through enzo therapeutics  and the operation of a clinical reference laboratory through enzo clinical labs 
for information relating to the company s business segments  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s source of revenue has been from the direct sales of research products consisting of labeling and detection reagents for the genomics and sequencing markets  as well as through non exclusive distribution agreements with other companies 
another source of revenue has been from the clinical laboratory service market 
payments for clinical laboratory testing services are made by the medicare program  healthcare insurers and patients 
fees billed to patients  medicare  and third party payers are billed on the laboratory s standard gross fee schedule  subject to any limitations on fees negotiated with the third party payers or with the ordering physicians on behalf of their patients 
the company incurs additional costs as a result of our participation in the medicare programs  as billing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing is subject to considerable and complex federal regulations 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations  as well as internal compliance policies and procedures  adds further complexity and costs to our operations 
government payers such as medicare  as well as healthcare insurers have taken steps and may continue to take steps to control the costs  utilizations and delivery of healthcare services  including clinical laboratory services 
principally as a result of reimbursement reductions and measures adopted by the centers for medicare medicaid services  or cms  which establishes procedures and continuously evaluates and implements changes in the reimbursement process to control utilization  despite the added cost and complexity of participating in the medicare program  we continue to participate because we believe that our other business may depend  in part  on continued participation in medicare since certain ordering physicians may want a single laboratory capable of performing all of their clinical laboratory testing services  regardless of who pays for such services 
information systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of the clinical laboratory operations  including testing  billing  customer service  logistics  and management of medical data 
our success depends  in part  on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems 
through maintenance  staffing  and investments in our information technology system  we expect to reduce the risk associated with our heavy reliance on these systems the clinical laboratory is subject to seasonal fluctuations in operating results and cash flows 
typically  testing volume declines during the summer months  year end holiday periods and other major holidays  reducing net revenues and operating cash flows 
testing volume is also subject to declines in winter months due to inclement weather  which varies in severity from year to year 
for the fiscal years ended july  and  respectively  approximately and percent of the company s operating revenues were derived from research product sales and approximately and were derived from clinical laboratory services

under the terms of the agreement  the company received an initial payment of million  would earn in the first annual period october  to september  a minimum royalty payment of million  and receive a minimum royalty of million in each of the next four annual periods 
in addition  the agreement provides for the company to receive quarterly running royalties on the net sales of digene products subject to the license until the expiration of the patent on april  these quarterly running royalties will be fully creditable against the minimum royalty payments due in the first five years of the agreement 
the balance  if any  of the minimum royalty payment will be recognized in the final quarter of the applicable annual royalty period 
liquidity and capital resources at july   our cash and cash equivalents of million and marketable securities of million together totaled million  an increase of million from july  we had working capital of million at july  compared to million at july  as a result of the digene agreement  the company recorded a gain on patent litigation settlement of million in the first quarter of fiscal  and deferred million which would be earned from net sales of the company s licensed products covered by the agreement during the first annual period 
as of july   the balance of the deferred revenue from the settlement was  see legal proceedings 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended july  was approximately million as compared to net cash used by operating activities of million for the year ended july  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal of million was primarily due to fiscal s net income  which includes the gain from the digene agreement  and by the net change in operating assets and liabilities compared to the prior year  which includes the receipt of the income tax receivable amount of million 
in fiscal  net cash provided by investing activities increased approximately million from fiscal  primarily due to sales of marketable securities 
in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities decreased approximately million from fiscal primarily as a result of the decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
net accounts receivable of million and million represented days and days of operating revenues at july  and  respectively 
the change in net accounts receivable is due to a decrease in accounts receivable at the clinical laboratory of approximately million and a decrease of research products accounts receivable of approximately million 
the decrease in the clinical laboratory receivable is primarily due to improvements in the collection process 
the decrease in the research products accounts receivable is primarily due to the decrease in revenues from distributors of research products 
net accounts receivable from our clinical laboratory operations of million and million represented an average of days and days of clinical laboratory services revenues at july  and  respectively 
the company has entered into various real estate and equipment leases 
the real estate lease for the company s farmingdale headquarters is with a related party 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of these various leases 
the following is a summary of future payments under the company s contractual obligations as of july  payments due by period less than total year years years over years real estate and equipment leases      total contractual cash obligations      we believe that our current cash position is sufficient for our foreseeable liquidity and capital resource needs  although there can be no assurance that future events will not alter such view 
management is not aware of any material claims  disputes or settled matters concerning third party reimbursements that would have a material effect on our financial statements 
critical accounting policies general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon enzo biochem  inc consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  these estimates and judgments also affect related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to contractual allowance  allowance for uncollectible accounts  intangible assets and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition research product revenues revenues from research product sales  exclusive of certain non exclusive distribution agreements  are recognized when the products are shipped  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company has certain non exclusive distribution agreements  which provide for consideration to be paid to the distributors for the manufacture of certain products 
the company records such consideration provided to distributors under these non exclusive distribution agreements as a reduction to research product revenues 
the revenue from these non exclusive distribution agreements are recognized when shipments are made to their respective customers and reported to the company 
clinical laboratory services revenues from the clinical laboratory are recognized upon completion of the testing process for a specific patient and reported to the ordering physician 
the company s revenue is based on gross amounts billed or billable for services rendered  net of estimated contractual adjustments and other arrangements made with third party payers to provide services at less than established billing rates 
our accounting system does not record contractual adjustments at the time of billing 
instead  contractual adjustments  and the provision for doubtful accounts  are estimated based on historical collection experience using a retrospective collection analysis and aging models 
the following is a table of the clinical laboratory segment s gross billing percentages by billing category fiscal year fiscal year gross july  july  billing category to total to total medicare third party carriers patient self pay hmo s total contractual allowances medicare regulations and the various third party payers and managed care contracts are often complex and may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms for different types of services provided in our clinical laboratory 
we estimate the allowance for contractual allowances based on our interpretation of the applicable regulations and historical calculations 
the company estimates its contractual allowance based on historical collection experience using a retrospective collection analysis and aging models 
however  the services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are often subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates 
additionally  updated regulations occur frequently necessitating continual review and assessment of the estimation process by management 
the process the company uses to determine its estimate of the contractual allowances for its laboratory services segment is based upon a rolling monthly weighted average of historical reimbursement statistics 
during the fiscal years ended july    and  the contractual allowance percentages  determined using the rolling monthly weighted average historical reimbursement statistics  were   and  respectively 
the company projects by using a sensitivity analysis that each change in the contractual allowance percentage could result in a change in the net accounts receivable of approximately  and  as of july  and  respectively  and a change in clinical laboratory services revenues of approximately   and  for the fiscal years ended july    and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company utilizes a historical collection analysis to establish allowances for doubtful accounts for each receivable category  which considers the aging of the receivables and results in an increase in the allowances as the aging of the related receivables increases 
the company believes collection of receivables from self payers is subject to credit risk and the patient s ability to pay 
the allowance for doubtful accounts also includes the uncollectible balances from third party payers for the insufficient diagnosis information received from the ordering physician  which result in denials of payment 
in addition  the allowance is increased when a receivable from a third party or hmo remains open due to a denial of coverage based upon the provider relationships 
the company reserved for or wrote off of all accounts receivable for all payers over days during fiscal as it assumed all these accounts are uncollectible 
the written off amounts are kept on the aging for patient billing and demographic information 
the company also set up reserves for accounts under days in fiscal the company adjusts the estimate for any recoveries on an ongoing basis through the historical collection analysis 
the company s ability to collect outstanding receivables from third party payers is critical to its operating performance and cash flows 
the primary collection risk lies with uninsured patients or patients for whom primary insurance has paid but a patient portion remains outstanding 
the company estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based upon the age of the accounts since invoice date 
the company continually monitors its accounts receivable balances and utilizes cash collections data to support the basis for its estimates of the provision for doubtful accounts 
significant changes in payer mix or regulations could have a significant impact on the company s results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  the company has implemented a process to estimate and review the collectibles of its receivables based on the period they have been outstanding 
historical collection and payer reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to reserves for doubtful accounts 
the company also assesses the current state of its billing functions in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement issues in order to assess the impact  if any  on the reserve estimates  which involves judgment 
the company believes that the collectibility of its receivables is directly linked to the quality of its billing processes  most notably  those related to obtaining the correct information in order to bill effectively for the services provided 
revisions in reserve for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense 
the company believes that its collection and reserves processes  along with the close monitoring of its billing processes  helps reduce the risk associated with material revisions to reserve estimates resulting from adverse changes in collection and reimbursement experience and billing operations 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
the liability method requires that any tax benefits recognized for net operating loss carry forwards and other items be reduced by a valuation allowance where it is more likely than not the benefits may not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
under the liability method  the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date

the decrease was primarily due to the company not recording revenue due to the ongoing dispute with certain distributors on the sales of certain licensed products  partially offset by the increase in direct sales of our research products and royalty income from digene 
the decline in the gross profit margin on research product sales and royalties in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to the decline in revenues from distributors with whom we had supply agreements 
revenues from these distributors were net of manufacturing costs 
see legal proceedings 
fiscal clinical laboratory revenues were million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million or  primarily due to the increase in the number of customer accounts being serviced 
this increase in new customer accounts is due to the expansion into the new jersey and westchester market that commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal the cost of research products revenues in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million or  primarily due to lower royalty costs because of the expiration of a licensed patent agreement with yale university 
the cost of clinical laboratory services in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million or  primarily due to the increased number of tests performed and higher costs incurred to perform certain esoteric tests 
the increase in tests performed is due to the new accounts being serviced through the expansion into new jersey markets 
fiscal research and development expenses were million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million or primarily due to increases in clinical trial study costs for the development of therapeutic products 
fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in direct selling expenditures for our clinical reference laboratory and life science divisions  an increase in information technology costs for the expansion of the information technology connectivity system and data center personnel costs including infrastructure expenses and accounting related fees for the compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of fiscal provision for uncollectible accounts receivable in the clinical reference laboratory segment was million  compared to million during the same period in  a decrease of million or 
the percentage of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable as a proportion of clinical laboratory services revenues decreased to in fiscal compared to for the period 
this decrease was primarily due to improved collection procedures and due to the change in the mix of the demographics of the patients from the new jersey new customer accounts 
fiscal legal expenses were million compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million or 
the decrease is primarily due to the reduction of legal activities because of the settlement with digene corporation during fiscal s first quarter ended october  fiscal interest income increased million or to million compared to million during fiscal  due to the increased amount of cash available for investment and the increase in interest rates offered on debt securities 
the company earns interest on its cash and cash equivalents by investing primarily in short term days or less diverse financial instruments with high credit ratings 
on october   the company as plaintiff finalized and executed a settlement and license agreement with digene corporation to settle a patent litigation lawsuit the digene agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  the company received an initial payment of million  would earn in the first annual period october  to september  a minimum royalty payment of million  and receive a minimum royalty of million in each of the next four annual periods 
in addition  the agreement provides for the company to receive quarterly running royalties on the net sales of digene products subject to the license until the expiration of the patent on april  these quarterly running royalties will be fully creditable against the minimum royalty payments due in the first five years of the agreement

the research and development segment s fiscal income before income taxes was million compared to a loss of million in fiscal the fiscal increase resulted from the million gain and related earned royalties from the digene agreement 
the gain was partially offset by a decline in research product revenues due to the ongoing dispute with certain distributors on the sales of certain licensed products 
the clinical reference laboratory segment s income before income taxes was million versus a loss of million 
the increase is due to higher revenues  due to the increase in the number of customer accounts being serviced  and a lower provision for uncollectible accounts  due to the change in the mix of payers and the expansion into the new jersey markets 
the other segment s loss before income taxes was million versus million in fiscal  primarily due to accounting related fees for compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of not incurred in the period 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues from operations for the fiscal year ended july  were million a decrease of million over revenues from operations for the fiscal year ended july  this decrease was due to a decrease of million in revenues from our research product sales operations and decrease of 
million in revenues from clinical reference laboratory operation over revenues for such activities in fiscal the decrease in research product sales resulted primarily from a decrease in direct sales of research products of labeling and detection reagents for the genomics and sequencing markets related to shipments to affymetrix  a major distributor 
research product revenue from this one major distributor accounted for approximately and of the company s total research product revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
see item legal proceedings 
the decrease of clinical laboratory services revenue was due primarily to the recent downward trends that had indicated a decrease in the reimbursements rates from the medicare program  certain third party payers and hmo s 
clinical laboratory services are provided to patients covered by various third party payer programs  including medicare and health maintenance organizations hmo s 
billings for services are included in revenue net of allowances for contractual discounts and allowances paid for differences between the amounts billed and the estimated amount to be paid 
the effect of such reduced reimbursement rates have been reflected in fiscal the clinical laboratory is subject to seasonal fluctuations in operating results 
volume of testing generally declines during the summer months  the year end holiday periods and other major holidays 
in addition  volume declines due to inclement weather may reduce net revenues 
therefore  comparison of the results of successive quarters may not accurately reflect trends or results for the full year 
the cost of research products sold decreased by million from the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in research product revenue based on the termination of a contract with one major distributor 
the cost of clinical laboratory services increased by million during this period primarily due to an increase in costs with certain esoteric tests and costs related to performing more testing in house 
research and development expenses decreased by approximately million as a result of a decrease in the expenses related to the clinical trial activities and other research projects 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million during this fiscal year  as compared to the prior year s fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in both the sales personnel and marketing expenditures for research product sales and clinical laboratory services  an increase at the clinical lab in the information technology expenditures  and an increase in the in house legal patent costs the company s provision for uncollectible accounts receivable increased by million to million from million as compared to last year 
at the clinical laboratory division the percentage of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable as a relationship to revenue increased to this fiscal year as compared to for last year 
these increases were primarily due to the change in the mix of payers during the current fiscal year 
the company wrote off million of an uncollectible receivable from one of its distributors at the life science division this fiscal year 
see item legal proceedings 
the company s legal expenses increased by million to million from million as compared to the previous year 
this increase is primarily due to the increase in patent infringement proceedings and the increase in the overall legal activities on these infringement proceedings 
interest income was comparable to the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal  we recorded a benefit for income taxes of million  based upon an million loss before benefit for taxes on income in the current year as compared to a provision for income taxes of million in fiscal  which were based on the combined effective federal  state and local income tax rates 
net accounts receivable from our clinical laboratory operations of million and million represented an average of days and days of operating revenues at july  and  respectively 
loss before provision for taxes on income from the research and development segment activities and related costs was million in fiscal  as compared to income before provision for taxes on income of million in fiscal the decrease in the profit resulted primarily from a decrease in direct sales of research products of labeling and detection reagents for the genomics and sequencing markets to affymetrix a major distributor 
loss before provision for taxes on income from the clinical reference laboratories segment amounted to a million for fiscal  as compared to income of million for fiscal the decrease in income before taxes for the clinical laboratory segment was primarily due to the reduction in reimbursement rates from third party payers 
loss before provision for taxes on income at the other segment amounted to a loss of million for fiscal  as compared to a loss of million for fiscal  due to the increase in legal expenses in fiscal the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements as such term is defined in item a of regulation s k
