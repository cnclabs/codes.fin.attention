results of operations overall  results for show considerable improvement compared with the results posted for revenues within the fastener segment improved significantly 
however  only a portion of the increase was due to higher unit volume 
the largest portion of the revenue increase reflects recovery of higher raw material costs 
our success within the fastener segment was tempered by continuing weakness in demand for products within the assembly equipment segment  where revenues declined compared to the prior year 
compared to within the fastener segment  revenues increased by  or nearly million 
approximately million of this increase represents the recovery of higher material costs related to the increase in the price of steel wire and rod which are our primary raw materials 
the balance of the increase is primarily due to an increase in units shipped 
increases in the price of raw materials consumed in production amounted to  this was partially offset by an increase of  in scrap recovery and purchase discounts 
in addition  perishable tooling expense increased  due to expenses related to the initial production of a number of new parts  while wage and fringe benefit costs increased  these higher costs were partially offset by a  reduction in outside material processing costs  due to a change in product mix  and by savings of  realized by handling the majority of our routine maintenance internally  rather than outsourcing as had previously been the practice 
the net effect of these changes contributed to a  improvement in gross margin for this segment compared with revenues within the assembly equipment segment declined  or  compared to the prior year 
this change was due to lower unit volumes which reflected lower demand for the product in this segment 
despite the reduction in volume  gross margins improved by  compared with factors contributing to this improvement included savings of  in wage and related benefit costs arising from reductions in the workforce undertaken in the fourth quarter of  a reduction of  in material costs  primarily due to reduced volumes  and a reduction in depreciation expense of  as more equipment became fully depreciated 
selling and administrative expenses declined  or  in compared with the largest single factor contributing to this change was a successful appeal of the michigan single business tax paid in four prior years 
the amount of this refund was  reductions in headcount contributed to a net reduction of  in salary and fringe benefit expense 
these savings were partially offset by an increase of  in profit sharing expense related to the increase in pre tax income 
compared to reduced revenues were the dominant factor contributing to reduced margins within the fastener segment during fastener segment revenues declined abruptly late in the first quarter and remained weak for the balance of the year 
for the year  fastener segment revenues declined compared to  totaling a disappointing  reductions in north american production of domestic automobiles and trucks contributed to the weakness in our business as did continuing competitive pressures which contributed to the loss of some business  as we were unable to meet the price concessions demanded by certain customers 
in addition  some high margin parts were lost in connection with design changes that accompanied the new model year 
reductions in manufacturing staff failed to keep pace with the decline in business activity 
given the lower operating volumes in  compared to  labor costs were disproportionately higher by  in addition to labor  related taxes and fringe benefit costs  including employees health insurance  were also disproportionately higher than in by approximately  higher tooling expenses incurred in connection with the initial production of a variety of new parts caused tooling expenditures to be approximately  higher than would have been expected  given the reduction in operating levels 
within the assembly equipment segment  revenues declined compared to as was the case in the fastener segment  lower volumes contributed to significantly reduced operating efficiencies that were manifested in labor and benefit costs which were disproportionately higher than the prior year by approximately  other factors impacting margins within this segment were increases in the cost of raw materials of approximately  offset in part by a  decrease in depreciation expense due to some equipment becoming fully depreciated 
selling and administrative expenses for were below those for a  reduction in profit sharing expense was the largest single factor contributing to the decrease in this expense category  followed by reductions of  in bonus expense  and  in commission expense due to lower sales in the current year 
these reductions were partially offset by a  expense related to an early retirement program and an increase of  in the cost of employee health insurance 
net interest income increased by approximately  during  primarily as a result of lower interest expense related to lower balances on a note payable  which was paid in full in december

outlook for conditions within our markets remain unsettled 
while the manufacturing segment of the economy has shown improvement overall  activity within the automotive sector  which is our major market  has not improved significantly 
published reports indicate that the big three domestic automobile manufacturers  which directly or indirectly represent our primary market  experienced a decline of nearly in production during although we do not anticipate a significant improvement in that market in  we will continue to pursue opportunities within that market 
in addition  we will continue pursuing opportunities that exist related to the north american operations of foreign owned automobile manufacturers 
we believe the size of the market warrants continued efforts to bolster our participation in this market 
activity within the assembly equipment segment continues to be a cause for concern 
demand for our products remains at very low levels  and we have seen little to suggest meaningful improvement in the near term 
to the contrary  activity within the markets we serve is increasingly subject to foreign competition either from foreign owned companies exporting finished products to the us  or indirectly as us based companies outsource their assembly operations to countries with lower manufacturing costs 
this trend obviously also has adverse consequences for the fastener segment  as well 
the factors described above contribute to excess capacity within our industry  which has the effect of limiting our ability to negotiate price relief 
we have had some success recovering higher raw material prices through the implementation of raw material surcharges and  over the past few months  raw material prices have stabilized 
however  we have no assurance that this is anything more than a temporary situation 
any increase in global demand could easily lead to another round of material cost increases and could lead to availability constraints as well 
as a result  we anticipate that margins will remain under pressure for the foreseeable future 
in addition to the operating challenges identified above  we anticipate incurring significant additional costs in connection with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of and related sec rules 
assuring compliance with these new requirements will entail a significant investment of management resources as well as significant monetary expenditures to document and review existing internal controls 
once the documentation phase is completed  there will be ongoing costs in the form of internal and external testing of these controls to assure continued compliance  and there will likely be an associated increase in the costs of the independent audit process 
we will continue to exploit opportunities to reduce costs in all areas 
while we have successfully implemented cost savings measures in the past  and will continue to do so  the incremental savings from future cost reduction initiatives will be more difficult to realize 
our best opportunity to improve bottom line performance rests with our ability to improve top line performance  and we plan to increase our efforts in that regard in the months ahead 
we recognize that the company s success depends upon many factors 
we express our appreciation for the loyalty of our customers  our shareholders and for the dedicated and diligent efforts of our employees who continue to meet the challenges that we face daily 
these are critical elements of our success both past and future
