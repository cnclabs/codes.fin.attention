item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in  we realized significant royalty revenue from sales of xolair 
xolair generated approximately million in us sales in and is being distributed through five specialty pharmacies 
it is currently labeled for treatment of adults and adolescents years of age and above with moderate to severe persistent asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and whose symptoms are inadequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids 
xolair has been shown to decrease the incidence of asthma exacerbations in these patients 
safety and efficacy have not been established in other allergic conditions 
clinical trials to test the safety and efficacy of xolair to treat pediatric asthma patients and peanut allergy patients are under way 
in  we recorded royalty revenue of million from sales of xolair 
under our collaboration agreements with genentech and novartis  we receive royalties on the net sales of xolair and will share in novartis net profits from sales of xolair in the united states 
over the next several years  we expect our principal revenues will be royalties and profit sharing payments relating to sales of xolair 
we have estimated that  after giving effect to payments to our former attorneys  the blended rate of our net royalty and profit sharing receipts will be in the range of to of net worldwide sales of xolair 
during  we initiated a phase clinical trial for our development product  tnx enrollment of this week three arm  double blind  placebo controlled study  was completed as of the date of this report 
we expect to report interim week data from the clinical trial in the fourth quarter of and have begun planning for a phase clinical trial of the product 
we also advanced one investigational product  tnx  into preclinical development in we anticipate filing an investigational new drug application with the fda for tnx for the indication of inflammatory disease by late in addition  we accelerated the advancement of tnx for osteoporosis through the research process by identifying a lead antibody 
we are now in the process of humanizing the antibody and anticipate moving tnx into preclinical proof of concept testing in our development pipeline has three additional investigational therapies in research  and we are evaluating several other compounds 
during  we also made a strategic decision to broaden our research focus to include oncology 
we have in house scientific expertise in oncology and one of our investigational therapies in research has potential as an oncology therapy 
there is also significant potential for oncology research collaborations for us in houston  with several texas medical center institutions nearby 
operationally  we significantly expanded our manufacturing capacity by agreeing in december to assume the long term lease of a biologics manufacturing facility in san diego  california 
biogen idec was the previous tenant under the lease  and we also agreed to acquire manufacturing equipment with a  liter production capacity in the facility from biogen idec  together with documentation  for approximately million 
this transaction is an important step toward our achieving full integration 
we expect the facility will enable us to manufacture clinical material for our current pipeline products and allow for the expansion of our pipeline through in licensing or acquisition opportunities 
it should also give us better control over producing multiple clinical drugs 
the transaction  including assumption of the lease  closed in january critical accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes thereto 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition revenues from development agreements include payments for milestone achievements and sponsored research and development costs 
milestone payments are received under best efforts contracts and are not refundable 
they are recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved and there are no remaining performance obligations 
revenues for sponsored research and development are recognized as revenue as we complete our obligations related to such activities 
any revenue contingent upon future performance is deferred and recognized as the performance is completed 
under our collaboration agreements with genentech and novartis  we receive a royalty on the net sales of xolair worldwide and share in novartis net profits from xolair sales in the united states 
royalty revenue is recorded monthly based on contractual terms and information provided by genentech and novartis 
royalties are reconciled and adjusted if actual results differ from those previously reported to us 
revenues recognized are net of certain milestone and other credits and amounts due to our former attorneys under an arbitration award 
research and development research and development expenses consist of direct costs and indirect overhead costs  including facilities costs  salaries and related benefit costs and material and supply costs 
expenses may also include upfront fees and milestones paid to licensors and collaborative partners 
such amounts are expensed as incurred 
research and development costs also include estimates for clinical trial costs  which are based on patient enrollment and clinical trial progress 
actual costs may differ from estimates 
recent accounting pronouncement in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas revised share based payment 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation using apb and requires such transactions to be recognized as compensation expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values on the date of the grant  with the compensation expense recognized over the period in which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the stock award 
tanox will adopt this statement on july  using a modified prospective application 
as such  the compensation expense recognition provisions will apply to new awards and to any awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after the adoption date 
additionally  for any unvested awards outstanding at the adoption date  we will recognize compensation expense over the remaining vesting period 
we have begun but have not yet completed  evaluating the impact of adopting sfas revised on our results of operations 
we currently determine the fair value of stock based compensation using a black scholes option pricing model 
in connection with evaluating the impact of adopting sfas revised  we are also considering the potential implementation of different valuation models to determine the fair value of stock based compensation  although no decision has yet been made 
however  we believe the adoption of sfas revised will have a material impact on our results of operations  regardless of the valuation technique used 
if we were to continue to use a black scholes option pricing model consistent with our current practice  the adoption of sfas revised on july   using a modified prospective application  is expected to result in additional compensation expense of to million before income taxes for the year ended december  results of operations this discussion of our results of operations contains forward looking statements regarding revenue  research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with our forward looking projections  please see the factors that may affect our future results section in this form k

tanox entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement in july to have a third party manufacture and supply tanox s tnx for phase clinical trials and potential product launch 
payments due to this third party under the agreement are based on the achievement of manufacturing deliverables and quantities to be manufactured based on the size of clinical trials 
under the terms of the agreement  if tanox were to terminate the agreement before or upon completion of the technology transfer deliverable research stage  it would be required to pay a cancellation fee equal to twenty five percent of the un invoiced portion of the remaining process development program balance  as defined in the agreement 
tanox and the third party manufacturer began discussions in the fourth quarter of related to revisions to the agreement because we determined that we would produce tnx for phase clinical trials in a manufacturing facility on which we assumed the lease in january in february  a letter agreement with the third party manufacturer was reached to suspend all provisions of the agreement for a period to be determined by us  but not to exceed months 
we plan to resume production of tnx under this agreement on or before august  under the terms of the letter agreement  tanox will pay a total of million of which  represents a cancellation fee and the remaining  may be credited against future work performed by the third party manufacturer  subject to certain limitations 
we will also pay  for work performed by the third party manufacturer as of december  the total amount accrued as of december  related to this transaction was  as research and development expense 
we were engaged in litigation in connection with a fee dispute with the law firms that represented us in litigation with genentech relating to  among other things  the intellectual property rights surrounding the development of anti ige technology 
in  an arbitration panel issued an award entitling the attorneys to receive approximately million  including interest  payments ranging from to of the future milestone payments  in excess of the first million  we would receive from genentech following product approval  and of the royalties that we would receive on all sales of certain anti ige products  including xolair 
during the appeals process  we were required to place amounts in escrow to secure payment of the award  and had escrowed million with the harris county district court as of december  these funds were released to the former attorneys in february the payment due to the attorneys in the amount of of the royalties we receive on xolair sales is required to be paid within days of the end of each calendar quarter in which the royalty payments are received by tanox 
on february   tanox  genentech and novartis entered into a tripartite collaboration agreement to settle all then outstanding litigation and arbitrations among the parties and to finalize the detailed terms of the three party collaboration  begun in  to develop and commercialize certain anti ige antibodies  including xolair and tnx under the terms of the three party collaboration agreement  genentech and novartis each reimbursed tanox million for a portion of its tnx development costs  and tanox relinquished any rights to manufacture xolair and  in exchange  will receive payments tied to the quantity of xolair produced 
tanox and novartis also entered into an amended and restated development and licensing agreement in february from through  novartis advanced tanox million  pursuant to a loan agreement  to finance the construction of our pilot plant manufacturing facility 
under the terms of the amended and restated development and licensing agreement  the principal and accrued interest of  were forgiven in full by novartis and recorded by tanox as a capital infusion since novartis is a related party for accounting purposes 
in september  we entered into a million revolving line of credit note agreement with a bank 
under the terms of the agreement  tanox may secure advances up to the aggregate principal amount of million  the proceeds of which can be used to finance the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
the outstanding principal balance is payable in full on september   and advances bear interest at the lesser of the prime rate or libor  the london interbank offered rate  plus 
accrued interest is payable on the last day of each month 
as of december   we had borrowed million under the agreement 
during the year ended december   we invested approximately million in equipment and facility improvements 
pursuant to a lease assignment and asset purchase agreement dated december   between biogen idec and tanox  on january   we acquired from biogen idec certain manufacturing  process development and qa qc equipment  related documentation and furniture and fixtures housed in a  square foot leased facility located in san diego  california 
we also agreed to assume the obligations of biogen idec under the triple net lease for the facility  which extends until october  with two five year extension options 
the lease payments for will be million and will increase annually over the term of the lease  including extension periods  at a rate of approximately 
upon closing of the transaction on january   we paid biogen idec approximately million for the assets 
as partial consideration for tanox s agreement to the extension of the lease term to september  and assuming tanox is not then in default under the lease agreement  biogen idec agreed to make two payments to us  each in the amount of approximately million  on september  and november  the total future lease obligation of tanox for this lease assignment through  net of the biogen idec payments  should approximate million 
the following table represents tanox s contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year to years to years more than years operating leases notes payable purchase obligations total this does not include the lease assignment and asset purchase dated december  between biogen idec and tanox signed on january  which will be a total commitment of million through purchase obligations includes commitments related to manufacturing operations and  of this amount is included in research and development expenses and accrued liabilities at december  our current and anticipated development projects require substantial additional capital to complete 
we do not expect to generate positive cash flow from operations until at least because we anticipate that the amount of cash we need to fund operations  including research and development  manufacturing and other costs  and for capital expenditures  will grow in the future as our projects move from research to clinical development to commercialization 
we may make acquisitions of businesses or intellectual property assets and also expect that we will need to expand our clinical development  manufacturing capacity  facilities  business development and marketing activities to support the future development of our programs 
based on cash projections  we expect that cash on hand and revenue from operations will be sufficient to fund our existing operations for at least the next four years 
however  our future capital needs will depend on many factors  including the continued successful commercialization of xolair  progress in our research and development activities  commercialization activities  the costs and magnitude of product or technology acquisitions  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  changes in or terminations of existing collaboration and licensing arrangements  establishing additional collaboration and licensing arrangements  potential merger and acquisition activities  and manufacturing scale up costs and marketing activities  if we undertake those activities 
consequently  we may need to raise additional funds  and we may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity securities 
we do not have external committed sources of funding and we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our programs  obtain funds through arrangements with collaboration partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves  or license rights to technologies  product candidates or products on terms that are less favorable to us than might otherwise be available 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates 
in the normal course of business  we have established policies and procedures to manage these risks 
foreign currency exchange rates 
we were subject to foreign currency exchange risk because we conducted operations through two foreign subsidiaries prior to the closing of tanox pharma bv and our taiwan office in interest rate risk 
cash  cash equivalents and investments were approximately million including the restricted cash of million at december  these assets were primarily invested in investment grade corporate bonds and commercial paper with maturities of less than three years  which we have the ability and intent to hold to maturity 
we do not invest in derivative securities 
although our portfolio is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and market conditions  no gain or loss on any security would actually be recognized in earnings unless we sell the asset 
in addition  our bank line of credit is based on a premium over libor 
as such  if general interest rates increase  our interest costs will increase
