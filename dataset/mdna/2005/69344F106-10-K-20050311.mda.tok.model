item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
we generate revenues from the sale of semiconductor devices that we have designed and developed 
almost all of our revenues in any given year come from the sale of semiconductors that are developed prior to that year 
for example  more than of our revenues in came from parts developed in and earlier 
after an individual product is completed and announced it may take several years before that device generates any significant revenues 
our current revenue is generated by a portfolio of more than products 
in addition to incurring costs for the marketing  sales and administration of the sale of existing products  we expend a substantial amount every year for the development of new semiconductor devices 
we determine the amount to invest in the development of new semiconductors based on our assessment of the future market opportunities for those components  and the estimated return on investment 
throughout this period  we have maintained our research and development spending at a level that we believe matches current market opportunities 
net revenues millions change change networking products non networking products net revenues net revenues for increased million  or over net revenues in net revenues for increased million  or  over net revenues in our non networking products reached end of life status in we had only networking revenues in and do not expect to generate non networking revenues in the future 
during the first half of  we saw increased revenues from the markets for our telecommunication service provider products  particularly for asymmetric digital subscriber line  or adsl  wireless  and wireline infrastructure applications in china and north america  improving demand for equipment that incorporates our metro optical transport products and relatively low levels of supply chain inventories  resulting in new orders for pmc products 
during the second half of we saw a sequential quarterly decline in revenues due to telecom and enterprise customers working down their inventory levels and lower order rates from china 
this inventory rebalancing was not specific to any one customer or area of our business  but was related to customers in general adjusting inventory levels down to reflect shorter component lead times and lower equipment demand levels 
although some customers have continued to reduce their inventory levels  we believe that the revenue trends have stabilized see business outlook 
in the third quarter of  we approved a routine request from one of our distributors to dispose of certain slow moving inventory  and we completed a specific inventory reduction program  which resulted in net revenue of million 
companies in the semiconductor industry periodically undertake such initiatives to reduce slow moving inventory in sales channels so that customers maintain a mix of inventory suitable for current market demand 
all criteria for revenue recognition were met as the inventory was delivered  title was transferred  payment was received and the price became fixed at the time the inventory was disposed of 
all of the economic incentives offered to the distributor were included in our third quarter results of operations as revenue reductions 
in  we saw an improvement over the business conditions that had depressed demand for our communication products in we saw improved demand for our microprocessor products in enterprise related applications and products used in asynchronous digital subscriber line adsl infrastructure applications 
our customers began placing new orders for our products as they depleted their inventories of our products that they had held over the previous two years 
over the past three years  we have seen significant growth in net revenues generated in asia 
net revenues from asia have grown to of total net revenues in from in  and in we attribute this trend primarily to increased manufacturing outsourcing into asia by our oem customers as well as increased levels of activity at asian customers 
gross profit millions change change networking products percentage of networking revenues non networking products percentage of non networking revenues total gross profit percentage of net revenues total gross profit for increased by million  or over gross profit in  which increased by million  or  over gross profit in the increase in related primarily to higher sales volumes and higher margins 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in this increase resulted from the following factors higher shipment volumes resulted in manufacturing costs being spread over a greater number of units  increasing gross margin by percentage points  and a greater portion of our sales were from our higher margin products  which increased gross profit by approximately percentage points 
our gross profit for increased by million over gross profit in this increase in gross profit related primarily to higher sales volumes in compared to also contributing to the increase in gross profit was the decrease in write downs for excess inventory from million in to nil in gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in the following factors affected the margins in compared to a decrease in the write down of excess inventory from million in to nil in  increasing gross profit by percentage points  and higher shipment volumes resulted in manufacturing costs being spread over a greater number of units  increasing gross margin by percentage points 
other costs and expenses millions change change research and development percentage of net revenues marketing  general and administrative percentage of net revenues amortization of deferred stock compensation research and development marketing  general and administrative percentage of net revenues impairment of property and equipment percentage of net revenues restructuring costs percentage of net revenues acquisition costs percentage of net revenues research and development expenses our research and development  or r d  expenses were million  or  higher in compared to due primarily to a million increase in personnel and contractor costs and million increase in amortization of intellectual property related to developed technology acquired in fiscal these increases were offset by a million reduction in depreciation expense as equipment and development tools became fully depreciated and were not replaced 
our r d expenses were million  or  lower in compared to due to the restructuring program implemented in the first quarter of and ongoing cost reduction initiatives 
headcount reductions resulting from the first quarter restructuring program and attrition have decreased our r d personnel and related costs by million 
of the remaining million decrease in other r d expenses since  million related to reduced depreciation expense as more property and equipment became fully depreciated and was not replaced 
another reason for the decrease in r d expenses was that costs incurred for product development tools were million lower in than in as less software and related maintenance was required to support current development activity levels 
contributing to this reduction in tooling costs was the closure of our development sites in ireland  india and maryland as there were fewer licenses required to support the reduced r d headcount 
marketing  general and administrative expenses our marketing  general and administrative  or mg a  expenses were million  or less than higher in compared to due primarily to a million increase in personnel and contractor costs which was offset by a million reduction in depreciation expense as assets became fully depreciated and were not replaced 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of we eliminated a million provision for employee related taxes on completion of a payroll tax audit 
in  our mg a expenses decreased million  or compared to reductions in headcount due to our first quarter restructuring program and attrition resulted in a decrease of personnel related costs of million 
other mg a expenses decreased million primarily due to reduced sales commissions of million  reduced spending on marketing and corporate communications of million  and decreased professional fees of million 
the reduction in professional fees included the elimination of a provision for potential litigation costs of million 
this amount was established as a reserve in the third quarter of for potential litigation costs related to a dispute with the general partner of one of our venture capital fund investments 
in the fourth quarter of  we accepted a proposal from the general partner to restructure the fund  thereby settling the dispute and eliminating the need for the reserve 
other mg a expenses also decreased million due to a reduction in facilities related costs  resulting from our restructuring programs and ongoing cost control measures 
amortization of deferred stock compensation we recorded a non cash charge of million for amortization of deferred stock compensation in compared to million in and million in deferred stock compensation charges decreased million from to and million from to due to timing of amortization of deferred stock compensation for certain employees 
impairment of property and equipment there were no impairments of property and equipment in or in  we recorded an impairment charge of million reflecting a reduction in the estimated fair value of a production tester 
this equipment was removed from service because lower manufacturing and product development volumes resulted in excess product testing capacity 
restructuring costs in response to the severe economic downturn in the semiconductor industry in  we implemented two restructuring plans aimed at focusing development efforts on key projects and reducing operating costs 
by the first quarter of  we were still operating in a challenging economic climate  making it necessary to again streamline operations and announce a further restructuring 
our assessment of market demand for our products and the development efforts necessary to meet this demand were key factors in our decisions to implement these restructuring plans 
as end markets for our products had contracted  certain projects were curtailed in an effort to cut research and development costs 
cost reductions in all other functional areas were also implemented  as fewer resources were required to support the reduced level of development and sales activities during this period 
we have completed substantially all of the activities contemplated in the original restructuring plans  but have not yet disposed of all our surplus leased facilities as of december  upon the final disposition of our surplus leased facilities  we expect to achieve annualized savings of approximately million  million  and million in cost of revenues and operating expenses based on the expenditure levels at the time of the respective march  october and january restructurings 
restructuring march  in the first quarter of  we implemented a restructuring plan in response to the decline in demand for our networking products and consequently recorded a restructuring charge of million 
the restructuring plan included the involuntary termination of employees across all business functions  partial closures of design facilities in kanata  santa clara  montreal  burnaby  and maryland  the closure of product design facilities in san diego and denver and the curtailment of semiconductor design activity across the networking markets we serve 
we completed the restructuring activities contemplated in our march restructuring plan by june however  we still have ongoing rental commitments for office space in maryland and kanata  which we abandoned under this plan 
due to the continued downturn in real estate markets  we expect these costs to be higher than anticipated in the original plan 
as a result  we recorded additional provisions for abandoned office facilities of million in the third quarter of and an additional million in the fourth quarter of cash payments under this plan since the fourth quarter of were million 
the following summarizes the activity in the march restructuring liability for the three years ended december  in thousands workforce reduction facility lease and contract settlement costs total balance at december  adjustments cash payments balance at december  additional charges cash payments balance at december  additional charges cash payments balance at december  restructuring october  due to a continued decline in market conditions  we implemented a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of to reduce our operating cost structure 
this restructuring plan included the termination of employees across all business functions  the consolidation of excess facilities in burnaby  portland  allentown  and santa clara  the closure of a product design facility in toronto  and the curtailment of certain research and development projects 
as a result  we recorded a restructuring charge of million in the fourth quarter of  including million of asset write downs 
to date  we have made cash payments under this plan of million  including the purchase and sale of mission towers two in santa clara  ca  for million and million  respectively  in the third quarter of to date  we have reversed million of excess restructure provision  primarily related to mission towers two 
while we have completed our restructuring activities  we still have ongoing rental commitments for office space abandoned under this plan 
due to the continued downturn in real estate markets  we expect these costs to be higher than anticipated in the original plan 
as a result  we recorded additional provisions for abandoned office facilities of million in the fourth quarter of the following summarizes the activity in the october restructuring accrual for the three years ended december  in thousands workforce reduction facility lease and contract settlement costs total balance at december  adjustments cash payments balance at december  reversals cash payments balance at december  additional charges cash payments balance at december  restructuring january  as a result of the prolonged economic downturn in the semiconductor industry  we implemented another corporate restructuring aimed at further reducing operating expenses in the first quarter of the restructuring included the termination of employees and the closure of design centers in maryland  ireland and india 
to date  we have recorded a restructuring charge of million in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  including million for asset write downs 
these charges related to workforce reduction  lease and contract settlement costs  and the write down of certain property  equipment and software assets whose value was impaired as a result of this restructuring plan 
we planned to and have disposed of the property improvements and computer equipment  and software licenses have been cancelled or are no longer being used 
cash payments made to date under this plan were million 
to date we have reversed million from the provision relating to workforce reduction 
activity in this restructuring accrual during fiscal and was as follows in thousands workforce reduction facility lease and contract settlement costs asset writedowns total total charge january  additional charges noncash charges adjustments cash payments balance at december  adjustments cash payments balance at december  these restructuring plans changed only the scope  and not the nature  of our operations 
through these restructurings we refocused our product development and sales activities on a smaller number of products and end users 
at the completion of the restructuring plans  our intention is to have sized our operations to be profitable given current end market conditions  while leaving sufficient development resources in place in areas of historic capability to take advantage of product development opportunities as the end markets we serve begin to recover 
acquisition costs in the third quarter of  we purchased assets and intellectual property from a privately held company for cash of million and assumption of liabilities of million 
included in operating expenses were transaction costs of million  consisting of accounting  legal and other professional fees relating to the purchase 
other income and expenses millions change change interest income  net percentage of net revenues foreign exchange loss percentage of net revenues gain loss on extinguishment of debt and amortization of debt issue costs percentage of net revenues gain loss on investments percentage of net revenues interest income  net net interest income increased by million in compared to and decreased by million in compared to in our interest income increased due to interest expense savings of million from the repurchase of a portion of our convertible subordinated notes 
these savings were partially offset by a decline in interest revenue of million due to a decline in cash balances and average yields on our cash  short term and long term investments 
in our interest income declined by approximately million compared to as a result of a decline in average yields on our cash  short term and long term investments 
million of the decrease was due to an overall decline in our average cash balances 
foreign exchange loss foreign exchange loss increased to million in compared to million in and nil in we have a significant design presence outside the united states  especially in canada 
the majority of our operating expense exposures to changes in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar have been hedged through december the foreign exchange loss for all years presented relates primarily to the re measurement of accrued income tax amounts in our canadian subsidiary 
we do not hedge our accrual for canadian income taxes in the ordinary course of business see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk gain loss on extinguishment of debt and amortization of debt issue costs we recognized amortization of debt issue costs of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
we recognized an additional loss of million and gain of million in and respectively as a result of the repurchase of a portion of our convertible subordinated notes 
in the first quarter of  we repurchased million face value of our convertible subordinated notes at par and expensed million of related unamortized debt issue costs 
we also incurred transaction related costs of million resulting in an aggregate net loss on the repurchase of million 
on january  we redeemed the remaining outstanding notes of million for a total of million in cash  which included million in accrued interest and a million call premium 
in the third quarter of  we repurchased million face value of our convertible subordinated notes for million and expensed million of related unamortized debt issue costs  resulting in a net gain of million 
gain loss on investments in we received proceeds of million from the sale of investments 
of this amount  million was received from the sale of our investments in three professionally managed venture funds and a private technology company 
we recorded net gains of million 
in  we sold our remaining investment in sierra wireless  inc  a public company  resulting in a gain of million 
we also recorded a million charge for the impairment of a portion of our investments in non public companies 
provision for income taxes our annual effective tax rate for the year ended december  was a recovery of  compared to a united states federal statutory tax rate of 
our effective tax rate represents a rate which is applicable to all of our operations crossing multiple tax jurisdictions with tax rates which are different than the united states federal statutory tax rate 
we also operate in tax jurisdictions which have regulations which permit the carry back of current period tax losses and credits to prior periods when income taxes were paid 
our effective tax rate in all years presented reflects recoveries and refunds of prior year taxes paid and tax credits received by our canadian subsidiary for research and development expenses incurred offset by valuation allowances on losses carried forward 
in  we estimated that the effective tax rate applicable to our operations was 
however  we reduced our tax liabilities associated with current period income primarily for amounts we have or expect to recover from prior year taxes as a result of agreements and assessments with the canada revenue agency 
for the year ended december  we estimated our effective tax rate to be 
however  primarily as a result of additional initiatives undertaken to identify and carry back tax losses to prior periods when taxes were paid  our tax rate for the period was a recovery of 
our annual effective tax rate for the year ended december  was a recovery of 
our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate and the rates in later years primarily as a result of tax rates applicable in the geographies in which we operate and a million valuation allowance provided on deferred tax assets  where likelihood of realization is uncertain 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes 
critical accounting policies and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts we report as assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are reasonable in the circumstances 
these estimates could change under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in management s opinion the following critical accounting policies require the most significant judgment and involve complex estimation 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies of revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenues on sales to major distributors  however these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates as they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
restructuring charges facilities in calculating the cost to dispose of our excess facilities we had to estimate for each location the amount to be paid in lease termination payments  the future lease and operating costs to be paid until the lease is terminated  and the amount of sublease revenues 
this required us to estimate the timing and costs of each lease to be terminated  the amount of operating costs for the affected facilities  and the timing and rate at which we might be able to sublease each site 
to form our estimates for these costs we performed an assessment of the affected facilities and considered the current market conditions for each site 
during  we recorded total charges of million for the restructuring of excess facilities as part of two restructuring plans 
after elimination of the lease obligation related to mission towers two during  we performed a review of our assumptions relating to the remaining lease commitments using current market conditions for the timing and rates to sublet or cancel the lease for each of the remaining facilities 
based on this analysis we determined that an additional charge of million was required for facilities closure costs due to further deterioration in facilities leasing markets 
based on a similar analysis performed in the fourth quarter of we determined that an additional million was required due to further deterioration in facilities leasing markets 
the accrual at the end of of million represents of the estimated total future operating costs and lease obligations for those affected sites 
in the first quarter of  we announced a further restructuring of our operations  which resulted in the closing of an additional four product development sites two in ireland  one in india and our maryland site and in we recorded total charges of million when we abandoned usage of these sites 
the amount unpaid at the end of of million represents of the estimated total future operating costs and lease obligations for the affected sites 
our assumptions on either the lease termination payments  operating costs until lease termination  or the amounts and timing of offsetting sublease revenues may turn out to be incorrect and our actual cost may be materially different from our estimates 
if our actual costs exceed our estimates  we would incur additional expenses in future periods 
inventory we periodically compare our inventory levels to sales forecasts for the future twelve months on a part by part basis and record a charge for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated twelve month demand 
we recorded a charge of million in as our inventory of networking products exceeded estimated month demand 
if future demand for our products were to decline  we may have to take an additional write down of inventory 
income taxes we have incurred losses and other costs that can be applied against future taxable earnings to reduce our tax liability on those earnings 
as we are uncertain of realizing the future benefit of those losses and expenditures  we have taken a valuation allowance against all domestic and foreign deferred tax assets 
our operations are conducted in a number of countries with complex tax legislation and regulations pertaining to our activities 
we have recorded income tax liabilities based on our estimates and interpretations of those regulations for the countries we operate in 
however our estimates are subject to review and assessment by the tax authorities and the courts of those countries 
the timing of any such review and final assessment of our liabilities by local authorities is substantially out of our control and is dependent on the actions by those authorities in the countries we operate in 
any re assessment of our tax liabilities by tax authorities may result in adjustments of the income taxes we pay or refunds that are due to us 
investment in non public entities we have investments in non public companies and have previously invested in venture capital funds  which we review periodically to determine if there has been a non temporary decline in the market value of those investments below our carrying value 
our assessment of impairment in carrying value is based on the market value trends of similar public companies  the current business performance of the entities in which we have invested  and if available  the estimated future market potential of the companies and venture funds 
in we recorded a charge of million for impairment of our investments in non public entities 
we did not record such an impairment charge in when we perform future assessments of these investments  a further decline in the value of these companies may require us to recognize additional impairment on the remaining million carrying value of our investments 
valuation of long lived assets including goodwill and purchased intangible assets we review property and equipment  goodwill and purchased intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
such events may include a change in business strategy  significant declines in our sales forecast or prolonged negative industry or economic trends 
our asset impairment review assesses the fair value of the assets based on the future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
for long lived assets  an impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset if any are less than the carrying value of the asset 
for goodwill  an impairment loss will be recorded to the extent than the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
in we recorded a charge for impairment of purchased intangible assets 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million reflecting the reduction in fair value of a product tester 
we did not identify any impairment to goodwill or purchased intangibles during our annual assessments in business outlook we expect our networking revenues for the first quarter of to increase approximately to from the fourth quarter of based on typical order patterns 
as in the past  and consistent with business practice in the semiconductor industry  a portion of our revenues are likely to be derived from orders placed and shipped during the same quarter  which we call our turns business 
our turns business varies from quarter to quarter 
in the fourth quarter of our turns business comprised a lower than normal percentage of revenues as customer inventory adjustments continued in the markets we serve 
beyond the first quarter of  we anticipate revenues will improve as we believe our turns business is improving  although it is not yet fully normalized 
the outlook for revenue is sometimes subject to dramatic changes in customer demand and customer component inventory levels 
we anticipate our gross margins will be approximately to in the first quarter of  but margins could vary significantly depending on the volumes and mix of products sold 
we expect slightly elevated operating expenses in the first quarter of from the fourth quarter of as the first fiscal period of will have weeks compared to in the fourth quarter of in order to align our fiscal year end with the calendar year end 
elements of expense such as salaries  rent  and depreciation are calculated based on the number of weeks in a period 
therefore  the incremental expense associated with the extra week based upon prior period comparatives is approximately million 
additional payroll benefits such as employer taxes and retirement plan contributions are also typically incurred in the first half of a calendar year 
we anticipate that interest income will increase in compared to as we expect to generate cash from operations and financing activities 
in addition  we have eliminated interest expense through the repurchase of our remaining convertible subordinated notes see note of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe trends that impact our operating performance  such as service provider infrastructure spending  enterprise network capital spending  communications component inventories  and general economic performance in north america and asia  have stabilized and are beginning to show signs of improvement 
while we are unable to ascertain the extent to which these factors will affect our operating results  given our broad product and customer range and the complexity of the markets we serve  we believe these trends are positive for our market opportunity over the years to come 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity at december  was million in cash and investments  which included million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and million of long term investments in bonds and notes which mature within the next to months 
in  we generated million of cash from operating activities 
changes in working capital accounts included a million increase in net income tax liabilities as we received a refund of taxes from the canadian government that reduced a receivable which offset our net tax liabilities  a million reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due primarily to payment of a million supplier invoice included in our fiscal year balance  a reduction in other trade payables of million due to the timing of payments  a million elimination of a provision for employee related taxes  and a million reduction in our accrual for semi annual interest on our convertible notes  an million decrease in deferred income due primarily to the disposition by one of our distributors of slow moving inventory on which income was previously deferred and for which all criteria for revenue recognition have been met  a million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets  as we renewed development software and maintenance contracts  a million reduction in inventories  as we continued our efforts to reduce our networking product inventories  a million decrease in accrued restructuring costs due to cash payments for leased facilities  which was partially offset by additional charges  and a million decrease in accounts receivable  as a result of a decrease in revenues in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of in cash flows from our investment activities included cash proceeds of million from the sale or maturities of short term and long term debt investments  the purchase of million of long term and short term debt investments  an investment of million for the purchases of property and equipment  and cash proceeds of million from the sale of our venture fund investments and other assets which was partially offset by million investments in such entities during the year 
in cash flows from our financing activities included million of cash was used to repurchase a portion of our convertible subordinated notes  and cash proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock under our equity based compensation plans 
as of december  we have the following commitments in thousands contractual obligations total after operating lease obligations minimum rental payments estimated operating cost payments long term debt principal repayment interest payments and call premium purchase and other obligations subsequent to december  we repurchased the remaining million of our convertible subordinated notes  eliminating the principal commitment and reducing the interest and call premium payment commitment by million in the above table 
purchase obligations are comprised of commitments to purchase design tools and software for use in product development 
we have not included open purchase orders for inventory or other expenses issued in the normal course of business in the purchase obligations shown above 
we estimate these other commitments to be approximately million at december  for inventory and other expenses that will be received in the coming days and that will require settlement days thereafter 
we have a line of credit with a bank that allows us to borrow up to million provided we maintain eligible investments with the bank equal to the amount drawn on the line of credit 
at december  we had committed million under letters of credit as security for office leases 
we expect to use approximately million of cash in for capital expenditures 
based on our current operating prospects  we believe that existing sources of liquidity will satisfy our projected operating  working capital  capital expenditure  wafer deposit and remaining restructuring requirements through the end of our expectation as to the sufficiency of our capital resources is based on the assumption that our market has stabilized 
while we believe our current liquidity will be sufficient to meet our long term needs for capital  we operate in an industry that is subject to rapid technological and economic changes 
in addition  we may contemplate mergers and acquisitions of other companies or assets as part of our business strategy 
consequently in the future we may determine that our sources of liquidity are insufficient and we may proceed with financing or other activities  which may dilute your investment or impact our liquidity and operating results 
factors that you should consider before investing in pmc sierra our company is subject to a number of risks some are normal to the fabless semiconductor industry  some are the same or similar to those disclosed in previous sec filings  and some may be present in the future 
you should carefully consider all of these risks and the other information in this report before investing in pmc 
the fact that certain risks are endemic to the industry does not lessen the significance of the risk 
we are subject to rapid changes in demand for our products due to customer inventory levels  production schedules  fluctuations in demand for networking equipment and our customer concentration 
as a result of these risks  our business  financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 
this could cause the trading price of our securities to decline  and you may lose part or all of your investment 
we have very limited revenue visibility 
our ability to project revenues is limited because a significant portion of our quarterly revenues may be derived from orders placed and shipped in the same quarter  which we call our turns business 
our turns business varies widely quarter to quarter 
uncertainty in our customers end markets and our customers increased focus on cash management has caused our customers to delay product orders and reduce delivery lead time expectations  which reduces our ability to project revenues beyond the current quarter 
we may fail to meet our demand forecasts if our customers cancel or delay the purchase of our products 
many of our customers have numerous product lines  numerous component requirements for each product  sizeable and complex supplier structures  and typically engage contract manufacturers for additional manufacturing capacity 
in addition  our customers often shift buying patterns as they manage inventory levels  market different products  or change production schedules 
this makes forecasting their production requirements difficult and can lead to an inventory surplus of certain of their components 
we may be unable to deliver products to customers when they require them if we incorrectly estimate future demand  and this may lead to higher fluctuations in shipments of our products 
we may also experience an increase in the proportion of our revenues in future periods that will be from orders placed and fulfilled within the same period  which would further decrease our ability to accurately forecast operating results 
as most of our costs are fixed in the short term  a reduction in demand for our products may cause a proportionately greater decline in our operating results 
we rely on a few customers for a major portion of our sales  any one of which could materially impact our revenues should they change their ordering pattern 
we depend on a limited number of customers for a major portion of our revenues 
through direct  distributor and subcontractor purchases  cisco systems accounted for more than of our revenues in we do not have long term volume purchase commitments from any of our major customers 
accordingly  our future operating results will continue to depend on the success of our largest customers and on our ability to sell existing and new products to these customers in significant quantities 
while our larger customers have indicated growth expectations in  this may not necessarily translate into revenues for pmc 
the loss of our key customer  or a reduction in our sales to any major customer or our inability to attract new significant customers could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our revenues may decline if we do not maintain a competitive portfolio of products 
we are experiencing significantly greater competition from many different market participants as the market in which we participate matures 
in addition  we are expanding into markets  such as the wireless infrastructure  enterprise storage  and generic microprocessor markets  which have established incumbents with substantial financial and technological resources 
we expect more intense competition than that which we have traditionally faced as some of these incumbents derive a majority of their earnings from these markets 
increasing competition can make it more difficult to achieve design wins 
we typically face competition at the design stage  where customers evaluate alternative design approaches requiring integrated circuits 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological advancement in design tools  wafer manufacturing techniques  process tools and alternate networking technologies 
we may not be able to develop new products at competitive pricing and performance levels 
even if we are able to do so  we may not complete a new product and introduce it to market in a timely manner 
our customers may substitute use of our products in their next generation equipment with those of current or future competitors  reducing our future revenues 
with the shortening product life and design in cycles in many of our customers products  our competitors may have more opportunities to supplant our products in next generation systems 
our customers are increasingly price conscious  as semiconductors sourced from third party suppliers comprise a greater portion of the total materials cost in networking equipment 
we continue to experience more aggressive price competition from competitors that wish to enter into the market segments in which we participate 
these circumstances may make some of our products less competitive and we may be forced to decrease our prices significantly to win a design 
we may lose design opportunities or may experience overall declines in gross margins as a result of increased price competition 
we face significant competition from two major fronts 
first  we compete against established peer group semiconductor companies that focus on the communications semiconductor business 
these companies include agere systems  applied micro circuits corporation  broadcom  exar corporation  conexant systems  marvell technology group  multilink technology corporation  silicon image  transwitch and vitesse semiconductor 
these companies are well financed  have significant communications semiconductor technology assets  have established sales channels  and are dependent on the market in which we participate for the bulk of their revenues 
other competitors include major domestic and international semiconductor companies  such as agilent  cypress semiconductor  intel  ibm  infineon  integrated device technology  maxim integrated products  motorola  nec  texas instruments  and toshiba 
these companies are concentrating an increasing amount of their substantial financial and other resources on the markets in which we participate 
this represents a serious competitive threat to us 
over the next few years  we expect additional competitors  some of which may also have greater financial and other resources  to enter the market with new products 
these companies  individually or collectively  could represent future competition for many design wins  and subsequent product sales 
we may have to redesign our products to meet evolving industry standards and customer specifications  which may prevent or delay future revenue growth 
we sell products to customers whose characteristics include evolving industry standards  short product lifespans  and new manufacturing and design technologies 
many of the standards and protocols for our products are based on networking technologies that may not have been widely adopted or ratified by one or more of the standard setting bodies in our customers industry 
our customers may delay or alter their design demands during this standard setting process 
in response  we must redesign our products to suit these changing demands 
redesign is expensive and usually delays the production of our products 
our products may become obsolete during these delays 
design wins do not translate into near term revenues and the timing of revenues from newly designed products is often uncertain 
from time to time  we announce new products and design wins for existing and new products 
while some industry analysts may use design wins as a metric for future revenues  many design wins have not  and will not generate any revenues for us as customer projects are cancelled or unsuccessful in their end market 
in the event a design win generates revenue  the amount of revenue will vary greatly from one design win to another 
in addition  most revenue generating design wins do not translate into near term revenues 
most revenue generating design wins take more than years to generate meaningful revenue 
our strategy includes broadening our business into the enterprise  storage and consumer markets 
we may not be successful in achieving significant sales in these new markets 
the enterprise  storage and consumer markets are already serviced by incumbent suppliers who have established relationships with customers 
we may be unsuccessful in displacing these suppliers  or having our products designed into products for different market needs 
in order to compete against incumbents  we may need to lower our prices to win new business  which could lower our gross margin 
we may incur increased research  development and sales costs to address these new markets 
we are subject to the risks of conducting business outside the united states  which may impair our sales  development or manufacturing of our products 
in addition to selling our products in a number of countries  a significant portion of our research and development and manufacturing is conducted outside the united states 
the geographic diversity of our business operations could hinder our ability to coordinate design and sales activities 
if we are unable to develop systems and communication processes to support our geographic diversity  we may suffer product development delays or strained customer relationships 
if foreign exchange rates fluctuate significantly  our profitability may decline 
we are exposed to foreign currency rate fluctuations because a significant part of our development  test  marketing and administrative costs are in canadian dollars  and our selling costs are incurred in a variety of currencies around the world 
the us dollar has devalued significantly compared to the canadian dollar and this trend may continue 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts 
the contracts reduce  but do not eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
in addition  this foreign currency risk management policy may not be effective in addressing long term fluctuations since our contracts do not extend beyond a month maturity 
we regularly limit our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations from our canadian dollar net asset or liability positions 
we do not hedge our accrual for canadian income taxes in the ordinary course of business  and consequently in we incurred a million foreign exchange loss relating to this item 
our profitability would be materially impacted by a shift in the foreign exchange rates between united states and canadian currencies 
changes in the political and economic climate in china and taiwan may have a significant impact on our profitability 
china represents a significant portion of our net revenues and for each of the years ended december  and  respectively  based on ship to location 
our financial condition and results of operations are becoming increasingly dependent on our sales in china 
any instability in china s economic environment could lead to a contraction of capital spending by our customers 
additional risks to us include economic sanctions imposed by the us government  imposition of tariffs and other potential trade barriers or regulations  uncertain protection for intellectual property rights and generally longer receivable collection periods 
we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and we may have difficulty collecting receivables from customers based in foreign countries 
many of our customers employ contract manufacturers to produce their products and manage their inventories 
many of these contract manufacturers represent greater credit risk than our networking equipment customers  who generally do not guarantee our credit receivables related to their contract manufacturers 
in addition  a significant portion of our sales flow through our distribution channel which generally represent a higher credit risk 
should these companies enter into bankruptcy proceedings or breach their debt covenants  our revenues could decrease and collection of our significant accounts receivables with these companies could be jeopardized 
we may lose our ability to design or produce products  could face additional unforeseen costs or could lose access to key customers if any of the nations in which we conduct business impose trade barriers or new communications standards 
we may have difficulty obtaining export licenses for certain technology produced for us outside the united states 
if a foreign country imposes new taxes  tariffs  quotas  and other trade barriers and restrictions or the united states and a foreign country develop hostilities or change diplomatic and trade relationships  we may not be able to continue manufacturing or sub assembly of our products in that country and may have fewer sales in that country 
we may also have fewer sales in a country that imposes new communications standards or technologies 
this could inhibit our ability to meet our customers demand for our products and lower our revenues 
our strategy of expansion in new markets may cause our profit margins to decline 
our business strategy contemplates expansion of our product offerings in relatively high volume target markets  such as storage and consumer applications 
these markets typically are characterized by stronger price competition and  consequently  lower per unit profit margins 
if we are successful in these markets  our overall profit margins could decline  as lower margin products may comprise a greater portion of our revenues 
our business strategy contemplates acquisition of other companies or technologies  which could adversely affect our operating performance 
acquiring products  technologies or businesses from third parties is part of our business strategy 
management may be diverted from our operations while they identify and negotiate these acquisitions and integrate an acquired entity into our operations 
also  we may be forced to develop expertise outside our existing businesses  and replace key personnel who leave due to an acquisition 
an acquisition could absorb substantial cash resources  require us to incur or assume debt obligations  or issue additional equity 
if we issue more equity  we may dilute our common stock with securities that have an equal or a senior interest in our company 
acquired entities also may have unknown liabilities  and the combined entity may not achieve the results that were anticipated at the time of the acquisition 
from time to time  we license  or acquire  technology from third parties to incorporate into our products 
incorporating technology into our products may be more costly  or result in additional management attention to achieve the desired functionality 
product sales mix may adversely affect our profitability over time 
our products range widely in terms of the margins they generate 
a change in product sales mix could impact our operating results materially 
we may be unsuccessful in transitioning the design of our new products to new manufacturing processes 
many of our new products are designed to take advantage of new manufacturing processes offering smaller manufacturing geometries as they become available  since smaller geometries can provide a product with improved features such as lower power requirements  increased performance  more functionality and lower cost 
we believe that the transition of our products to  and introduction of new products using  smaller geometries is critical for us to remain competitive 
we could experience difficulties in migrating to future geometries or manufacturing processes  which would result in the delay of the production of our products 
our products may become obsolete during these delays  or allow competitors parts to be chosen by customers during the design process 
since many of the products we develop do not reach full production sales volumes for a number of years  we may incorrectly anticipate market demand and develop products that achieve little or no market acceptance 
our products generally take between and months from initial conceptualization to development of a viable prototype  and another to months to be designed into our customers equipment and sold in production quantities 
our products often must be redesigned because manufacturing yields on prototypes are unacceptable or customers redefine their products to meet changing industry standards or customer specifications 
as a result  we develop products many years before volume production and may inaccurately anticipate our customers needs 
the complexity of our products could result in unforeseen or undetected defects or bugs  which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new products and damage our reputation with current or prospective customers 
although we  our customers and our suppliers rigorously test our products  our highly complex products may contain defects or bugs 
we have in the past experienced  and may in the future  experience defects and bugs in our products 
if any of our products contain defects or bugs  or have reliability  quality or compatibility problems that are significant to our customers  our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products 
this could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers 
in addition  these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales to our customers 
we may have to invest significant capital and other resources to alleviate problems with our products 
if any of these problems are not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product  we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall  repair or replacement costs 
these problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others 
in addition  these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts 
moreover  we would likely lose  or experience a delay in  market acceptance of the affected product or products  and we could lose credibility with our current and prospective customers 
the loss of personnel could delay us from designing new products 
to succeed  we must retain and hire technical personnel highly skilled at the design and test functions needed to develop high speed networking products 
the competition for such employees is intense 
we do not have employment agreements in place with many of our key personnel 
as employee incentives  we issue common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at the time of grant and that are subject to vesting 
as our stock price varies substantially  the stock options we grant to employees are effective as retention incentives only if they have economic value 
we may not be able to meet customer demand for our products if we do not accurately predict demand or if we fail to secure adequate wafer fabrication or assembly parts and capacity 
we currently do not have the ability to accurately predict what products our customers will need in the future 
anticipating demand is difficult because our customers face volatile pricing and demand for their end user networking equipment  our customers are focusing more on cash preservation and tighter inventory management  and because we supply a large number of products to a variety of customers and contract manufacturers who have many equipment programs for which they purchase our products 
our customers are frequently requesting shipment of our products earlier than our normal lead times 
if we do not accurately predict what mix of products our customers may order  we may not be able to meet our customers demand in a timely manner or we may be left with unwanted inventory  which could adversely affect our future operating results 
we rely on limited sources of wafer fabrication  the loss of which could delay and limit our product shipments 
we do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility 
three outside wafer foundries supply more than of our semiconductor wafer requirements 
our wafer foundry suppliers also make products for other companies and some make products for themselves  thus we may not have access to adequate capacity or certain process technologies 
we have less control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs than competitors with their own fabrication facilities 
if the wafer foundries we use are unable or unwilling to manufacture our products in required volumes  we may have to identify and qualify acceptable additional or alternative foundries 
this qualification process could take six months or longer 
we may not find sufficient capacity quickly enough  if ever  to satisfy our production requirements 
some companies that supply our customers are similarly dependent on a limited number of suppliers to produce their products 
these other companies products may be designed into the same networking equipment into which our products are designed 
our order levels could be reduced materially if these companies are unable to access sufficient production capacity to produce in volumes demanded by our customers because our customers may be forced to slow down or halt production on the equipment into which our products are designed 
we depend on third parties in asia for assembly of our semiconductor products that could delay and limit our product shipments 
subcontractors in asia assemble all of our semiconductor products into a variety of packages 
raw material shortages  political and social instability  assembly house service disruptions  currency fluctuations  or other circumstances in the region could force us to seek additional or alternative sources of supply or assembly 
this could lead to supply constraints or product delivery delays that  in turn  may result in the loss of revenues 
we have less control over delivery schedules  assembly processes  quality assurances and costs than competitors that do not outsource these tasks 
our business is vulnerable to interruption by earthquake  fire  power loss  telecommunications failure  terrorist activity and other events beyond our control 
we do not have sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for actual losses from interruption of our business that may occur  and any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are vulnerable to a major earthquake and other calamities 
we have operations in seismically active regions in california  and we rely on third party wafer fabrication facilities in seismically active regions in asia 
we have not undertaken a systematic analysis of the potential consequences to our business and financial results from a major earthquake in either region 
we are unable to predict the effects of any such event  but the effects could be seriously harmful to our business 
our estimated restructuring accruals may not be adequate 
in and  we announced and implemented plans to restructure our operations in response to the decline in demand for our networking products 
we reduced the work force and consolidated or shut down excess facilities in an effort to bring our expenses into line with our reduced revenue expectations 
while management uses all available information to estimate these restructuring costs  particularly facilities costs  our accruals may prove to be inadequate 
if our actual sublease revenues or exiting negotiations differ from our assumptions  we may have to record additional charges  which could materially affect our results of operations  financial position and cash flow 
when we account for employee stock options using the fair value method  it could significantly reduce our net income 
in december  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas revised  shared based payment which will require us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost of such award will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
we will be required to adopt this statement in the third quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact that this pronouncement will have on our financial position and results of operations but expect that it will result in significant and ongoing accounting charges 
from time to time  we become defendants in legal proceedings about which we are unable to assess our exposure and which could become significant liabilities upon judgment 
we become defendants in legal proceedings from time to time 
companies in our industry have been subject to claims related to patent infringement and product liability  as well as contract and personal claims 
we may not be able to accurately assess the risk related to these suits  and we may be unable to accurately assess our level of exposure 
these proceedings may result in material charges to our operating results in the future if our exposure is material and if our ability to assess our exposure becomes clearer 
if we cannot protect our proprietary technology  we may not be able to prevent competitors from copying our technology and selling similar products  which would harm our revenues 
to compete effectively  we must protect our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights 
we hold numerous patents and have a number of pending patent applications 
we might not succeed in attaining patents from any of our pending applications 
even if we are awarded patents  they may not provide any meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us  as they may not be of sufficient scope or strength  or may not be issued in all countries where our products can be sold 
in addition  our competitors may be able to design around our patents 
we develop  manufacture and sell our products in asian and other countries that may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
this makes piracy of our technology and products more likely 
steps we take to protect our proprietary information may not be adequate to prevent theft of our technology 
we may not be able to prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are similar to or better than ours 
our products employ technology that may infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties  which may expose us to litigation and prevent us from selling our products 
vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions characterize the semiconductor industry 
this often results in expensive and lengthy litigation 
although we have neither received any material claims relating to the infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties nor are we aware of any such potential claims  we  and our customers or suppliers  may be accused of infringing on patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties in the future 
an adverse result in any litigation could force us to pay substantial damages  stop manufacturing  using and selling the infringing products  spend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue using certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
in addition  we may not be able to develop non infringing technology  or find appropriate licenses on reasonable terms 
patent disputes in the semiconductor industry are often settled through cross licensing arrangements 
because we currently do not have a substantial portfolio of patents compared to our larger competitors  we may not be able to settle an alleged patent infringement claim through a cross licensing arrangement 
we are therefore more exposed to third party claims than some of our larger competitors and customers 
the majority of our customers are required to obtain licenses from and pay royalties to third parties for the sale of systems incorporating our semiconductor devices 
customers may also make claims against us with respect to infringement 
furthermore  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringing our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
this could consume significant resources and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  regardless of the litigation s outcome 
securities we issue to fund our operations could dilute your ownership 
we may decide to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing 
if we raise funds by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of current stockholders will be reduced and the new equity securities may have priority rights to your investment 
we may not obtain sufficient financing on terms that are favorable to you or us 
we may delay  limit or eliminate some or all of our proposed operations if adequate funds are not available 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile 
we expect that the price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate significantly  as it has in the past 
in particular  fluctuations in our stock price and our price to earnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum  hedge or day trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly  exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis 
securities class action litigation has often been instituted against a company following periods of volatility and decline in the market price of their securities 
if instituted against us  regardless of the outcome  such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management s attention and resources and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  we could incur substantial punitive and other damages relating to this litigation 
provisions in delaware law  our charter documents and our stockholder rights plan may delay or prevent another entity from acquiring us without the consent of our board of directors 
we adopted a stockholder rights plan in  pursuant to which we declared a dividend of one share purchase right for each outstanding share of common stock 
if certain events occur  including if an investor tenders for or acquires more than of our outstanding common stock  stockholders other than the acquirer may exercise their rights and receive worth of our common stock in exchange for per right  or we may  at our option  issue one share of common stock in exchange for each right  or we may redeem the rights for per right 
the issuance of the rights could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us 
in addition  our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer 
delaware law imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
although we believe these provisions of our charter documents  delaware law and our stockholder rights plan will provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion regarding our risk management activities contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
cash equivalents  short term investments and investments in bonds and notes we regularly maintain a short and long term investment portfolio of various types of government and corporate debt instruments 
our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
maturities of these instruments are less than two and one half years  with the majority being within one year 
to minimize credit risk  we diversify our investments and select minimum ratings of p or a by moody s  or a or a by standard and poor s  or equivalent 
we classify these securities as available for sale 
investments in instruments with both fixed and floating rates carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted because of a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations because of changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we were to sell securities that have declined in market value because of changes in interest rates 
we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our exposure to interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments 
based on a sensitivity analysis performed on the financial instruments held at december   that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  the impact to the fair value of our investment portfolio by a shift in the yield curve of plus or minus  or basis points would result in a decline or increase in portfolio value of approximately million  million and million respectively 
foreign currency our sales and corresponding receivables are denominated primarily in united states dollars 
we generate a significant portion of our revenues from sales to customers located outside the united states including canada  europe  the middle east and asia 
we are subject to risks typical of an international business including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by changes in these or other factors 
through our operations in canada and elsewhere outside the united states  we incur research and development  customer support costs and administrative expenses in canadian and other foreign currencies 
we are exposed  in the normal course of business  to foreign currency risks on these expenditures  particularly in canada 
in our effort to manage such risks  we have adopted a foreign currency risk management policy intended to reduce the effects of potential short term fluctuations on our operating results stemming from our exposure to these risks 
as part of this risk management  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts on behalf of our canadian subsidiary 
these forward contracts offset the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted cash flows or firm commitments 
we limit the forward contracts operational period to months or less and we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for trading purposes 
because we do not engage in foreign exchange risk management techniques beyond these periods  our cost structure is subject to long term changes in foreign exchange rates 
as at december   we had six currency forward contracts outstanding that qualified and were designated as cash flow hedges 
the us dollar notional amount of these contracts was million and the contracts had a fair value of million 
we regularly limit our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations from our canadian dollar net asset or liability positions 
we do not hedge our accruals for canadian income taxes in the ordinary course of business  and consequently in we incurred a million foreign exchange loss relating to this item 
our profitability would be materially impacted by a shift in the foreign exchange rates between united states and canadian currencies 
for example  if the value of the united states dollar decreased by relative to the canadian dollar  our profitability would decrease by million 
debt at december   million of our convertible subordinated notes were outstanding 
on january  we redeemed the remaining million of these notes for a total of million in cash  which included million in accrued interest and a million call premium
