the following discussion focuses on significant changes in the financial condition and results of operations of flag during the three years ended december  this discussion and the financial information contained herein are presented to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating the financial condition  results of operations and future prospects of flag and should be read as a supplement to and in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
executive summary changes in flag s operating performance and balance sheet continued during  leading to improvement in three primary areas earnings  balance sheet growth and credit quality 
earnings flag recorded record earnings in of million compared to million in this improvement in earnings of has numerous contributing factors  the most notable being loan growth and increases in non interest income 
net interest income improved from million in to million in flag s net interest margin remained very strong  decreasing only basis points from to 
flag s ability to maintain strong margins while building its metro atlanta franchise with growth rates of over speaks to the company s expertise in building a banking franchise that leverages customer relationships as the primary driver of its growth 
in addition  flag continues to expand lending business such that the company recorded record loan fees in of million  an increase of over levels 
non interest income improved during to million over million for the increase was due mostly to the million gain on the sale of the thomaston  georgia branch during the first quarter of flag s non interest income during was unusually high due to the refinancing opportunities that the record low interest rate environment provided for homeowners and the bank s ability to attract these mortgage loan opportunities through its mortgage division  flag mortgage 
revenues from our mortgage division decreased to million during  as refinancing activity subsided in balance sheet growth flag s total assets grew by approximately million in or 
gross loans outstanding increased by approximately million as the company continued to develop its correspondent lending line of business and further accelerated its commercial lending activities in metropolitan atlanta 
demand deposits interest bearing and non interest bearing improved by million or during while total deposits grew by million or during this increase is due principally to flag s aggressive sales efforts at attracting new customer relationships in metropolitan atlanta 
credit quality improvement in credit quality was significant as well 
non performing assets to total assets improved to at the end of compared to at the end of past due and classified loan trends also improved in the improving credit quality at flag is due largely to a comprehensive loan review program as well as efforts that focus loan production efforts in areas management believes provide higher quality credits 
net charge offs for were  compared to million for flag s provision for loan losses was million in compared to million in these levels represented and of average loans outstanding during and  respectively 
acquisition and disposition activity in december  flag purchased substantially all of the assets of payroll solutions  inc  payroll solutions a leading provider of payroll  human resources and benefits services to small and medium sized businesses primarily in georgia for approximately  including  shares of flag common stock valued at  and the assumption of debt of approximately  the purchase of payroll solutions expands the suite of services that the bank offers it business customers 
during the third quarter of  flag acquired a mortgage and construction lending practice from another atlanta based bank 
flag purchased approximately million in mortgage and construction loans and assumed several property leases with market based rents and terms 
total consideration for the purchase will be paid over the course of months and totals approximately  in cash 
the acquisition of this mortgage and construction lending practice is in accordance with flag s strategy to continue to grow its non interest income 
during the first quarter of  flag sold its thomaston  georgia branch to another georgia based bank and recorded an after tax gain of approximately million 
included in the sale was approximately  of premises and equipment   in loans and  million in deposits 
flag s decision to sell this branch was due to its continued focus on developing its banking presence where flag maintains high market share and in developing its metro atlanta presence 
critical accounting policies the accounting principles we follow and our methods of applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and with general practices within the banking industry 
in connection with the application of those principles  we have made judgments  estimates and assumptions which  in the case of the determining our allowance for loan losses all  have been critical to the determination of our financial position and results of operations 
management assesses the adequacy of the all regularly during the year  and formally prior to the end of each calendar quarter 
this assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance 
this estimation process can affect our estimated loan loss expense for a given period 
generally  the allowance for loan losses increases as the outstanding balance of loans or the level of classified or impaired loans increases 
loans or portions of loans that are deemed uncollectible are charged against and reduce the allowance 
the allowance is replenished by means of a provision for loan losses that is charged as an expense 
as a result  our estimate of the allowance for loan losses affects our earnings directly 
the all consists of two portions allocated amounts representing the potential exposures on specifically identified credits and other exposures readily predictable by historical or comparative experience  and an unallocated amount representative of inherent loss which is not readily identifiable 
even though the all is composed of two components  the entire all is available to absorb any credit losses 
allocated amounts are used on loans where management has determined that there is an increased probability or severity of loss than on the loan portfolio as a whole 
we base the allocation for these unique loans primarily on risk rating grades assigned to each of these loans as a result of our loan management and review processes 
we then assign each risk rating grade a loss ratio  which is determined based on the experience of management  discussions with banking regulators and our independent loan review process 
we estimate losses on impaired loans based on estimated cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate or based on the underlying collateral value 
to the extent that management does not believe that a certain loan s risk is appropriately represented by the risk rating grades  a specific review of the credit is performed which would result in a specific allocation for that particular loan 
unallocated amounts are particularly subjective and do not lend themselves to exact mathematical calculation 
the unallocated amount represents estimated inherent credit losses which may exist  but have not yet been identified  as of the balance sheet date 
in estimating the unallocated amount  we consider such matters as changes in the local or national economy  the depth or experience in the lending staff  any concentrations of credit in any particular industry group  and new banking laws or regulations 
after we assess applicable factors  we evaluate the aggregate unallocated amount based on our management s experience 
we then test the resulting all balance by comparing the balance in the all to historical trends and peer information 
our management then evaluates the result of the procedures performed  including the result of our testing  and concludes on the appropriateness of the balance of the all in its entirety 
the audit committee of our board of directors reviews the assessment prior to the filing of quarterly and annual financial information 
in assessing the adequacy of the all  we also rely on an ongoing independent loan review process 
we undertake this process both to ascertain whether there are loans in the portfolio whose credit quality has weakened over time and to assist in our overall evaluation of the risk characteristics of the entire loan portfolio 
our loan review process includes the judgment of management  input from our independent loan reviewer  and reviews that may have been conducted by bank regulatory agencies as part of their usual examination process 
see provision and allowance for loan losses for additional information 
results of operations flag recorded record earnings in of  or per diluted share  compared to net earnings in of  or per diluted share and a net loss in of  or per diluted share 
flag s net loss in resulted primarily from the  after tax charge taken in the first quarter to effect its management restructuring  a loss on the early repayment of federal home loan bank fhlb advances  and a larger than normal addition to the provision for loan losses 
flag recorded after tax extraordinary items related to the early repayment of fhlb advances totaling  in net interest income net interest income the difference or spread between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on borrowed funds is the largest component of flag s operating income 
flag manages net interest income in a manner that realizes the largest spread while accepting certain levels of credit  liquidity and interest rate risks 
managing these risks requires systems and processes to identify and evaluate these risks at various levels in the organization 
net interest income was million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
flag s change in net interest income during and was primarily the result of annual increases in average earning assets of and  respectively  coupled with successful efforts on holding costs on deposit growth and incremental borrowing 
flag s net interest margin net interest income divided by average earning assets decreased in to from in and in the negative impact on the net interest margin of strong competition in metro atlanta where flag expects growth rates in excess of were offset by growth in loan fees of million to million in flag has employed an aggressive growth strategy in earning assets for the last two years  attempting to leverage its existing branch network  operations structure and management team 
this strategy has resulted in double digit growth rates in earning assets in and the lower interest rate environment coupled with a very competitive market resulted in lower incremental margins than what flag has historically managed 
management is satisfied with the incremental margins on the growth in earning assets 
total interest income in was million  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
yields on average earning assets in decreased to compared to and in and  respectively 
the lower interest rate environment was the primary reason for the lower yields on earning assets 
allocation of earning assets improved during as flag was able to maintain lower relative levels of short term investments federal funds sold  interest bearing deposits in other banks and investments with maturities under days than in the past 
short term investments averaged approximately of earning assets compared to of earning assets in and in investment securities averaged approximately million during this compares to averages of million and million for and  respectively 
as a percentage of average earning assets  investment securities decreased to from in and from in this trend is due to flag s reliable lending lines of business and the rapid growth in the company s loan portfolio since early taxable equivalent yields on investment securities for were  compared to and for and  respectively 
the decrease in yields is due to the low rate environment experienced over the last few years and flag s recent investment philosophy to invest excess funds in the market in shorter maturity ranges  anticipating higher rates and better investment opportunities 
average loans outstanding including mortgage loans held for sale increased in to million  compared to average balances of million and million for and  respectively 
as a percentage of earning assets  loans outstanding averaged approximately during this continued a trend of loans comprising an increasing portion of earning assets 
loans averaged of earning assets during and during at december   flag s loans outstanding including mortgage loans held for sale totaled million  representing of earning assets 
total interest expense in increased to million  compared to million in and million in increases in related mostly to growth in average total funding of or million 
flag s efforts to improve profitability on funding through aggressive repricing continued for the first part of the year and offset the increases caused by aggressive sales efforts in metro atlanta and a rising interest rate environment in the second half of the year 
decreases in interest expense during were the results of aggressive repricing of deposit accounts in a record low interest rate environment 
flag s overall cost of funds decreased slightly during to compared to overall cost of funds of and in and  respectively 
interest expense on demand deposits money market and interest bearing checking accounts increased to million during compared to million in and million in increases in both years are the result of growth in average interest bearing demand deposit balances which have increased in and in interest expense on time deposits continued to improve during from repricing efforts that started several years ago 
yields on time deposits decreased in to compared to and in and  respectively

major sources of non interest income considered to be non recurring are the sales of branches and bank locations 
service charges on deposit accounts increased slightly in to million from million in and from million in while flag maintained strong growth in deposits during and  most of the growth came from higher balance money market and interest checking balances where customers carry balances sufficient to qualify for reduced or eliminated fees 
management believes that growth in service charges will continue at a slower pace than deposits as a whole given this dynamic 
mortgage banking activities include origination fees  service release premiums and the gain on the sale of mortgage loans originated solely for the purpose of being sold 
during  flag recorded much lower revenues from its mortgage division than in the lower interest rate environment during provided borrowers with record low rate opportunities and pushed mortgage revenues to record levels for flag and the mortgage industry 
income from mortgage banking operations was million in compared to million in and million in during the third quarter of  flag acquired a mortgage and construction lending practice from another atlanta based bank 
flag purchased approximately million in mortgage and construction loans 
flag continued to search for ways to improve the efficiency of its banking locations during this effort resulted in the sale of its thomaston  georgia branch during the first quarter of that resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
during  this effort resulted in the closure of its sandy springs office that was under lease  the relocation of the company s primary operations facility to a smaller and better designed location in jonesboro  georgia  and the sale and leaseback of its dunwoody location 
these decisions resulted in combined efficiencies of approximately non interest expenses salaries and employee benefits for were million compared to million in and million in salaries and benefits increased in as flag was able to accelerate the hiring of key relationship lenders for its growing metro atlanta franchise 
in addition  flag s acquisition of the mortgage and construction practice early in the third quarter added approximately twenty employees  most of which were lending officers 
flag also added several positions in its operations group in order to continue the high level of service to internal and external customers 
the decrease in over levels relates largely to the management restructuring undertaken in the first quarter of  in which flag took a charge related to buyouts of employment contracts and severance pay of approximately million 
excluding these charges taken in the first quarter of  flag s salary and benefits increased only  or in over the amount 
this relatively small increase in total salary and benefits during came despite an increase in total assets of in total full time equivalent employees were  and at december    and  respectively 
assets per full time equivalent were million  million and million at december    and  respectively 
occupancy expense for was million  increasing slightly from million during decreases in occupancy expense related to the divestiture of the thomaston  georgia branch were offset by increases in rent expense related to the purchase of the mortgage and construction practice during the third quarter of the decrease in over levels relates to flag s continued strategy to consolidate branches and operating locations during the past four years 
this effort has resulted in offices being closed or sold since the beginning of professional fees increased substantially in to million  an increase of  over  recorded in compliance with the new regulations relating to sarbanes oxley and the increased scrutiny on regulatory reporting cost the company approximately  during the last half of professional fees relating to business acquisitions and the divestiture of the thomaston  georgia branch amounted to approximately  for decreases in professional fees in from the level relates mostly to costs incurred in related to the management restructuring and the private placement effected in the first quarter of communications and data expense remained mostly flat during increasing only to million 
this compares to the million recorded in and the million recorded in the increase in over levels relates mostly to the company s decision to outsource both its data processing and the warehousing of most networking equipment during other operating expenses increased in to million compared to million in and million in larger amounts of other operating expenses in and relate to the divestiture and or closing of branches not included in occupancy expense 
also  for flag recorded approximately  of write downs in other real estate and incurred certain non recurring expenses relating the business acquisitions affected during the year 
for  flag incurred certain non recurring expenses relating to the management restructuring and private placement that are not reported in salary and benefits or professional fees 
investment securities the composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects management s strategy of maintaining an appropriate combination of liquidity  interest rate risk and yield 
flag seeks to maintain an investment portfolio with minimal credit risk  investing mostly in obligations of the united states treasury or other state and federal governmental agencies 
investment securities decreased during to million from million at december  at december   all investment securities outstanding were classified as available for sale 
refinancing opportunities available to homeowners in continued to cause faster than usual prepayments in mortgage backed securities 
instead of reinvesting in securities  flag chose to invest more heavily in loans as the company s metro atlanta franchise and other lending lines of business started to produce loan opportunities for the company 
flag anticipates that as rates continue to rise  better investment opportunities will present themselves and flag will be able to complement its loan growth with a growing investment portfolio 
at december   gross unrealized gains in the total portfolio amounted to million and gross unrealized losses amounted to  investment securities available for sale at december  are summarized as follows in thousands december  gross gross estimated amortized unrealized unrealized fair cost gains losses value us treasuries and agencies state  county and municipals equity securities mortgage backed securities corporate debt securities trust preferred securities at december   unrealized losses in the investment portfolio related to debt  equity and trust preferred securities 
the unrealized losses on the debt and equity securities arose due to changing interest rates and market conditions and are considered to be temporary because of acceptable investment grades where the repayment sources of principal and interest are largely backed by the us government 
at december   none of the securities issued by state and political subdivisions contained unrealized losses while out of securities issued by us government agencies and government sponsored corporations  including mortgage backed securities  contained unrealized losses 
the unrealized losses on the trust preferred securities arose due to changing interest rates and market conditions and are considered to be temporary

flag concentrates its lending activities in several areas that management believes provides adequate diversification with acceptable yield and risk levels 
these areas include  but are not limited to construction  commercial real estate  agricultural and correspondent lending lending services to other community banks

an allowance for possible losses is provided through charges to flag s earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was million in  million in  and million in flag s increase in the provision for loan losses was due to the growth in in loan balances 
flag s provision for loan losses as a percentage of average loans was  and in  and respectively 
the larger provision in was needed to replenish the allowance for loan losses due to the higher than normal amount of net charge offs experienced 
management determines the level of the provision for loan losses based on outstanding loan balances  the levels of non performing assets  and reviews of assets classified as substandard  doubtful  or loss and larger credits  together with an analysis of historical loss experience and current economic conditions 
as shown in table  the year end allowance for loan losses increased to million from million at december  flag evidenced its improving credit quality by a lower level of net charge offs for and a lower level of non performing assets 
net charge offs reached a five year low of  or of average loans outstanding for the year 
these amounts compared to net charge offs of million or for and million or for the allowance for loan losses was of gross loans at december  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is both adequate and appropriate 
however  the future level of the allowance for loan losses is highly dependent upon loan growth  loan loss experience  and other factors  which cannot be anticipated with a high degree of certainty

through this affiliation  advances totaling million were outstanding at rates competitive with other sources of funding with similar maturities 
management anticipates continued utilization of this short and long term source of funds to minimize interest rate risk and to fund growth in earning assets when profitable to do so 
during  flag repaid million in fixed rate advances from the fhlb prior to their original maturity date  incurring a prepayment penalty totaling approximately  these advances were repaid due to a falling interest rate environment in which flag could obtain new borrowings at significantly lower rates

flag did not use the line during and established the line in order to enhance the bank s liquidity ratios and preparedness 
during the first quarter of  the company formed a wholly owned connecticut statutory business trust  flag financial corporation statutory trust  a subsidiary whose sole purpose was to issue million of trust preferred securities through a pool sponsored by suntrust bank in atlanta  georgia 
the trust preferred securities have a maturity of years and are redeemable after five years with certain exceptions 
at december   the floating rate securities had a interest rate  which will reset quarterly at the three month libor rate plus 
the trust preferred securities are recorded as junior subordinated debentures on the balance sheets  but subject to certain limitations qualify for tier capital for regulatory capital purposes 
asset liability management the primary objective of flag s asset and liability management program is to control exposure to interest rate risk the exposure to changes in net interest income due to changes in market interest rates so as to enhance its earnings and protect its net worth against potential loss resulting from interest rate fluctuations 
historically  the average term to maturity or repricing rate changes of assets primarily loans and investment securities has exceeded the average repricing period of liabilities primarily deposits and borrowings 
table provides information about the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding as of december   that are expected to mature  prepay or reprice in each of the future time periods shown ie  the interest rate sensitivity 
as presented in this table  at december   the liabilities subject to rate changes within one year exceeded flag s assets subject to rate changes within one year 
flag s primary source of funding has been demand deposits interest bearing and non interest bearing instead of time deposits and wholesale borrowings with longer maturities 
this method of funding earning assets has issues concerning interest rate risk  liquidity and profitability  all of which were contemplated and measured by the company 
flag concluded that this strategy is the most profitable method of funding growth in earning assets of the company for the foreseeable future and has committed significant sales  marketing and training resources at being successful in this effort 
where interest rate risk is concerned  flag considered factors such as account size  relationship strength and historical rate levels needed to remain competitive 
generally speaking  it is the opinion of management that these deposits are less sensitive to rate movements than the earning assets they are funding 
flag uses an interest rate simulation model that uses management assumptions and theories regarding rate movements and the impact each movement will have on individual components of the balance sheet 
this approach  believed to produce more accurate results than the approach summarized in the following table  indicates that flag s balance sheet is  in fact  asset sensitive  meaning a rising rate environment would have a positive impact on flag s net interest income 
management carefully measures and monitors interest rate sensitivity and believes that its operating strategies offer protection against interest rate risk 
as required by various regulatory authorities  flag s board of directors has established an interest rate risk policy  which sets specific limits on interest rate risk exposure 
adherence to this policy is reviewed by flag s executive committee and presented at least annually to the board of directors

while the desired level of liquidity will vary depending upon a variety of factors  it is the primary goal of flag to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity in all expected economic environments 
liquidity is defined as the ability of a bank to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management involves maintaining flag s ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of the bank s customers  both depositors and borrowers 
the primary objectives of asset liability management are to provide for adequate liquidity in order to meet the needs of customers and to maintain an optimal balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities  so that flag can also meet the investment requirements of its shareholders as market interest rates change 
daily monitoring of the sources and uses of funds is necessary to maintain a position that meets both requirements 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments and the maturities and sales of securities 
mortgage loans held for sale totaled million at december   and typically turns over every days as the closed loans are sold to investors in the secondary market 
real estate construction and commercial loans that mature in one year or less amounted to million  or of the total loan portfolio at december  other short term investments such as federal funds sold are additional sources of liquidity 
the liability section of the balance sheet provides liquidity through depositors interest bearing and non interest bearing deposit accounts 
federal funds purchased  fhlb advances  other borrowings and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are additional sources of liquidity and represent flag s incremental borrowing capacity 
these sources of liquidity are short term in nature and are used as necessary to fund asset growth and meet other short term liquidity needs 
see off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations for additional information 
as disclosed in flag s consolidated statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements  net cash used in operating activities was  during the major source of cash by operating activities is net earnings during of million 
net cash used by investing activities was million and consisted primarily of an increase in net loans and the cash paid in the branch sale during the first quarter of net cash provided by financing activities was million  and consisted mostly of the growth in deposits offset to some degree by repayments of fhlb advances during in the opinion of management  flag s liquidity position at december  is sufficient to meet its expected cash flow requirements 
reference should be made to the consolidated statements of cash flows appearing in the consolidated financial statements for the three year analysis of the changes in cash and cash equivalents resulting from operating  investing and financing activities 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations flag is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments consist of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
a commitment involves  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheets 
flag s exposure to credit loss in the event of non performance by the other party to the instrument is represented by the contractual notional amount of the instrument 
since certain commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
flag uses the same credit policies in making commitments to extend credit as they do for on balance sheet instruments 
collateral held for commitments to extend credit varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant  equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
the following table summarizes flag s off balance sheet financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk as of december  and in thousands commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit the following table presents additional information about flag s contractual obligations as of december   which by their terms have maturity and termination dates subsequent to december  dollars in thousands next months months months more than months totals certificates of deposit securities sold under agreements to repurchase federal home loan bank advances minimum operating lease commitments capital resources and dividends stockholders equity at december  increased to million from million at december  this increase is the combination of several factors including a stock repurchase program that repurchased approximately million of company stock 
offsetting the impact of the stock repurchase program were net earnings of million and the issuance of million of stock relating to the purchase of payroll solutions in the fourth quarter of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia requires federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action with regard to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
as a result of fdicia  the federal banking agencies introduced an additional capital measure called the tier risk based capital ratio 
the tier ratio is the ratio of core capital to risk adjusted total assets

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation

accounting for stock based compensation  flag currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation expense for employee stock options
