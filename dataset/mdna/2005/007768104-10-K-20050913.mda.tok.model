item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we use our advanced design  engineering and manufacturing capabilities to produce microelectronic and test solutions that we sell primarily into the broadband communications  aerospace and defense markets 
we also design and manufacture motion control systems which are used for industrial and defense applications 
we have been a designer and supplier of microelectronics for more than years 
our products include i custom and standard integrated circuits  such as databuses  transceivers  microcontrollers  microprocessors and memories  and ii components  sub assemblies and modules for military and commercial communication systems 
we design  develop and manufacture a broad line of test equipment which includes wireless test equipment  frequency synthesizers  radio test equipment  synthetic test systems  avionics test equipment and other general purpose test equipment 
we also design  develop and produce motion control systems including stabilization and tracking devices  magnetic motors and scanning devices 
our operating strategy is based on the following key objectives to strengthen and expand our portfolio of proprietary technologies  to broaden the applications and target markets for our existing products  to expand the scope of our content in our customers products  to increase our operating efficiencies  to maintain a conservative capital structure  and to opportunistically pursue strategic acquisitions 
in december  our board of directors approved a formal plan to discontinue our fiber optic lithium niobate modulator operation which was acquired in march the plan called for an immediate cessation of operations and disposal of existing assets 
the abandonment of the operation resulted in a charge of million million  net of tax in the quarter ended december  the charge included a cash requirement of million  primarily for equipment leases and payroll costs  and a non cash charge of million  primarily for the write off of owned equipment 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the abandonment has been reported as a discontinued operation and  accordingly  losses from operations and the loss on abandonment have been reported separately from continuing operations 
as a result of continued operating losses  in february  our board of directors approved a plan to divest our thin film interconnect manufacturing operation mic and to seek a strategic buyer 
as a result of this decision  we recorded a million million  net of tax loss on disposal 
this charge included a cash requirement of million primarily for existing equipment leases  and a non cash charge of million for the write down of goodwill  other intangibles and owned equipment 
in accordance with sfas  we have reported the loss on disposal and the results of operations of this business as income loss from discontinued operations and all prior periods have been restated in order to conform to this presentation 
mic designed  developed  manufactured and marketed microelectronic products in the form of passive thin film circuits and interconnects 
in september  we sold the stock of mic for million and recorded an additional loss on disposal of million million  net of tax 
since the sale of the stock created a capital loss for tax purposes and we have no current capital gains to offset it  we recorded a full valuation allowance against the tax benefit 
under the terms of the sale agreement  we have retained certain liabilities relating to potential adverse environmental conditions that may exist as of the date of sale  litigation pending against mic as of the date of sale and defects in products designed  developed  manufactured or sold by mic prior to the sale date which result in a recall  withdrawal or market suspension of the product or result in injury to persons or property 
we believe these contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  our board of directors approved a formal plan to divest our shock and vibration control device manufacturing business vmc and to seek a strategic buyer 
this operation had previously comprised the isolator products segment 
in march  we sold the net assets of vmc for million in cash 
we recorded a gain on disposition of   net of tax 
under the terms of the sale agreement  we have retained certain liabilities relating to adverse environmental conditions that currently exist at the premises occupied by vmc  litigation pending against vmc as of the date of sale  and to the extent covered by insurance  product liability for products sold prior to the closing date 
we have recorded a reserve for the estimated remediation costs related to adverse environmental conditions that currently exist at the premises occupied by vmc 
in april  we acquired jcair test systems  which manufactures customized avionics test solutions  both manual and automated  for manufacturing  repair and ground support operations 
in may  we acquired the spg division of ubinetics holding limited  which is a developer  manufacturer and integrator of wireless test and measurement solutions specific to commercial wireless development organizations and service operations 
approximately of our sales for fiscal  of our sales for fiscal and of our sales for fiscal were to agencies of the united states government or to prime defense contractors or subcontractors of the united states government 
our government contracts have been awarded either on a bid basis or after negotiation 
our government contracts are primarily fixed price contracts  although we also have or had government contracts providing for cost plus fixed fee 
our government contracts have customary provisions for termination at the convenience of the government without cause 
in the event of such termination  we are generally entitled to reimbursement for our costs and to receive a reasonable profit  if any  on the work done prior to termination 
our product development efforts primarily involve engineering and design relating to developing new products  improving existing products  adapting existing products to new applications and developing prototype components to bid on specific programs 
some of our development efforts are reimbursed under contractual agreements 
product development and similar costs which are not reimbursed under contractual arrangements are expensed in the period incurred 
statement of operations the following table sets forth our net sales and operating income by business segment and a reconciliation to income from continuing operations before income taxes for the periods indicated

net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net sales in the microelectronic solutions ams segment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due primarily to the inclusion of mce  acquired in september  for a full year versus ten months in fiscal together with organic growth in mce and also as a result of increased sales of our microelectronic module and integrated circuits 
net sales in the test solutions ats segment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to increased sales in our wireless communication test products business and  to a lesser degree  sales from our recently acquired jcair and spg businesses 
gross profit 
cost of sales includes materials  direct labor and overhead expenses such as engineering labor  fringe benefits  allocable occupancy costs  depreciation and manufacturing supplies 
gross profit equals net sales less cost of sales 
fiscal year ended of of of june  ams sales ats sales total sales gross profit increased million  or  in the ams segment primarily as a result of the effect of the acquisition of mce in september  organic growth in volume of mce since last year and an increase in sales in our microelectronic modules and integrated circuits businesses 
gross profit increased million  or  in the ats segment primarily as a result of increased sales and margins in our wireless communications test products business and  to a lesser degree  our recently acquired jcair and spg businesses 
selling  general and administrative costs 
selling  general and administrative costs include office and management salaries  fringe benefits  commissions  insurance and professional fees 
fiscal year ended of of of june  ams sales ats sales corporate total sales selling  general and administrative costs increased million  or  in the ams segment due primarily to the addition of the expenses of mce for a full year versus ten months in last fiscal year and increased commissions resulting from increased sales 
selling  general and administrative costs increased million  or  in the ats segment due primarily to restructuring charges of million in our european operations  million due to the addition of the expenses of jcair and spg and million due to the full year impact of riws in fiscal versus eleven months in fiscal corporate selling  general and administrative expenses increased million due primarily to increased professional fees of million  principally related to sarbanes oxley compliance related expenses 
we initiated strategic plans to reorganize certain of our european operations in our test solutions business segment 
in connection with this restructuring  we recorded charges of million in the fiscal year ended june  for workforce reductions  primarily in management and sales 
the restructuring charge is expected to generate savings of approximately million per year 
research and development costs 
research and development costs include material  engineering labor and allocated overhead 
fiscal year ended of of of june  ams sales ats sales total sales self funded research and development costs increased million  or  in the ams segment primarily due to the increased development cost associated with field programmable gate arrays million and microelectronic modules million  and to a lesser degree  the inclusion of mce for a full year versus ten months last year million 
research and development costs increased million  or  in the ats segment primarily due to the addition of the developmental expenses for wireless communication test equipment  which is expected to continue to have higher research and development costs 
amortization of acquired intangibles 
amortization increased million  or  to million  primarily due to the acquisitions of jcair and spg 
acquired in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of spg  we allocated million of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects 
in connection with the acquisition of jcair  we allocated  of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects 
these allocations represent the estimated fair value of such incomplete research and development projects  at the acquisition date  based on future cash flows that have been adjusted by the respective projects completion percentage 
at the respective acquisition dates  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  we expensed these costs as of the respective acquisition dates in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the values assigned to these projects were determined by identifying significant research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established 
at its acquisition date  spg was conducting development activities associated with the completion of test mobile products used to test evolving g third generation mobile communications networks and equipment that tests the functionality and performance of wide band code division multiple access technology 
at its acquisition date  jcair was conducting development activities associated with the completion of the general avionic test equipment sets 
these projects under development at the valuation date represent technologies which are expected to address emerging market demands 
we intend to continue with these development efforts and  if successfully completed  release the products to market 
at its acquisition date  spg expected to spend approximately million to complete all phases of the research and development  with anticipated completion dates ranging from two to five months from that date 
at its acquisition date  jcair expected to spend approximately  to complete all phases of the research and development  with anticipated completion dates ranging from fifteen to twenty months from that date 
we determined the value assigned to purchased in process technology by estimating the contribution of the purchased in process technology in developing a commercially viable product  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the expected sales of such a product  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value using an appropriate discount rate 
revenue growth rates for the acquired companies were estimated based on a detailed forecast  as well as discussions with the finance  marketing and engineering personnel of the acquired companies 
allocation of total projected revenues to in process research and development were based on discussions with the acquired companies management 
selling  general and administrative expenses and profitability estimates were determined based on forecasts as well as an analysis of comparable companies margin expectations 
the projections utilized in the transaction pricing and purchase price allocation exclude the potential synergetic benefits related specifically to our ownership 
due to the stage of the development and reliance on future  unproven products and technologies  the nature of the forecasts and the risks associated with the projected growth and profitability of the development projects  discount rates of and assumes the contingent payment is earned were used to discount spg s cash flows from the in process technology  and was used to discount jcair s cash flows 
the discount rate was commensurate with the acquired companies market position  the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above  the inherent uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology  the useful lives of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  and the uncertainty related to technological advances that could render development stage technologies obsolete 
we believe that the foregoing assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the time of the acquisitions 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate sales  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such projects will transpire as estimated 
for these reasons  actual results may vary from projected results 
remaining development efforts for the acquired companies research and development included various phases of design  development and testing 
funding for such projects is expected to come primarily from internally generated sources 
as evidenced by the continued support of the development of these projects  we believe we have a reasonable chance of successfully completing the research and development programs 
however  as with all of our technology development  there is a risk associated with the completion of the research and development projects  and there is no assurance that technological or commercial success will be achieved 
if the development of these in process research and development projects is unsuccessful  our sales and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods 
commercial results are also subject to certain market events and risks  which are beyond our control  such as trends in technology  changes in government regulation  market size and growth  and product introduction or other actions by competitors 
other income expense 
interest expense was  in fiscal and million in fiscal other income of million in fiscal consisted primarily of million of interest income 
other expense of million in fiscal consisted primarily of million of foreign currency transaction losses partially offset by interest income of  foreign currency transaction losses decreased primarily due to foreign currency contract strategies that we employed in fiscal interest income increased primarily due to higher average levels of cash and marketable securities 
interest income is expected to decrease in fiscal as a result of our decreased cash position resulting from the use of cash for acquisitions 
interest expense decreased in fiscal due to lower borrowings 
provision for income taxes 
the income tax provision was million an effective income tax rate of in fiscal and million an effective income tax rate of in fiscal the effective income tax rate for the two periods differed from the amount computed by applying the us federal income tax rate to income before income taxes primarily due to foreign  state and local income taxes  and research and development credits and non deductible in process research and development costs 
the primary difference in rates between the two years is due to the increase in domestic income relative to foreign income and a valuation allowance recorded on foreign losses 
domestic income is taxed at higher effective tax rates than foreign income which increases the overall global tax rate 
income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations for the year ended june  was million  or 
per diluted share  versus million  or 
per diluted share  in fiscal income from continuing operations included a million charge million  net of tax  or 
per diluted share  for in process research and development related to the acquisitions of jcair and spg 
fiscal income from continuing operations included a million charge million  net of tax  or 
per diluted share for in process research and development related to the acquisitions of mce  riws and celerity 
fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  net sales 
net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net sales in the microelectronic solutions ams segment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due primarily to the acquisition of mce in september net sales in the test solutions ats segment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to the acquisition of riws in july and increased sales in our communication test products business 
gross profit 
fiscal year ended of of of june  ams sales ats sales total sales gross profit increased million  or  in the ams segment primarily as a result of the effect of the acquisition of mce in september and increased margins in our integrated circuits business due to a favorable sales mix which included more high margin standard products 
gross profit increased million  or  in the ats segment primarily as a result of the effect of the acquisition of riws in july and increased sales and margins in our communications test products business due to improved factory utilization 
selling  general and administrative costs 
fiscal year ended of of of june  ams sales ats sales corporate total sales selling  general and administrative costs increased million  or  in the ams segment due primarily to the addition of the expenses of mce 
selling  general and administrative costs increased million  or  in the ats segment due primarily to the addition of the expenses of riws and celerity 
corporate selling  general and administrative expenses increased million due primarily to increased compensation expense  professional fees and insurance expense 
research and development costs 
fiscal year ended of of of june  ams sales ats sales total sales self funded research and development costs increased million  or  in the ams segment primarily due to the addition of the expenses of mce offset  in part  by reduced expenses in our microelectronic modules business 
research and development costs increased million  or  in the ats segment primarily due to the addition of the expenses of riws  which historically had  and is expected to continue to have  higher research and development costs 
amortization of acquired intangibles 
amortization increased million  or  due to the acquisitions of mce  riws and celerity 
acquired in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of riws  we allocated million of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects 
in connection with the acquisition of mce  we allocated  of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects 
in connection with the acquisition of celerity  we allocated million of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects 
these allocations represent the estimated fair value of such incomplete research and development  at the acquisition date  based on future cash flows that have been adjusted by the respective projects completion percentage 
at the respective acquisition dates  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  we expensed these costs as of the respective acquisition dates in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
other income expense 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal other expense of million in fiscal consisted primarily of million of foreign currency transaction losses  offset by interest income of  other income of  in fiscal consisted of  of interest income partially offset by foreign currency transaction losses of  interest income decreased primarily due to lower average levels of cash and marketable securities  which were used to acquire mce  riws and celerity  and lower market interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
the income tax provision was million an effective income tax rate of in fiscal and million an effective income tax rate of in fiscal the effective income tax rate for the two periods differed from the amount computed by applying the us federal income tax rate to income before income taxes primarily due to foreign  state and local income taxes and research and development credits and  for the fiscal year ended june   non deductible in process research and development costs 
income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations for the year ended june  was million  or 
per diluted share  versus million  or 
per diluted share  in fiscal income from continuing operations included a million charge million  net of tax  or 
per diluted share  for in process research and development related to the acquisitions of mce  riws and celerity 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   we had million of working capital 
our current ratio was to at june  on february   we executed an amended and restated revolving credit and security agreement with two banks which replaced a previous loan agreement 
the amended and restated loan agreement increased the line of credit to million through february  continued the mortgage on our plainview property for million and is secured by the pledge of the stock of certain of our subsidiaries 
the interest rate on revolving credit borrowings under this agreement is at various rates depending upon certain financial ratios  with the current rate substantially equivalent to libor plus at june  
the mortgage is payable in monthly installments of approximately  through march and a balloon payment of million in april we have entered into interest rate swap agreements for the outstanding amount under the mortgage agreement at approximately in order to reduce the interest rate risk associated with these borrowings 
the terms of our loan agreement require compliance with certain covenants including minimum consolidated tangible net worth and pretax earnings  maintenance of certain financial ratios  limitations on indebtedness and prohibition of the payment of cash dividends 
we are currently in full compliance with all of the covenants contained in our loan agreement 
on july   we acquired riws for cash of million and a deferred payment of up to million in either cash or aeroflex common stock  at our option  depending on riws achieving certain performance goals for the year ending july  although we believe that the performance goals have not been met  the determination is not final 
this acquisition was funded with available cash on hand 
on september   we acquired mce for approximately million shares of aeroflex common stock 
in addition  we discharged million of mce outstanding bank debt  other indebtedness and preferred stock and issued stock options for  shares of aeroflex common stock with exercise prices ranging from to in exchange for outstanding options of mce 
on october   we acquired the business of celerity for approximately million in cash   shares of aeroflex common stock and release of certain liabilities totaling million 
on march   we completed the sale of million shares of our common stock at per share 
we received million  net of commission and expenses 
these net proceeds were used for working capital and other general corporate purposes including research and development and acquisitions 
on april   we acquired jcair for million in cash 
on may   we acquired spg for million in cash and a contingent payment of up to million in cash depending on spg achieving certain performance goals for the year ending june  in fiscal  our continuing operations provided million  primarily from our continued profitability 
in fiscal  our investing activities used cash of million principally for acquisitions million and capital expenditures million offset  in part  by net proceeds from the sale of our discontinued subsidiaries million 
in fiscal  our financing activities used million including debt repayments of million  partially offset by million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
we believe that existing cash and unused lines of credit coupled with internally generated funds will be sufficient for our working capital requirements  capital expenditure needs and the servicing of our debt for the foreseeable future 
our cash and lines of credit are available to fund acquisitions and other potential large cash needs that may arise 
at june   our available unused line of credit was million after consideration of letters of credit 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our obligations and commitments to make future payments under debt  operating leases  and employment contracts as of june  payments due by period less than after total year years years years in thousands long term debt operating leases employment contracts total the operating lease commitments shown in the above table have not been reduced by future minimum sub lease rentals of million 
in the normal course of business  we routinely enter into binding and non binding purchase obligations primarily covering anticipated purchases of inventory and equipment 
none of these obligations are individually significant 
we do not expect that these commitments as of june  will materially adversely affect our liquidity 
legal proceedings we are involved in various routine legal matters 
we believe the outcome of these matters will not have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the registrant recently has learned that it inadvertently may have violated certain international traffic in arms regulations itar by exporting certain products and services without licenses 
these exports resulted from an error in classifying the products and services as commercial rather than military 
the registrant has prepared and filed a voluntary disclosure with the state department in which the details of the exports and erroneous classifications are described 
at this time  it is not possible to determine whether any fines or other penalties will be asserted against the registrant  or the materiality of any outcome 
we are undergoing routine audits by taxing authorities of our state income tax returns covering periods from to we believe that the probable outcome of these various audits should not materially affect our consolidated financial statements 
backlog our backlog of orders was million at june  and million at june  accounting policies involving significant estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the recognition of revenue and expenses during the period reported 
the following accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions based on the circumstances  information available and our experience and judgment 
these estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
if actual results differ significantly from our estimates  our financial statements could be materially impacted 
revenue and cost recognition under long term contracts we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for arrangements other than certain long term contracts  revenue including shipping and handling fees is recognized when products are shipped and title is passed to the customer 
if title does not pass until the product reaches the customer s delivery site  the recognition of revenue is deferred until that time 
revenues associated with certain long term contracts are recognized in accordance with statement of position no 
accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
under sop  we use the percentage of completion method  whereby revenues and associated costs are recognized as work on a contract progresses 
we measure the extent of progress toward completion generally based upon one of the following based upon an assessment of which method most closely aligns to the underlying earnings process i the units of delivery method  ii the cost to cost method  using the ratio of contract costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs at contract completion based upon engineering and production estimates  or iii the achievement of contractual milestones 
provisions for anticipated losses or revisions in estimated profits on contracts in process are recorded in the period in which such anticipated losses or revisions become evident 
revenue from software support and maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition 
certain of our sales are to distributors which have a right to return some portion of product within eighteen months of sale 
we recognize revenue on these sales at the time of shipment to the distributor as these sales meet all of the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
historically  the returns under these arrangements have been insignificant and can be reasonably estimated 
an estimate of such returns is recorded at the time sales are recognized 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
inventory levels are maintained in relation to the expected sales volume 
we periodically evaluate the net realizable value of our inventory 
numerous analyses are applied including lower of cost or market analysis  forecasted consideration  such as technological changes  age and physical condition  appropriate adjustments are recorded to the inventory balance 
if actual conditions differ from our expectations  then inventory balances may be over or under valued  which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
recoverability of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill property  plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease  including anticipated renewals  or the estimated life of the asset  whichever is shorter 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business model can result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates 
to the extent the estimated useful lives are incorrect  the value of these assets may be over or under stated  which in turn could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
long lived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment not less than annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of any such asset may be impaired 
we evaluate the recoverability of such assets by estimating future cash flows 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we will recognize an impairment loss to the extent of the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over the discounted cash flow 
sfas no 
requires that we perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired on an annual basis unless events or circumstances warrant a more frequent assessment 
the impairment assessment involves  among other things  an estimation of the fair value of each of our reporting units as defined in sfas no 

such estimations are inherently subjective  and subject to change in future periods 
if the impairment review of goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets differs significantly from actual results  it could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
restructuring charges when we incur a liability related to a restructuring charge  we estimate and record all appropriate expenses 
these expenses include severance  retention bonuses  fringe benefits  asset impairment  buyout of leases and inventory write downs 
to the extent that our estimates differ from actual expenses  there could be significant additional expenses or reversals of previously recorded charges in the future 
income taxes the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
if this assumption changes in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in our consolidated statement of operations 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance quarterly 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements  transactions  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations 
risks relating to our business general economic conditions could adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and expenses 
our revenues and gross margins will depend significantly on the overall demand for microelectronic products and testing solutions  particularly in the product and service segments in which we compete 
weaker demand for our products and services caused by economic weakness may result in decreased revenues  earnings levels or growth rates and problems with the saleability of inventory and realizability of customer receivables 
in the past  we have observed effects of the global economic downturn in many areas of our business 
delays or reductions in spending for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
our sales and other operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past  and we expect this trend will continue 
factors which affect our results include the timing  cancellation or rescheduling of customer estimates  orders and shipments  the pricing and mix of products sold  new product introductions  our ability to obtain components and subassemblies from contract manufacturers and suppliers  and variations in manufacturing efficiencies 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
our performance in any one fiscal quarter is not necessarily indicative of any financial trends or future performance 
in the event that any of our customers encounter financial difficulties and fail to pay us  it could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we manufacture products to customer specifications and purchase products in response to customer orders 
in addition  we may commit significant amounts to maintain inventory in anticipation of customer orders 
in the event that any customer  for whom we maintain inventory  experiences financial difficulties  we may be unable to sell such inventory at its current profit margin  if at all 
in such an event  our gross margins would decline 
in addition  if the financial condition of any customer deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of that customer s ability to pay us amounts owed in respect of a significant amount of outstanding receivables  our financial condition would be adversely affected 
if we cannot continue to develop  manufacture and market innovative products and services rapidly that meet customer requirements for performance and reliability  we may lose market share and our revenues may suffer 
the process of developing new high technology products and services is complex and uncertain  and failure to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately and to develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property could significantly harm our results of operations 
we must make long term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will eventually result in products that the market will accept 
we must accurately forecast volumes  mix of products and configurations that meet customer requirements  and we may not succeed 
due to the international nature of our business  political or economic changes could harm our future revenues  costs and expenses and financial condition 
our future revenues  costs and expenses could be adversely affected by a variety of international factors  including changes in a country s or region s political or economic conditions  longer accounts receivable cycles  trade protection measures  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  differing technology standards and or customer requirements  and import or export licensing requirements  which could affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components or lead to penalties or restrictions 
a portion of our product and component manufacturing  along with key suppliers  is located outside of the united states  and also could be disrupted by some of the international factors described above 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks that could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks that are inherent in our sales commitments  anticipated sales  and assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
failure to sufficiently hedge or otherwise manage foreign currency risks properly could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
as part of our business strategy  we may complete acquisitions or divest non strategic businesses and product lines 
these actions could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
as part of our business strategy  we engage in discussions with third parties regarding  and enter into agreements relating to  possible acquisitions  strategic alliances  ventures and divestitures in order to manage our product and technology portfolios and further our strategic objectives 
in order to pursue this strategy successfully  we must identify suitable acquisition  alliance or divesture candidates  complete these transactions  some of which may be large and complex  and integrate acquired companies 
integration and other risks of acquisitions and strategic alliances can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions  or if multiple acquisitions are pursued simultaneously 
the integration of our recent acquisitions of jcair and spg may make the completion and integration of subsequent acquisitions more difficult 
however  if we fail to identify and complete these transactions  we may be required to expend resources to internally develop products and technology or may be at a competitive disadvantage or may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions  which may have a material effect on our revenues and selling  general and administrative expenses taken as a whole 
acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate with a different company culture  management team and business infrastructure and otherwise manage integration risks 
even if an acquisition or alliance is successfully integrated  we may not receive the expected benefits of the transaction 
managing acquisitions  alliances and divestitures requires varying levels of management resources  which may divert management s attention from the other business operations 
acquisitions  including abandoned acquisitions  also may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings 
as a result  any completed  pending or future transactions may contribute to our financial results differing from the investment community s expectations in a given quarter 
in order to be successful  we must retain and motivate key employees  and failure to do so could seriously harm us 
in order to be successful  we must retain and motivate executives and other key employees  including those in managerial  technical  marketing and information technology support positions 
in particular  our product generation efforts depend on hiring and retaining qualified engineers 
attracting and retaining skilled workers and qualified sales representatives is also critical to us 
experienced management and technical  marketing and support personnel in the microelectronics and test solutions industries are in demand and competition for their talents is intense 
employee retention may be a particularly challenging issue following our recent acquisitions since we also must continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals  which may be particularly difficult due to the potential distractions related to integrating the acquired operations 
terrorist acts or acts of war may seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
terrorist acts or acts of war wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to us  our employees  facilities  partners  suppliers  distributors and resellers  and customers  which could significantly impact our revenues  expenses and financial condition 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
in addition  as a company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states  we may be impacted by actions against the united states 
we will be predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts or acts of war 
our stock price has historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate 
our stock price  like that of other technology companies  can be volatile 
some of the factors that can affect our stock price are the announcement of new products  services or technological innovations by us or our competitors  quarterly increases or decreases in our revenue or earnings  changes in quarterly revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community  and speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position  financial condition  results of operations  business or significant transactions 
general market conditions and domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to our performance may also affect our stock price 
in addition  following periods of volatility in a registrant s securities  securities class action litigation against a registrant is sometimes instituted 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and to foreign currency exchange rates 
most of our debt is at fixed rates of interest or at a variable rate with an interest rate swap agreement which effectively converts the variable rate debt into fixed rate debt 
therefore  if market interest rates increase by from levels at june   the effect on our net income as well as the fair value of our swap would be insignificant 
most of our invested cash and cash equivalents are at variable rates of interest 
if market interest rates decrease by percent from levels at june   the effect on our net income would be insignificant 
if foreign currency exchange rates primarily the british pound and the euro change by from levels at june   the effect on our other comprehensive income would be approximately million 
foreign currency contracts are used to protect the registrant from fluctuations in exchange rates 
the registrant periodically enters into foreign currency contracts  which are not designated as hedges  and the change in fair value is included in income currently  within other income expense 
as of june   the registrant had million of notional value foreign currency forward contracts maturing through september notional amounts do not quantify risk or represent assets or liabilities of the registrant  but are used in the calculation of cash settlements under the contracts 
the fair value of these contracts at june  was  less than the notional value
