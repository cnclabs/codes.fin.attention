item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provided under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
restatement of prior financial information during the course of reviewing its accounting practices with respect to leasing transactions  the company discovered certain errors relating to accounting for leases  restructuring expense  leasehold improvements and other related matters 
on february   company management and the audit committee of the board of directors concluded that the company s historical financial statements for the years ended december  and should be restated 
management assessed the impact of each of the resulting errors on the historical financial statements individually and in the aggregate and concluded that it was necessary to restate the company s financial statements for all periods effected by the errors 
as a result  the company restated its consolidated financial statements as of december  and for the years ended december  and the december  financial statements also include the cumulative effect of the restatement as of january  straight line rent and restructuring management reviewed all facility lease agreements and identified leases that included periods of free rent  specific escalating lease payments  or both 
historically  the company recorded rent expense based upon scheduled rent payments  rather than on a straight line basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for leases  financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin ftb no 
 issues relating to accounting for leases and other relevant accounting literature 
included in the total were leases entered into in or prior thereto 
in the process of correcting for straight line rent  the company identified three leases for which a restructuring charge had been recorded in that erroneously had period rental expense charged against the restructuring liability rather than through current operations 
in addition  the company determined the restructuring charge previously recorded in was overstated as a result of deferred rent not previously recognized on leases that were restructured 
additionally  the restructuring benefit recorded in related to a lease coming out of restructuring that was overstated as a result of deferred rent not previously recognized 
the company has also corrected this item to properly reflect the restructuring charge 
the effect of these corrections increased the net loss as follows in thousands  except for per share amounts year ended december  straight line rent rent expense improperly charged to restructuring reserve reduction in restructuring benefit due to straight line rentals total increase in basic and diluted net loss per share lease classification one of the company s facility leases for a data center contained an additional lease payment representing a charge for electrical infrastructure integral to the building that the company occupied 
the company incorrectly identified this additional payment as a separate capital lease of leasehold improvements rather than as an additional payment related to the data center space 
the effect of recording the electrical infrastructure as an operating lease reduced the net loss by million  or less than per share  for each of the years ended december  and leasehold improvements in connection with reviewing lease agreements and related lease terms  management determined that leasehold improvements for locations were being amortized beyond the lease term 
in some cases  leases were no longer in force and the sites had been abandoned  yet the leasehold improvements had not been written off  but rather continued to be amortized 
the effect of correcting the amortizable life of the assets and writing off abandoned leasehold improvements increased the net loss for the year ended december  by million  or less than per share  and for the year ended december  by million  or approximately per share 
other undepreciated assets management also identified million of property and equipment for which depreciation had never been recorded 
the impact of recording depreciation expense on these assets was to increase the net loss before income taxes by million  or less than per share  for each of the years ended december  and the cumulative effect of the adjustments for all years prior to was million  which was recorded as an adjustment to opening stockholders equity at january  the resulting adjustments were all non cash and had no impact on the company s total cash flows  cash position or revenues 
overview we provide high performance  managed internet connectivity solutions to business customers who require guaranteed network availability and high performance levels for business critical applications  such as e commerce  video and audio streaming  voice over internet protocol  virtual private networks and supply chain management 
at december   we delivered services through our network access points in metropolitan market areas which feature multiple direct high speed connections to major internet networks 
our proprietary route optimization technology monitors the performance of these internet networks and allows us to intelligently route our customers internet traffic over the optimal internet path in a way that minimizes data loss and network delay 
we believe this approach provides better performance  control  predictability and reliability than conventional internet connectivity providers 
our service level agreements guarantee performance across the entire internet in the united states  excluding local connections  whereas conventional internet connectivity providers typically only guarantee performance on their own network 
we provide services to customers in various industry verticals  including financial services  entertainment and media  travel  e commerce and retail and technology 
as of december   we provided our services to more than  customers in the united states and abroad 
due to the nature of the services we provide  we generally price our internet connectivity services at a premium to the services offered by conventional internet connectivity service providers 
we believe customers with business critical internet applications will continue to demand the highest quality of service as their internet connectivity needs grow and become even more complex and  as such  will continue to pay a premium for our high performance managed internet connectivity services 
our success in executing our premium pricing strategy depends  to a significant degree  on our ability to differentiate our connectivity solutions from lower cost alternatives 
the key measures of our success in achieving this differentiation are revenue and customer growth 
during  we added approximately net new customers  bringing our total to over  enterprise customers as of december  revenue for the year ended december  increased to million  compared to revenue of million for the year ended december  we intend to increase revenue by leveraging the capabilities of our existing network access points 
in our existing markets  we realize incremental margin as new customers are added 
additional volume in an existing market allows improved utilization of existing facilities and an improved ability to cost effectively predict and acquire additional network capacity 
conversely  decreases in the number of customers in an established market lead to decreased facility utilization and increase the possibility that direct network resources are not cost efficiently employed 
these factors have a direct bearing on our financial position and results of operations 
we also intend to increase revenue by expanding our geographic coverage in key markets in the united states and abroad 
as we enter new geographic markets  operating results will be affected by increased expense for hiring  training and managing new employees  acquiring and implementing new systems and expense for new facilities 
our ability to generate increased revenue depends on the success of our cost control measures as we expand our geographic coverage 
finally  we intend to increase revenue by expanding our complementary managed internet service product offerings 
these services include  but are not limited to  content distribution  virtual private networking  colocation services  managed security  managed storage  video conferencing and voice over internet protocol services 
business combinations on october   we completed our acquisition of netvmg 
the acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
the aggregate purchase price of the acquired company  plus related charges  was million and was comprised of  shares of our series a preferred stock  acquisition costs and warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock 
on october   we completed our acquisition of sockeye 
the acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting under sfas no 
the aggregate purchase price of the acquired company  plus related charges  was million and was comprised of million shares of our common stock and acquisition costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expense  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  customer credit risk  cost and equity basis investments  goodwill and other intangible assets  long lived assets  income taxes  restructuring costs  long term service contracts  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the majority of our revenue is derived from high performance internet connectivity and related colocation services 
our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of internet connectivity services at fixed rates or usage based pricing to our customers that desire a ds or faster connection and other ancillary services  such as colocation  content distribution  server management and installation services  virtual private networking services  managed security services  data backup  remote storage and restoration services  and video conferencing services 
we also offer t and fractional ds connections at fixed rates 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service has been provided  the fees for the service rendered are fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
contracts and sales or purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
we test for availability or use shipping documents when applicable to verify delivery of our product or service 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
deferred revenue consists of revenue for services to be delivered in the future and consist primarily of advance billings  which are amortized over the respective service period 
revenue associated with billings for installation of customer network equipment are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the customer relationship  as the installation service is integral to our primary service offering and does not have value to a customer on a stand alone basis generally two years 
deferred post contract customer support pcs associated with sales of our flow control platform solution and similar products are amortized ratably over the contract period generally one year 
customer credit risk 
we routinely review the creditworthiness of our customers 
if we determine that collection of service revenue is uncertain  we do not recognize revenue until cash has been collected 
additionally  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments on accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon specific and general customer information  which also includes estimates based on management s best understanding of our customers ability to pay 
customers ability to pay takes into consideration payment history  legal status ie  bankruptcy  and the status of services being provided by the company 
once all collection efforts have been exhausted  we write the uncollectible balance off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also estimate a reserve for sales adjustments  which reduces net accounts receivable and revenue 
the reserve for sales adjustments is based upon specific and general customer information  including outstanding promotional credits  customer disputes  credit adjustments not yet processed through the billing system and historical activity 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  or management becomes aware of new information impacting a customer s credit risk  additional allowances may be required 
accounting for leases and leasehold improvements 
we record leases as capital or operating leases and account for leasehold improvements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases and related literature 
rent expense for operating leases is recorded in accordance with ftb no 
 issues relating to accounting for leases 
this ftb requires lease agreements that include periods of free rent  specific escalating lease payments  or both  to be recorded on a straight line or other systematic basis over the initial lease term and those renewal periods that are reasonably assured 
the difference between rent expense and rent paid is recorded as deferred rent in non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
investments 
we account for investments without readily determinable fair values at historical cost  as determined by our initial investment 
the recorded value of cost basis investments is periodically reviewed to determine the propriety of the recorded basis 
when a decline in the value that is judged to be other than temporary has occurred  based on available data  the cost basis is reduced and an investment loss is recorded 
we have a million equity investment at december  in aventail corporation aventail  an early stage  privately held company  after having reduced the balance for an impairment loss of million in the carrying value of our investment in aventail is recorded in non current investments in our consolidated balance sheet 
we account for investments that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over an investee using the equity method of accounting 
significant influence  but not control  is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee of between and  although other factors  such as minority interest protections  are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate 
as of december   we have a single investment that qualifies for equity method accounting  our joint venture with ntt me corporation of japan  known as internap japan 
we record our proportional share of the losses of our investee one month in arrears on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of non current investments and our share of the investee s losses as loss on investment on the consolidated statement of operations 
investments in marketable securities include high credit quality corporate debt securities and u 
s government agency debt securities 
these investments are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in other comprehensive income 
goodwill 
we may record goodwill as a result of acquisitions 
we recorded goodwill as a result of our acquisitions of co space  inc  vpnx 
com  inc  netvmg  inc  and sockeye networks  inc 
we account for goodwill under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement requires an impairment only approach to accounting for goodwill 
the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model is a two step process 
first  it requires a comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations that have goodwill assigned to them 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in this process  a fair value for goodwill is estimated  based in part on the fair value of the operations used in the first step  and is compared to the carrying value for goodwill 
any shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
sfas no 
requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually at the same time every year and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist 
we selected august as our annual testing date 
to assist us in estimating the fair value for purposes of completing the first step of the sfas no 
analysis  we engaged a professional business valuation and appraisal firm who utilized discounted cash flow valuation methods and the guideline company method for reasonableness 
the forecasts of future cash flows was based on our best estimate of future revenue  operating costs and general market conditions  and was subject to review and approval by senior management 
both approaches to determining fair value depend on our stock price since market capitalization will impact the discount rate to be applied as well as a market multiple analyses 
changes in the forecast could cause us to either pass or fail the first step test and could result in the impairment of goodwill 
restructuring liability 
when circumstances warrant  we may elect to exit certain business activities or change the manner in which we conduct ongoing operations 
when such a change is made  management will estimate the costs to exit a business or restructure ongoing operations 
the components of the estimates may include estimates and assumptions regarding the timing and costs of future events and activities that represent management s best expectations based on known facts and circumstances at the time of estimation 
management periodically reviews its restructuring estimates and assumptions relative to new information  if any  of which it becomes aware 
should circumstances warrant  management will adjust its previous estimates to reflect what it then believes to be a more accurate representation of expected future costs 
because management s estimates and assumptions regarding restructuring costs include probabilities of future events  such estimates are inherently vulnerable to changes due to unforeseen circumstances  changes in market conditions  regulatory changes  changes in existing business practices and other circumstances that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
a change in our restructuring estimates in a future period  compared to the million restructuring liability at december  would result in an million expense or benefit in the statement of operations during the period in which the change in estimate occurred 
deferred taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
since inception we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to our net deferred tax assets 
although we consider the potential for future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we determine we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is known as sfas no 
r and replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
among other things  sfas no 
r eliminates the alternative to use the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r requires public entities to recognize compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of the awards 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r on july  using the modified prospective application 
accordingly  we will recognize compensation expense for all newly granted awards and awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after july  compensation cost for the unvested portion of awards that are outstanding as of july  will be recognized ratably over the remaining vesting period 
the compensation cost for the unvested portion of the awards will be based on the fair value at the date of grant  similar to calculations for our pro forma disclosure under sfas no 
based on our current employee stock purchase plan  we will recognize compensation expense beginning with the july  purchase period 
we estimate that the effect on net income or loss and income or loss per share in the periods following adoption of sfas no 
r will be consistent with our pro forma disclosure under sfas no 
 except that estimated forfeitures will be considered in the calculation of compensation expense under sfas no 
r 
if we had previously used the fair value method of accounting for stock options granted to employees using the black scholes option valuation methodology  our net loss would have been million greater than reported in the year ended december  and million greater than reported in the year ended december  however  the actual effect on net income or loss and earnings or loss per share after adopting sfas no 
r will vary depending upon the number of options granted in compared to prior years and the number of shares purchased under the employee stock purchase plan 
further  we have not yet determined the actual model we will use to calculate fair value 
results of operations our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of internet connectivity services at fixed rates or usage based pricing to our customers that desire a ds or faster connection 
we also offer t and fractional ds connections at fixed rates 
in addition to our connectivity services  we also provide premised based hardware and software route optimization products and other ancillary services  such as colocation  content distribution  server management and installation services  virtual private networking services  managed security services  data backup  remote storage and restoration services and video conferencing 
direct cost of revenue is comprised primarily of the costs for connecting to and accessing internet network service providers and competitive local exchange providers  costs related to operating and maintaining network access points and data centers  costs incurred for providing additional third party services to our customers and costs of flow control platform solution and similar products sold 
to the extent a network access point is located a distance from the respective internet network service providers  we may incur additional local loop charges on a recurring basis 
connectivity costs vary depending on customer demands and pricing variables while network access point facility costs are generally fixed in nature 
direct cost of revenue does not include depreciation or amortization 
customer support costs consist primarily of employee compensation costs for employees engaged in connecting customers to our network  installing customer equipment into network access point facilities  and servicing customers through our network operations centers 
in addition  facilities costs associated with the network operations center are included in customer support costs 
product development costs consist principally of compensation and other personnel costs  consultant fees and prototype costs related to the design  development and testing of our proprietary technology  enhancement of our network management software and development of internal systems 
costs associated with internal use software are capitalized when the software enters the application development stage until implementation of the software has been completed 
costs for software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed are capitalized upon establishing technological feasibility and ending when the software is available for general release to customers 
all other product development costs are expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing costs consist of compensation  commissions and other costs for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and field service support functions  as well as advertising  tradeshows  direct response programs  new service point launch events  management of our web site and other promotional costs 
general and administrative costs consist primarily of compensation and other expense for executive  finance  human resources and administrative personnel  professional fees and other general corporate costs 
the revenue and income potential of our business and market is unproven  and our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects 
although we have been in existence since  we have incurred significant operational restructurings in recent years  which have included substantial changes in our senior management team  a reduction in headcount from a high of employees to employees at december   streamlining our cost structure  consolidating network access points  terminating certain non strategic real estate leases and license arrangements and moving our corporate office from seattle  washington to atlanta  georgia to further reduce costs 
we have incurred net losses in each quarterly and annual period since we began operations in may as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
the following table sets forth  as a percentage of total revenue  selected statement of operations data for the periods indicated year ended december  restated restated revenue costs and expense direct cost of revenue  exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below customer support product development sales and marketing general and administrative depreciation and amortization amortization of other intangible assets pre acquisition liability adjustment restructuring costs benefit loss on disposals of property and equipment total operating costs and expense loss from operations total other expense  net net loss years ended december  and revenue 
revenue for increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
our largest increase in revenue came from colocation services  which increased million  or  to million for compared to million for and our edge appliance products contributed million of revenue for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
content distribution services revenue also increased to million in from million in  a change of million or 
revenue for internet protocol connectivity services increased slightly to million from million for the years ended december  and  respectively  in spite of continued industry wide intense pricing pressures 
we experienced a decrease in non recurring and other revenue of million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  non recurring and other revenue includes termination fees and service revenue from virtual private network vpn  managed security  managing customer premise equipment mcpe  and data storage services 
the million decrease in non recurring and other revenue is primarily represented by deferred termination revenue recognized throughout that concluded during the quarter ended march  these overall increases in revenue were primarily due to an increase in our customer base of approximately customers  a increase 
while our customer base grew from a year ago  revenue per customer decreased due to price reductions in charges for our internet connectivity services necessitated by general market conditions 
we expect the composition of any future revenue increases will include an increasing percentage of revenue from non connectivity products and services than in the past  particularly from the sale of our edge appliance technology  which includes our flow control platform solution 
direct cost of revenue 
direct cost of revenue decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of 
for the year ended december   our revenue less direct cost of revenue improved to million compared to million for the same period in this increase is a result of our leveraging of fixed colocation and other service point facility costs over an increased customer base and negotiating lower rates with service providers 
the decrease of million in direct cost of revenues was due to reduced network service provider costs and lower local loop pass through costs of million 
off setting the decrease in network service provider costs and lower local loop pass through costs were an increase in colocation services expense of million due to the increased usage of these services by our customers  along with increases in channel  technology  and preferred colocation partner product cost of million 
an additional increase of million in direct cost of revenue is attributed to resale of network equipment  resulting from acquisitions completed by us in  along with an increase of million pertaining to facilities costs 
connectivity costs vary based upon customer traffic and other demand based pricing variables and are expected to continue to decrease during  even with modest revenue growth  due to the full year effect of pricing improvements negotiated during content delivery network and other costs associated with reseller arrangements are generally variable in nature 
we expect these costs to continue to increase during as revenue increases 
customer support 
customer support expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase of million was primarily driven by compensation and benefits of million for higher staffing levels  along with decreases of million in communications 
product development 
product development costs for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the net decrease of million primarily reflects the redeployment of technical resources from product support to network support in general and administrative expense offset by new hiring for other responsibilities 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing costs for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  this increase of million was primarily due to an increase in quota bearing resources as well as the commensurate expenses associated with the new hires 
a portion of these increases can also be attributed to increased training and productivity improvements 
general and administrative 
general and administrative costs for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  the increase of million primarily reflects increases of million outside professional services  million in office equipment repairs and maintenance  million in employee compensation  million in tax  license  and fees and million in communications costs 
consulting and outside professional services principally include compliance costs related to the sarbanes oxley act of also included in the increase is the million from redeployment of certain technical resources from product development to network support 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization  including other intangible assets  for the year ended december  decreased to million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was primarily due to assets becoming fully depreciated during  which were not replaced by the same level of purchases of property and equipment as during prior years 
restructuring cost benefit 
we incurred additional restructuring costs of million during the year as a result of a comprehensive analysis of the remaining accrued restructuring liability 
during the quarter ended september   a new sublease was negotiated on one abandoned property and new terms involving a reconfiguration of usable and abandoned space were negotiated with the lessor on another abandoned property  both of which were included in the original restructuring 
the last of our restructured network infrastructure obligations was also terminated during the quarter ended september  the net charge to restructuring resulted from an increase of million relating to real estate obligations offset by a reduction of million pertaining to network infrastructure and other obligations 
after reviewing the current analysis in the third quarter of  management concluded that the facilities remaining in the restructuring accrual are taking longer than expected to sublease and those that were subleased resulted in lower than expected sublease rates 
consequently  the currently projected obligations exceeded the unadjusted liability by million over the remaining lease terms  with the last commitment expiring in july all of these leases arose from the company s acquisition of co space 
the network infrastructure obligations represented amounts to be incurred under contractual obligations in existence at the time the restructuring plan was initiated 
during the quarter ended september   all other remaining contractual obligations for network infrastructure and other costs included in the restructuring were satisfied and we reduced the remaining recorded liability for the obligations from million to zero 
restructuring costs were million for reflecting non cash restructuring plan adjustments and write downs net of additional restructuring and impairment charges 
other expense  net 
other expense  net consists of interest income  interest and financing expense  investment losses and other non operating expense 
other expense  net for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease is due primarily to million less interest expense from carrying less debt than in the prior year 
years ended december  and revenue 
revenue for increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
revenue for internet protocol connectivity and third party services at our existing network access points increased primarily due to the addition of approximately  for a total of approximately  a increase 
pricing pressures due to general market conditions caused a decrease in our revenue per customer 
revenue from complementary managed internet services  such as content distribution  increased excluding the revenue from the acquisition of netvmg 
revenue for reflects the addition of netvmg operations subsequent to its acquisition in the fourth quarter 
we expect the composition of future revenue increases will include an increasing percentage of revenue from complementary managed internet services than in the past 
direct cost of revenue 
direct cost of revenue decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease of million was primarily due to a reduction in negotiated rates with internet network service and local exchange providers throughout the decrease was partially offset by a increase in content distribution costs  which were in line with the increase in content distribution revenue 
facility costs comprise approximately one third of total direct network costs 
late in  we consolidated facilities from to  reducing costs 
the resulting lower facilities costs are expected to be stable in future years with incremental increases directly related to expansion into new metropolitan market areas 
the remaining direct network cost is anticipated to maintain a similar relationship with revenue 
customer support 
customer support expense decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease of million was primarily driven by decreases in employee compensation costs of million due to a headcount reduction of approximately employees and decreased facilities costs of million  along with a million decrease in communications costs 
product development 
product development costs for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was due primarily to decreased facilities costs of million 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase of million in employee benefits 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing costs for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  this decrease of million was primarily due to a decrease of million in employee compensation costs due to a headcount reduction of approximately employees 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in market research expenditures and a million increase in outside professional services 
general and administrative 
general and administrative costs for the year ended december  decreased million or to million from million for the year ended december  changes in components of general and administrative expense include decreased employee compensation expense of million due to a headcount reduction of approximately employees  a million decrease in outside professional services  a million decrease in tax  license  and fees 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in insurance and administration fees 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment for the year ended december  decreased to million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was primarily due to assets becoming fully depreciated during  which were not replaced by the same level of purchases of property and equipment as during prior years 
amortization of other intangible assets for the year ended december  decreased to million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was due to intangible assets becoming fully amortized during  which was only partially offset by amortization expense for the additional intangible assets related to the netvmg acquisition during pre acquisition liability adjustment 
as part of our acquisition of co space on june   we recorded a pre acquisition liability of million for network equipment purchased by co space 
during  we reevaluated the likelihood of settling the liability related to this equipment and concluded that a contingent obligation no longer exists 
therefore  the liability was eliminated resulting in a one time reduction in costs and expense of million 
restructuring cost benefit 
a restructuring charge of million was recorded in for costs associated with the relocation of our corporate office to atlanta  georgia 
this compares with a restructuring benefit of million in reflecting non cash restructuring plan adjustments and write downs net of additional restructuring and impairment charges 
other expense  net 
other expense  net consists of interest and financing expense  interest income  investment income and losses and other non operating expense 
other expense  net for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  the increase of million is primarily attributed to less interest income during the year 
deemed dividend related to beneficial conversion feature 
our net loss per share includes the effect of a deemed dividend of million related to certain conversion features of our series a preferred stock in in august  we completed a private placement of our common stock which resulted in a decrease of the conversion price of our series a preferred stock to per share and an increase in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of all shares of series a preferred stock by million shares 
we recorded a deemed dividend of million in connection with the conversion price adjustment  which is attributable to the additional incremental number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our series a preferred stock 
see note to our financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow for the years ended december    and net cash from operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   and was primarily due to the net loss of million adjusted for non cash items of million offset by changes in working capital items of million 
the changes in working capital items include net use of cash for accounts receivable of million  deferred revenue of million  and accrued liabilities of million 
these were offset by net sources of cash in inventory  prepaid expense and other assets of million  accounts payable of million and accrued restructuring costs of million 
the increase in receivables at december  compared to december  was related to the increase in revenue compared to the prior year as day s sales outstanding increased to from days 
the increase in payables is primarily related to more stringent cash controls in compared to net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   and was primarily due to the net loss of million adjusted for non cash items of million  offset by net uses of cash for accrued restructuring costs of million  accounts payable of million  deferred revenue of million  accounts receivable of million and accrued liabilities of million 
these uses of cash were offset by a million decrease in inventory  prepaid expense and other assets 
the increase in receivables at december  compared to december  was related to the increase in revenue compared to the prior year as day s sales outstanding remained constant at days 
the decrease in payables is primarily related to a lower overall level of operating expense in compared to net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   and was primarily due to the net loss of million adjusted for non cash items of million  offset by net uses of cash for accrued restructuring costs of million  deferred revenue of million  accrued liabilities of million  accounts receivable of million and accounts payable of million 
these uses of cash were offset by a million decrease in prepaid expense and other assets 
the increase in receivables was related to higher overall revenue offset by a seven day improvement in day s sales outstanding compared to the prior year 
the decrease in payables is primarily related to a lower overall level of operating expense in compared to net cash from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million and primarily consisted of capital expenditures of million and total investments in marketable securities of million  partially offset by proceeds from disposal of property and equipment and a reduction in restricted cash of million 
our capital expenditures were principally comprised of the buy out of capital leases from our primary supplier of network equipment during the third quarter and build outs of data center and office space in the latter half of the year 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million and primarily consisted of net cash received from acquired businesses of million and a reduction in restricted cash of million  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of million 
the purchase of property and equipment related to the purchase of assets for our network infrastructure and the cost related to the relocation of nine network access points 
we expect the purchase of property and equipment will increase during as we continued to enhance and expand our service offerings 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  and was primarily from proceeds of million received on the redemption and maturity of investments  along with proceeds of million in purchases of property  plant  and equipment  and a reduction in restricted cash of million 
cash received was partially offset by million used for purchases of property and equipment and million contributed to our joint venture investment  internap japan 
of the million used for purchases of property and equipment  million related to the purchase of assets from our primary provider of leased networking equipment as part of terms of an amendment to our master lease arrangement with the lessor 
net cash from financing activities 
since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of our equity securities  capital leases and bank loans 
see liquidity below 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
in september  we negotiated the buy out of all remaining lease schedules under a master lease agreement with our primary supplier of network equipment 
under the terms of the buy out agreement  the company paid the supplier million  representing remaining capital lease payment obligations  end of lease asset values and sales tax 
the million buy out was paid with million in cash on hand and the proceeds from the new million term loan from silicon valley bank 
on march   we sold million shares of our common stock in a public offering at a purchase price of per share which resulted in net proceeds to us of million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expense 
in addition  we received million from the exercise of stock options and warrants during the year ended december  cash used in financing activities included million toward reducing our notes payable and aforementioned capital lease obligations and million to repay the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility 
as a result of these activities  we held million in notes payable and million in capital lease obligations as of december   with million in notes and capital leases scheduled as due within the next months 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
cash provided included net proceeds from issuance of common stock of million and proceeds from exercise of stock options and warrants of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was reduced by principal payments on notes payable of million  payments on capital lease obligations of million and a million net reduction in our revolving credit facility 
the net proceeds of million from issuance of common stock was received in august when we completed the sale  pursuant to a private placement  of million shares of our common stock  par value per share  at a price of per share 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
cash used included million related to payments on capital lease obligations and million for payments of notes payable 
these uses were offset by proceeds of million related to exercises of stock options and warrants and million related to the sale of common stock  including stock issued to employees pursuant to the amended and restated employee stock purchase plan 
during we amended the terms of our master lease agreement with our primary supplier of networking equipment 
the amended terms of the master lease included a retroactive effective date to march   and extended the payment terms and provided for a deferral of lease payments of the underlying lease schedules for a period of months in exchange for a buy out payment of million in satisfaction of the outstanding lease obligation on schedules totaling million and for the purchase of the equipment leased under the same schedules totaling million 
capital equipment leases have been used since inception to finance the majority of our networking equipment located in our network access points other than leasehold improvements related to our colocation facilities 
payments under capital lease agreements totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and respectively 
liquidity we have incurred net losses in each quarterly and annual period since we began operations in may we incurred net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we expect to incur additional operating losses in the future  and we cannot guarantee that we will become profitable 
even if we achieve profitability  given the competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we operate  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis  and our failure to do so would adversely affect our business  including our ability to raise additional funds 
we have experienced negative operating cash flow and have depended upon equity and debt financings  as well as borrowings under our credit facilities  to meet our cash requirements in each quarterly and annual period since we began our operations in may we expect to meet our cash requirements in through a combination of existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in marketable securities  borrowings under our credit facilities and proceeds from our recently completed public offering in march of our capital requirements depend on several factors  including the rate of market acceptance of our services  the ability to expand and retain our customer base  and other factors 
if our cash requirements vary materially from those currently planned  if our cost reduction initiatives have unanticipated adverse effects on our business  or if we fail to generate sufficient cash flow from the sales of our services  we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional financing on commercially favorable terms  or at all 
provisions in our existing credit facility limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
at december   we had a million revolving credit facility  a million term loan which reduces availability under the revolving credit facility and a new million term loan under a loan and security agreement with a bank 
the agreement was amended as of september   to add the million term loan  to extend the expiration date of the revolving credit facility from october  to september  and update loan covenants 
the new term loan has a fixed interest rate of and is due in equal monthly installments of principal plus interest through september  the balance outstanding at december  was million 
the loan was used to purchase assets recorded as capital leases under a master agreement with our primary supplier of networking equipment 
availability under the revolving credit facility is based on of eligible accounts receivable plus of unrestricted cash and marketable investments 
as of december   the balance outstanding under the million term loan was million along with million of letters of credit issued  and we had available million in borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility 
as of december   the company was in violation of a loan covenant in its credit facility requiring minimum cash ebitda  as defined  and subsequently received a formal waiver from the bank 
the violation was primarily the result of higher than anticipated capital expenditures in the quarter ended december  relating to facility and data center expansion and to a lesser extent  the subsequent impact of the restatement on the minimum cash ebitda calculation 
even if a waiver was not received  we believe that we have sufficient cash and other resources to operate our business plan for the foreseeable future 
the company was also in violation of a loan covenant requiring minimum cash ebitda  as defined  for the quarter ended september   and subsequently received a formal waiver from the bank 
the violation resulted from the restructuring charge that caused the minimum cash ebitda for that period to be less than the level required under the credit facility 
in addition  subsequent to filing the quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended june   management became aware of information that the company was not in compliance with certain non financial reporting covenants for the may  and june  reporting periods 
management promptly responded and corrected the violation within the specified cure period and received a formal waiver in conjunction with the september  amended credit facility with silicon valley bank 
public offering 
on march   we sold million shares of our common stock in a public offering at a purchase price of per share which resulted in net proceeds to us of million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expense 
we intend to continue to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes 
general corporate purposes may include capital investments in our network access point infrastructure and systems  repayment of debt and capital lease obligations and potential acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies 
commitments and other obligations 
we have commitments and other obligations that are contractual in nature and will represent a use of cash in the future unless there are modifications to the terms of those agreements 
network commitments primarily represent purchase commitments made to our largest bandwidth vendors and  to a lesser extent  contractual payments to license colocation space used for resale to customers 
our ability to improve cash used in operations in the future would be negatively impacted if we do not grow our business at a rate that would allow us to offset the service commitments with corresponding revenue growth 
the following table summarizes our credit obligations and future contractual commitments in thousands  as of december  payments due by period total less than year years to years to after years notes payable capital lease obligations operating lease commitments service commitments total credit facility 
as noted above  the company has a million revolving credit facility  a million term loan which reduces availability under the revolving credit facility and a new million term loan under a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank 
the agreement was amended as of september   to add the million term loan and to extend the expiration date of the revolving credit facility from october  to september  the new term loan is payable in equal monthly installments of principal through september  availability under the revolving credit facility and term loan is based on of eligible accounts receivable plus of unrestricted cash and marketable investments 
in addition  the loan and security agreement will make available to us an additional million under a term loan if we meet certain debt coverage ratios 
at december   the balance outstanding under the million and million term loans were million and million  respectively  along with million of letters of credit issued  and we had available million in borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility 
as of december   the interest rate under the million and term loans are fixed at and  respectively 
this credit facility expires on september  there can be no assurance that the credit facility will be renewed upon expiration or that we will be able to obtain credit facilities on commercially favorable terms 
the credit facility contains certain covenants  including covenants that require us to achieve target minimum cash ebitda  as defined in the agreement  maintain a minimum tangible net worth and that restrict our ability to incur further indebtedness 
as discussed above  the company was in violation of the minimum cash ebitda covenant for the quarter ended december   and subsequently received a formal waiver from the bank 
the violation was primarily the result of higher than anticipated capital expenditures in the quarter ended december  relating to facility and data center expansion and to a lesser extent  the subsequent impact of the restatement on the minimum cash ebitda calculation 
common and preferred stock 
on march   we sold million shares of our common stock in a public offering at a purchase price of per share which resulted in net proceeds to us of million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expense 
effective september   all shares of our outstanding series a convertible preferred stock were mandatorily converted into common stock in accordance with the terms of the company s certificate of incorporation 
an aggregate of million shares of convertible preferred stock with a recorded value of million was converted into million shares of common stock during the quarter ended september  accordingly  the company had no shares of series a convertible preferred stock outstanding subsequent to the mandatory conversion 
the mandatory conversion had no effect on the outstanding warrants to purchase common stock that were issued in conjunction with the series a preferred stock 
on august   we completed a private placement of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
we received million  net of issuance costs 
because we issued shares of our common stock in the private placement at a price below the conversion price of the series a preferred stock at that time  the number of shares of common stock into which the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock were convertible increased by million shares 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we recorded a deemed dividend of million  which was attributable to the additional incremental number of shares the series a preferred stock convertible into common stock 
lease facilities 
since our inception  we have financed the purchase of substantial network routing equipment using capital leases with our primary supplier 
as discussed above  we negotiated the buy out of all remaining lease schedules under a master lease agreement with our primary supplier in september our future minimum lease payments on remaining capital lease obligations at december  totaled million  with million representing the present value of minimum lease payments 
the negotiated buy out of all remaining lease schedules under a master lease agreement with our primary supplier of network equipment included a cash payment of million  comprising remaining capital lease obligations as of september   along with end of lease asset values and sales tax  resulting in a million increase to fixed assets 
the million buy out was funded through million in cash on hand and the proceeds from the aforementioned million term loan from silicon valley bank 
as of december   the company s other remaining capital leases have expiration dates through february restructuring and impairment costs restructuring charge 
with the continuing overcapacity created in the internet connectivity market and internet protocol services market  during  we implemented additional restructuring actions to align our business with market opportunities 
as a result  we recorded a business restructuring charge and asset impairments of million in the three months ended september  the charges were primarily comprised of real estate obligations related to a decision to relocate the corporate office from seattle  washington to an existing leased facility in atlanta  georgia  net asset write downs related to the departure from the seattle office and costs associated with further personnel reductions 
the restructuring and asset impairment charge of million during was offset by a million adjustment  described above  resulting from the decision to utilize the atlanta facility as our corporate office 
the previously unused space in the atlanta location had been accrued as part of the restructuring liability established during fiscal year included in the million restructuring charge are million of personnel costs related to a reduction in force of approximately employees 
this represents employee severance payments made during restructuring costs 
for the year ended december   we incurred million in restructuring costs which primarily represented retention bonuses and moving expense related to the relocation of our corporate office to atlanta  georgia 
we continue to evaluate our restructuring reserve as plans are being executed  which could result in additional charges in future periods 
restructuring costs 
we incurred net additional restructuring costs of million during as a result of a comprehensive analysis of the remaining accrued restructuring liability 
during the quarter ended september   a new sublease was negotiated on one abandoned property and new terms involving a reconfiguration of usable and abandoned space were negotiated with the lessor on another abandoned property  both of which were included in the original restructuring 
the last of our restructured network infrastructure obligations was also terminated during the quarter ended september  the net charge to restructuring resulted from an increase of million relating to real estate obligations offset by a reduction of million pertaining to network infrastructure and other obligations 
after reviewing the current analysis  management concluded that the facilities remaining in the restructuring accrual were taking longer than expected to sublease and those that were subleased resulted in lower than expected sublease rates 
consequently  the currently projected obligations exceeded the unadjusted liability by million over the remaining lease terms  with the last commitment expiring in july during the quarter ended september   all other remaining contractual obligations for network infrastructure and other costs included in the restructuring were satisfied and we reduced the remaining recorded liability for the obligations from million to zero 
we previously reported net restructuring charges of million in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  as part of our analyses in connection with the restatement  we determined that too much of the monthly rent payments were applied towards accrued restructuring  thus understating previously recorded rent expense and the remaining restructuring liability by million 
we also obtained additional information regarding the square footage of one property that resulted in a restatement of amounts previously reported to reduce real estate obligations  the total restructuring accrual and expense as of september  by million 
real estate obligations 
both the and restructuring plans required us to abandon certain leased properties not currently in use or that would not be utilized by us in the future 
also included in real estate obligations was the abandonment of certain colocation license obligations 
accordingly  we recorded real estate related restructuring costs of million  net of non cash plan adjustments  which were estimates of losses in excess of estimated sublease revenue or termination fees to be incurred on these real estate obligations over the remaining lease terms expiring through these costs were determined based upon our estimate of anticipated sublease rates and time to sublease the facilities 
if rental rates decrease in these markets or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these properties  the actual loss could further exceed the original estimates or revisions in september network infrastructure obligations 
the changes to our network infrastructure require that we decommission certain network ports we do not currently use and will not use in the future pursuant to the restructuring plan 
these costs have been accrued as components of the restructuring charge because they represent amounts to be incurred under contractual obligations in existence at the time the restructuring plan was initiated 
these contractual obligations will continue in the future with no economic benefit  or they contain penalties that will be incurred if the obligations are cancelled 
cash reductions in the following tables have been restated to correct for amounts incorrectly recorded against the restructuring liability as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
non cash plan adjustments have been restated to correct for the effect of recording the deferred rent liability related to the atlanta location coming out of restructuring as also discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements

off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any arrangements that would qualify as an off balance sheet arrangement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash and cash equivalents 
we maintain cash and short term deposits at our financial institutions 
due to the short term nature of our deposits  they are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
as of december   all of our cash equivalents mature within three months 
other investments 
we have a million equity investment in aventail  an early stage  privately held company  after having reduced the balance for an impairment loss of million in this strategic investment is inherently risky  in part because the market for the products or services being offered or developed by aventail has not been proven 
because of risk associated with this investment  we could lose our entire initial investment in aventail 
furthermore we have invested million in internap japan  our joint venture with ntt me corporation 
this investment is accounted for using the equity method and to date we have recognized million in equity method losses  representing our proportionate share of the aggregate joint venture losses 
furthermore  the joint venture investment is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in addition  the market for services being offered by internap japan has not been proven and may never materialize 
notes payable 
as of december  we had notes payable recorded at their present value of million bearing a rate of interest which we believe is commensurate with their associated market risk 
capital leases 
as of december  we had capital leases recorded at million reflecting the present value of future lease payments 
we believe the interest rates used in calculating the present values of these lease payments are a reasonable approximation of fair value and their associated market risk is minimal 
credit facility 
as of december  we had million available under our revolving credit facility with silicon valley bank  and the balance outstanding under the million and million term loans were million and million  respectively 
the interest for the million and million term loans were fixed at and  respectively 
the interest rate under the revolving credit facility is variable and was at december  we believe these interest rates are reasonable approximations of fair value and the market risk in minimal 
interest rate risk 
our objective in managing interest rate risk is to maintain favorable long term fixed rate or a balance of fixed and variable rate debt that will lower our overall borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters 
currently  our strategy for managing interest rate risk does not include the use of derivative securities 
the table below presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates for the company s debt obligations that extend beyond one year and are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  dollars in thousands december  fair value long term debt term loan interest rate foreign currency risk 
substantially all of our revenue is currently in united states dollars and from customers primarily in the united states 
therefore  we do not believe we currently have any significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk
