item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the discussion and analysis presented below refers to and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
our results may be impacted by variability due to changes in modality mix and the volume of procedures performed  physician referral and vacation patterns  the impact of hospital and physician affiliated imaging centers that compete in our primary and questar operations  the timing and negotiation of managed care and service contracts  the availability of technologists and other personnel resources  and trends in receivable collectibility 
we are impacted by seasonality in that referring physicians and technologists often schedule vacations in the summer months which typically results in a decline in our volumes and service fee revenue while increasing cost of services as we contract for the services of temporary technologists at higher rates 
we are a leading national provider of diagnostic imaging services through our ownership and operation of free standing  outpatient diagnostic imaging centers 
we utilize sophisticated technology and technical expertise to perform a broad range of imaging procedures  such as magnetic resonance imaging mri  computed tomography ct  positron emission tomography pet  pet ct  nuclear medicine  ultrasound  mammography  bone densitometry dexa  general radiography x ray and fluoroscopy 
for the year ended december   we derived of our service fee revenue from the ownership  management and operation of our imaging center network and of our service fee revenue from administrative  management and information services provided to contracted radiology practices 
as of december   we owned  operated or maintained  through our two operating segments  an ownership interest in imaging equipment at locations  with imaging centers located in states  including primary operations in the mid atlantic  the bay area  california  treasure coast  florida  northeast  kansas  and the finger lakes rochester and hudson valley markets in new york state  and questar operations with imaging centers located in arizona  california  colorado and minnesota 
as disclosed in our form q for the nine months ended september   we expected to finalize a retrospective collection analysis of our accounts receivable in the fourth quarter of accordingly  in connection with our december year end closing process  we did finalize this retrospective collection analysis 
this retrospective process represents an enhancement to our methodology for estimating the amount of contractual adjustments and provision for doubtful accounts necessary to reduce gross revenue billed charges and gross receivables to net amounts realizable from managed care  medicare  medicaid  private and other payors 
this enhanced methodology is based on the matching of cash collections to billed charges by month of service 
in connection with our provision for doubtful accounts  we continue to record this expense based on historical write offs which has not significantly changed 
as a result of the above process  we increased contractual adjustments by million resulting in a corresponding decrease in service fee revenue and accounts receivable in the fourth quarter of to reflect the change in estimate of net realizable value 

table of contents service fee revenue from our primary operations is comprised primarily of billed charges for both the technical and professional components for services performed  reduced by estimated contractual adjustments and by amounts retained by contracted radiology practice groups for their professional services  pursuant to our medical services agreements 
under these medical services agreements  the company provides contracted radiology practices with the facilities and equipment used in its medical practice  assumes responsibility for the management of the operations  and employs substantially all of the non physician personnel utilized by the contracted radiology practices 
in connection with operations related to our questar subsidiary  service fee revenue is comprised primarily of billed charges for technical services performed at our questar imaging centers reduced by estimated contractual adjustments 
revenue is recognized once services are performed by contracted radiology practices  the imaging centers  or both 
the provision for doubtful accounts related to established charges is reflected as an operating expense rather than a reduction of revenue 
our patient accounting system currently does not record contractual adjustments at the time of billing 
instead  adjustments for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts are estimated based on historical collection experience using a retrospective collection analysis  payment versus charge schedules and accounts receivable aging models 
as these factors change  changes in estimates are made in the appropriate period 
we expect to implement a system in fiscal that will allow us to estimate and record contractual adjustments at the time of billing at our primary operations 
the company s service fee revenue is dependent upon the operating results of the contracted radiology practice groups and diagnostic imaging centers 
where state law allows  service fees due under the medical services agreements for the contracted radiology practice groups are derived from two distinct revenue streams a negotiated percentage of the professional revenues  reduced by certain expenses non physician salaries and benefits  rent  depreciation  insurance  interest and other physician costs  as defined in the medical services agreements  and of the adjusted technical revenues as defined in the medical service agreements up to a designated ceiling at which point certain of the medical services agreements provide for a technical bonus to the contracted radiology practice groups for a percentage amount in excess of this ceiling 
in states where the law requires a flat fee structure  the company has negotiated a base service fee  which approximates the estimated fair market value of the services provided under the medical services agreements and which is renegotiated each year to equal the fair market value of the services provided under the medical services agreements 
our diagnostic imaging centers are also principally dependent on our ability to attract referrals from primary care physicians  specialists and other healthcare providers 
the referral often depends on the existence of a contractual arrangement with the referred patient s health benefit plan 
the company has contracts with health benefit plans representing many of the patients in the markets we serve 
a summary of our volumes and service fee revenue follows in thousands for the year ended december  high end volumes other volumes professional component technical component service fee revenue defined as mri  pet and ct procedures 
capitation revenue of million  million and million in  and  respectively  is included in service fee revenue above 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our diagnostic imaging center service fee revenue was generated from capitated arrangements 
of this  two thirds relates to contracts with two physician groups and the remainder relates to two contracts with one managed care payor 
our charge masters at individual subsidiaries are generally set at approximately two times the current medicare fee schedule because we are generally paid the lower of billed charges  a negotiated flat rate or a multiple of the current medicare fee schedule 
additionally  because the majority of our managed care payor contracts have fixed rates  we generally do not raise charge master pricing gross charges 
it is our policy that proposed price gross charge increases to any subsidiary charge master must be approved in writing by the vice president of our patient services group 
for fiscal  we estimate that we may receive from  to  in additional service fee revenue due to changes to the medicare fee schedules that were effective with the november  federal register 
contracted rates that we received under managed care contracts excluding capitation arrangements and blue cross blue shield contracts in fiscal were up approximately in in fiscal  we expect our managed care contract rates including those rates for blue cross and blue shield payors  which are major payors for us in several markets to remain relatively constant compared to rates received in fiscal 
table of contents results of operations our primary operations consist of owning and operating diagnostic imaging centers and providing administrative  management  information  and other services to certain contracted radiology practice groups 
these contracted radiology practice groups provide professional interpretation and supervision services to our diagnostic imaging centers and to hospitals and joint ventures in which we participate 
our services are designed to leverage our existing infrastructure and improve radiology practice groups or joint venture profitability  efficiency and effectiveness 
we also operate primarily single modality imaging centers through our subsidiary  questar 
because of different characteristics from our primary operations  including location  market concentration  contracting leverage  and capital requirements  the single modality nature of most of the centers and the structure of the management service agreements with physicians related to the company s questar operations  senior management makes resource allocation decisions separately for questar and our primary operations 
effective october   we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase  for million in cash  diagnostic imaging equipment and an equipment financing right that was granted prior to the formation of radiologix and to assume certain equipment leases 
as a result of this acquisition  we recorded a million intangible asset for this equipment financing right  which we are amortizing over years  the remaining accounting life of the underlying medical services agreement initially years 
under this financing right  the seller had a perpetual right to finance certain types of equipment on behalf of radiologix and to charge the company usage based rent on these pieces of equipment 
service fee revenue is not affected as a result of this purchase 
instead  this acquisition eliminates expenses that previously varied based on volume resulting in incremental reductions in equipment lease expense as volume increases 
if this transaction had been effective on january  instead of october   we estimate that cost of services would have increased by  equipment lease expense would have decreased by million  depreciation and amortization would have increased by million and pre tax loss would have decreased by million for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   our operations reflected volume increases of over technical service volumes for the year ended december  and ongoing improvements in our service mix to high end procedures 
in the fourth quarter of  we received additional service fee revenue of approximately  as a result of renegotiating a capitated contract in our bay area market and approximately  from a new management contract in our mid atlantic market 
these amounts were offset by a  decrease in service fee revenue due to the renegotiation of a management services agreement  which resulted in a decrease in our management fee percentage and an increase in the technical bonus component to the contracted radiology group 
overall  the above activities resulted in an increase in service fee revenue of over the year ended december  and reflect the impact of our improved organic growth including the addition of new imaging centers and imaging equipment placed into operations since december  the impact of hurricanes on our southeastern operations resulted in an estimated  loss of revenue in september compared to an estimated  loss of revenue due to the impact of hurricane isabel on our mid atlantic operations in september imaging centers questar a summary of our questar operations is as follows in thousands for the year ended december  centers in continuing operations at year end centers in discontinued operations at year end service fee revenues continuing operations service fee revenues discontinued operations impairment of goodwill continuing operations impairment of goodwill discontinued operations impairment of long lived assets discontinued operations gain loss on dispositions of centers  net pre tax income loss continuing pre tax loss discontinued 
table of contents in november  we sold our joint venture interest in our questar tampa operations  including accounts receivable  to our venture partner for  in cash  resulting in a loss of  including the write off of goodwill for  in june we sold a questar center for million in cash  resulting in a gain of  net of a write off of goodwill for  in fiscal  the company recorded an million pre tax charge to discontinued operations related to the impairment of goodwill of questar 
in the first quarter of the company recorded a million charge related to questar in connection with our annual assessment of goodwill based on our internal analysis  which included a valuation performed by an independent valuation firm 
in june  after performing an extensive reassessment of our questar imaging center portfolio  management concluded that certain centers were not strategic to our future plans and would be unable to meet and sustain our profitability requirements going forward 
that reassessment considered location  contracting leverage  expected capital requirements  the single modality nature of most of these sites  current operating trends  and the sale of our most profitable questar center on june  the company s decision to dispose of this group of imaging centers created an event that required us to reassess the carrying value of the assets related to these centers  including goodwill at our questar segment 
this reassessment considered the impact on the value of the ongoing  deteriorating operating trends in these centers  as well as the implications of disposing of individual centers versus operating those centers as part of an ongoing operating enterprise 
to assist us in that reassessment  we engaged an independent valuation firm to estimate the fair value of our combined questar sites 
as a result of our reassessment and the independent valuation  the company recorded an million pre tax charge to continuing operations related to the impairment of questar goodwill in june we also recorded a  pre tax charge to impair long lived assets of certain questar centers in june in december  the company recorded a million pre tax charge to continuing operations related to the impairment of goodwill at our questar center in arizona 
this center is one of six questar sites that we chose to keep in continuing operations at december  we did not anticipate this impairment previously as the center is in a strategic new location and was projected to improve in volumes  profitability and net cash flows in the fourth quarter of and throughout however  it appears that because of disruption caused by the move to this new location  confusion in the community due to a change in the center s name  and increased local competition  we have had difficulty in achieving the volumes  profitability and net cash flow levels that we expected in the fourth quarter of and budgeted for in accordingly  although we intend to keep this center open in an attempt to engineer a turnaround in its operations  our revised volume  profitability and cash flow estimates did not support the recoverability of this center s goodwill at december  we assess the viability of our imaging centers throughout the year 
in the event we decide to dispose of one or more imaging centers  additional charges may result depending on cash flow and market conditions at the time of our assessment 
medical services agreements in addition to continually assessing the financial viability of our imaging centers  management also evaluates the businesses surrounding our relationships with radiologists and radiology practice groups that have reading privileges at our facilities 
these businesses may include radiologix imaging centers and or professional reading agreements involving another entity s inpatient or outpatient imaging centers 
in most cases  individual radiologists and radiology practice groups serve in our facilities pursuant to medical services agreements entered into when radiologix acquired the practice group s assets 
the value of these arrangements is recorded as intangible assets when acquired 
although the agreements may extend for longer periods  the value of the intangible assets is amortized over years based on sec guidance 
mid atlantic medical services agreement during the third quarter of  management determined that the ability of one of the radiology groups to perform in accordance with a medical services agreement administered by one of our mid atlantic subsidiaries had diminished significantly 
with several owned imaging centers covered by the medical services agreement operating at financial losses  deteriorating financial conditions at hospitals involving professional reading arrangements  and the resignation from the practice of two physician leaders  management concluded that the value of our intangible asset had become significantly impaired 
as a result  radiologix and the radiology group agreed to terminate the medical services agreement 
the company has decided to dispose of three unprofitable imaging centers and to transfer the professional reading responsibility for certain other centers to another radiology group that operates under a medical services agreement with us in the mid atlantic market 
as of december   the company will no longer be a party to most of the professional reading arrangements at certain hospitals and accordingly  we will receive minimal service fee revenue from these arrangements in we received million in service fee revenue from these professional reading arrangements in based on our assessment and the actions that we have undertaken  the company recorded third quarter impairment charges of million to write off the unamortized portion of intangible assets related to this group s medical services agreement  and  to write off long lived assets related to the centers planned for disposition  one of which was disposed of in december 
table of contents service fee revenue and pre tax income loss for the remaining two centers planned for disposition in july and november  respectively  and the professional reading arrangements that we will no longer be a party to  as reflected in continuing operations including impairment charges  are as follows in thousands for the year ended december  service fee revenue pre tax income loss san antonio  texas medical services agreement we completed the sale of our operations in san antonio  texas in the second quarter of the purchase price was million  resulting in a gain on sale of approximately million  or million net of taxes per dilutive share 
net cash received was million after purchase price adjustments 
the sale included assets we owned and leased in our operation of m s imaging partners  inc  a diagnostic imaging center  and certain partnership interests  but did not include accounts receivable aggregating approximately million  which we retained 
other medical services agreements in addition to the medical services agreement we terminated effective january  see note  we amended a medical services agreement which resulted in a reduction in our management fee effective january  and a separate medical services agreement which resulted in the establishment of a technical bonus to the contracted radiology group and a reduction in our management fee effective october  our management fees for certain other medical services agreements declined by in and will decline by an additional in the estimated annual impact to our service fee revenue for these decreases is approximately  in connection with the amendment of a medical services agreement with a contracted radiology group in july  the company recorded deferred revenue of million in consideration for the amended agreement  which amount is amortized over years 
in december  the company amended the medical services agreement of another contracted radiology practice and recorded deferred revenue of million in consideration for the amended agreement  which is amortized over years 
other charges a summary of other charges in continuing operations in addition to the impairment amounts discussed above is as follows in thousands for the year ended december  other impairment contract termination costs severance and related costs litigation and regulatory matters amendment of credit facility we incurred impairment charges and other costs aggregating  in the third quarter of associated with damages from hurricanes impacting our southeastern operations 
we are currently working with our insurance broker to determine what  if any  insurance recoveries we may receive for property damage and may record insurance recoveries  if any  in fiscal in the fourth quarter of  we recorded additional impairment charges of  for software related to our ris system in our northeast operations where software has been replaced in connection with the implementation of our reward program 
in fiscal  we incurred impairment charges of  to write off a patient scheduling software system that we replaced 
in the third quarter of  we recorded  for lease termination costs related to diagnostic equipment no longer in use  and  to write off software costs associated with canceling a software contract 
during the years ended december    and  we recognized  million and  in charges  respectively  in connection with severance and other related costs for changes in the company s senior management team 

table of contents in the third quarter of  we recorded  for a litigation settlement 
for the year ended december   we recorded a  charge for regulatory matters and related legal and consulting costs in connection with self reporting a matter to the us department of health and human services office of the inspector general oig   in costs to meet hipaa compliance requirements  and a  litigation settlement related to our mid atlantic operations 
in we incurred costs of  in connection with amending a credit facility

field salaries and benefits as a percentage of service fee revenue from continuing operations for the year ended december  were compared to for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from higher cost of temporary labor required to fill vacant positions  especially radiology technologists salary market adjustments effective in july for certain employees at one of our subsidiaries  and bonuses paid to field personnel 
field salaries and benefits costs were also impacted by new imaging centers placed into operations since december   internal recruiting costs to fill open positions and internal marketing costs related to new sales program initiatives 
field salaries and benefits as a percentage of service fee revenue from continuing operations for the year ended december  and  excluding the san antonio and the terminated mid atlantic operations  were and  respectively 
management continues to evaluate our service offerings  patient flows and technology offerings to identify more efficient and less costly methods of providing high quality patient care and continues to evaluate its back office and support operations for new opportunities to gain economies of scale 
we believe our reward program  once fully implemented  will help us achieve greater efficiencies and lower our operating costs 
in connection with field salaries and benefits  market studies performed in our primary operating locations indicate that certain employee positions could be above or below market salary rates 
we address performance and merit increases on an annual basis in march through our focal point review process 
field supplies as a percentage of service fee revenue from continuing operations for the year ended december  were compared to for the year ended december  this percentage decline was primarily due to reduced film costs at one subsidiary that implemented a pacs system in  improved control over supply costs and a decrease in nuclear medical volume  which reduces our radiopharmaceutical costs 

table of contents field rent increased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the impact of imaging centers placed in operation since december  equipment lease expenses increased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the impact of imaging center sites placed into operation since december  and decisions we made to lease rather than buy certain imaging equipment offset by the impact of lease buyouts and the acquisition of an equipment financing right effective october  which  as discussed above  eliminates equipment lease expense that was previously recorded based on volume 
other field expenses increased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due primarily to system conversion  upgrade and outsourcing costs for our patient accounting systems  physician purchased service costs  higher marketing costs in our primary operations  higher workers compensation costs and higher off site storage costs offset by decreases in repairs  maintenance and service contract costs on diagnostic equipment  lower legal and consulting purchased service costs related to the oig matter  lower malpractice insurance costs and lower external recruiting costs 
provision for doubtful accounts increased by million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due primarily to weaker than expected collection performance on receivables owed us for professional services we performed at two mid atlantic hospitals as well as receivables we retained from the sale of our san antonio operations 
depreciation and amortization decreased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the effect of asset impairments and the impact of assets that became fully depreciated during fiscal  offset by the impact of new imaging centers and new equipment placed in service since december   lease buyouts in  and the acquisition of an equipment financing right and related diagnostic equipment effective october  corporate  general and administrative expenses increased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due primarily to costs associated with filling vacant executive positions  relocation costs for our former chief executive officer  approximately million in costs relating to our sarbanes oxley section compliance efforts  increased costs related to our sales  marketing  information technology and development departments and approximately  in management bonus costs accrued in the fourth quarter  offset by reduced legal costs as a result of establishing an in house legal department which resulted in reducing our contracted legal costs 
interest expense net of interest income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is lower due primarily to our million retirement of debt in the second quarter of equity in earnings decreased in compared to primarily due to the sale of certain joint ventures in connection with our san antonio operations  a  charge to increase contractual adjustments in the fourth quarter of  increases in contractual adjustments and provision for doubtful accounts during and increased tube replacement costs 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   our operations declined in spite of volume increases of compared to volumes for the year ended december   due to increased competition  the slow down of the economy  increased payor pre authorization activity and a shortage of technologists 
this resulted in a decrease in service fee revenue of over the year ended december  the following table outlines our operating expenses  excluding million and  of severance and other related costs in and respectively  million for litigation settlement and regulatory matters in   of costs related to an amendment of the credit facility in  and  to meet hipaa compliance requirements in  for the years ended december  and below percent increase decrease percent of service fee revenue basis point change service fee revenue cost of services equipment lease provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization corporate  general and administrative interest expense  net total operating expense  excluding gain and charges

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity for the year ended december   was derived from cash and cash equivalents and net cash generated by operating activities  as well as million in cash proceeds from the sales of our san antonio  texas operations and certain of our questar centers 
as of december   we had current assets of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million  and current liabilities of million  including current maturities of long term debt and capital lease obligations of  for the year ended december   we generated million in net operating cash flow  invested million and used cash of million in financing activities 
net cash from operating activities for the year ended december  of million decreased from million for the same period in our days sales outstanding on accounts receivable decreased from days at december  to days at december  and to days at december  we calculate days sales outstanding by dividing accounts receivable  net of allowances  by the three month average revenue per day 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
purchases of property and equipment during the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively  including million to buyout operating leases in in the fourth quarter of  we acquired an equipment financing right and diagnostic equipment for million in cash 
in  we received million in consideration for the sale of certain operations and imaging centers 
also during  we transferred million to restricted cash in accordance with our master lease agreement with ge healthcare financial services ge as discussed below 
we expect to spend approximately million in fiscal on equipment lease buyouts 
net cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
at december   we had outstanding senior note borrowings of million and a million convertible subordinated junior note 
at december   amounts considered outstanding under the revolving credit facility totaled million related to two letters of credit in connection with our high retention workers compensation program with million available for borrowings 
borrowings under this line are limited to of eligible accounts receivable  as defined under the credit facility 
borrowings are secured by substantially all of our assets and a pledge of the capital stock of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
at december   we had not met certain incurrence tests under our debt agreements 
as a result  we are limited to borrowing an additional million until such time as we meet these tests 
on july   we amended our master lease with ge under an amended and restated master lease agreement 
through this arrangement  ge has agreed to fund up to million of equipment leases through december   and requires that at least two thirds of the outstanding balance represent ge healthcare equipment 
in connection with the master lease agreement  the company is required to provide additional cash collateral in a restricted account equal to of the aggregate amounts outstanding under the master lease agreement 
the accompanying december  balance sheet includes million of restricted cash under this provision 
ge provided us with a written waiver stating that ge agreed to waive compliance with the financial leverage ratio for the year ending december  and to modify this calculation for to exclude the million adjustment that was recorded to reduce service fee revenue and accounts receivable in the fourth quarter of at december  applicable amounts outstanding under the master lease agreement totaled million  commitments for leases signed but not placed in service under the master lease agreement were million  and million remained available for future leases 
in fiscal  we plan to spend approximately million for capital expenditures in connection with our reward program  million for expansion of centers including de novo projects and commit million for major diagnostic equipment leases over the respective lease terms 
we operate in a capital intensive  high fixed cost industry that requires significant amounts of capital to fund operations  particularly the initial start up and development cost of new diagnostic imaging centers and the acquisition of additional centers and new diagnostic imaging equipment 
we currently believe that our cash balances  the expected cash flow from operations  and our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and our master lease line will be sufficient to fund our working capital  acquisitions and capital expenditure requirements for the next eighteen months 
our long term liquidity needs will consist of working capital and capital expenditure requirements  the funding of future acquisitions and repayment of debt 
we intend to fund these long term liquidity needs from cash generated from operations  available borrowings under our revolving credit facility  our master lease line of credit  and future debt and equity financings 
however  our ability to generate cash is subject to our performance  general economic conditions  industry trends and other factors 
many of these factors are beyond our control and cannot be anticipated at this time 
to the extent we are unable to generate sufficient cash from our operations  or if funds are not available under our revolving credit facility or our master lease line  we may be unable to meet our capital expenditure and debt service requirements 
furthermore  we may not be able to raise any necessary additional funds through bank financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities on terms acceptable to us  if at all 

table of contents as of december   long term debt  including capital lease obligations and non cancelable operating leases are as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates 
our critical accounting policies are described below to provide a better understanding of how we develop our judgments about future events and related estimations and how they can impact our financial statements 
a critical accounting policy is one that requires our most difficult  subjective or complex estimates and assessments and is fundamental to our results of operations 
we identified our most critical accounting policies to be revenue recognition and estimation of allowances for contractuals and doubtful accounts  evaluation of intangible assets  including goodwill  and long lived assets for impairment  and estimation of a valuation allowance in accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets 
revenue recognition  contractual allowances and allowances for doubtful accounts as disclosed in our form q for the nine months ended september   we expected to finalize a retrospective collection analysis of our accounts receivable in the fourth quarter of accordingly  in connection with our december year end closing process  we did finalize this retrospective collection analysis 
this retrospective process represents an enhancement to our methodology for estimating the amount of contractual adjustments and provision for doubtful accounts necessary to reduce gross revenue billed charges and gross receivables to net amounts realizable from managed care  medicare  medicaid  private and other payors 
this enhanced methodology is based on the matching of cash collections to billed charges by month of service 
in connection with our provision for doubtful accounts  we continue to record this expense based on historical write offs which experience has not significantly changed 
as a result of the above process  we increased contractual adjustments by million resulting in a corresponding decrease in service fee revenue and accounts receivable in the fourth quarter of to reflect the change in estimate of net realizable value 
service fee revenue from the contracted radiology practice groups professional revenue component and diagnostic imaging centers technical revenue component is recorded when services are rendered by the contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers based on established gross charges billed and reduced by estimated contractual adjustments and amounts retained by the contracted radiology practice groups under the terms of medical services agreements 
our patient accounting system currently does not record contractual adjustments at the time of billing 
instead  contractual adjustments and the provision for doubtful accounts are estimated based on historical collection experience using a retrospective collection analysis  which we began using in december  payment versus charge schedules and aging models 
should circumstances change shift in payor mix  decline in economic conditions or deterioration in aging of patient receivables  our estimates of the net realizable value of patient receivables could be reduced by a material amount 
we plan to implement a system in fiscal that will allow us to record contractual adjustments at the time of billing 
we have estimated that a change in our collection percentage of could result in a change in service fee revenue of million per year 
our accounts receivable write off process is primarily system driven whereby a series of communications requesting payment is sent to a private payor who either is without healthcare benefit coverage or who owes us a co pay amount 
these communications increase in intensity and urgency as the receivable becomes more delinquent 
once the communication cycle is completed and the receivable remains uncollected  it is written off in our patient accounting system 
we also review accounts receivable events checklists which are designed to identify significant delinquent accounts receivable 
write offs for accounts identified by our events checklists are approved by the vice president of our patient services group 
write offs for accounts receivables have been relatively constant  but we can experience increases for specified events  primarily when we retain receivables for businesses we dispose of  such as our san antonio  certain questar centers and certain mid atlantic operations in 
table of contents impairment of goodwill  intangible and long lived assets goodwill goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are subject to at least annual assessments for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
we conduct our annual impairment fair value based test during the first quarter of each fiscal year 
we also review the recoverability of our goodwill on a quarterly basis  including a review of events or changes in circumstances that may indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
at december  the balance of goodwill  which relates entirely to our questar subsidiary operation  is approximately million 
intangible and long lived assets impairment losses are recognized for long lived assets through operations when events or changes in circumstances that may indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and the underlying net cash flows are not sufficient to support the assets carrying value 
examples of events or changes in circumstances or in the business climate can include  but are not limited to the following a 
history of operating losses or expected future losses b 
significant adverse change in legal factors c 
significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the assets are used or in the physical condition of the assets d 
current expectations to dispose of the assets by sale or other means e 
reductions or expected reductions of cash flow our medical services agreements  included in the consolidated balance sheets as intangible assets  are not considered to have indefinite useful lives and will continue to be amortized over a useful life of years based on sec guidance 
we regularly evaluate the carrying value and lives of the finite lived intangible assets in light of any events or circumstances that we believe may indicate that the carrying amount or amortization period should be adjusted 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
developing our provision for income taxes  including our effective tax rate  and analysis of potential tax exposure items  if any  requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  any estimated valuation allowances we deem necessary to value deferred tax assets 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we have significant noncurrent deferred tax assets at december  realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the twenty year loss carryforward period 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
our tax strategy to realize deferred tax assets resulting from the impairment of goodwill and long lived assets at certain of our questar centers  involves the future disposal of the remaining six questar centers we are currently operating at december  until we dispose of all our questar operations  we cannot  under the current tax regulations  deduct these particular impairment charges 
as of december   we plan to operate these six questar centers for the next few years  as long as they are profitable  however  we do not plan to invest in new equipment for these six centers 
at the point the cumulative operations begin to deteriorate  we will make a cost benefit decision in which we will compare the estimated future profitability of these centers to the potential tax benefits we could realize upon disposal

table of contents risk factors an investment in our common stock or notes involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risk factors listed below  as well as the other information included or incorporated in this report  before investing in our common stock or notes 
risks related to our company and our industry our revenue is dependent on referrals 
we generate most of our revenue from fees charged for the use of our diagnostic imaging equipment at our centers 
this revenue depends on referrals from third parties  many of which are made by physicians who have no contractual relationship with us 
we also generate revenue from service fees that we receive from the contracted radiology practices 
if a sufficiently large number of physicians discontinue referring patients to us  our procedure volume could decrease  which would reduce our revenue and operating margins 
further  commercial third party payors have implemented programs to control costs that could limit the ability of physicians to refer patients to us 
for example  prepaid healthcare plans  such as health maintenance organizations  in certain instances provide diagnostic imaging services directly and contract directly with providers and require their enrollees to obtain these services from only these providers 
some insurance companies and self insured employers also limit these services to contracted providers 
these closed panel systems are now common in the managed care environment 
other systems create an economic disincentive for referrals to providers outside of the system s designated panel of providers 
we may not be able to compete successfully for managed care contracts against entities with greater resources within a market area 
changes in third party payment rates or methods for diagnostic imaging services could create downward pricing pressure  which would result in a decline in our revenue and harm our financial position 
our revenue is derived through our ownership  operation and management of diagnostic imaging centers and from service fees paid to us by contracted radiology practices 
substantially all of the revenue of our diagnostic imaging centers and the contracted radiology practices is currently derived from commercial third party payors  government sponsored healthcare programs principally  medicare and medicaid and private and other payors 
for  revenue generated at our diagnostic imaging centers consisted of from managed care  from medicare and medicaid  and from private and other payors 
rates paid by commercial third party payors are based on established physician and hospital charges and are generally higher than medicare payment rates 
any decrease in the relative number of patients covered by commercial third party payors could decrease our revenue 
any change in the rates of or conditions for reimbursement from commercial third party payors  medicare or medicaid could substantially reduce the amounts reimbursed to us or our contracted radiology practices for services provided 
these reductions could have a significant adverse effect on our revenue and financial results by creating downward pricing pressure 
we could be harmed if the contracted radiology practices terminate their agreements with us or lose a significant number of radiologists 
our diagnostic imaging services include a professional component that must be provided by radiologists who are not directly employed by us 
we do not control the radiologists who perform professional services for us 
instead  these radiologists are employed by the contracted radiology practices that maintain agreements with us 
these agreements typically have terms of between and years  but may be terminated by either party under certain limited conditions 
depending on the termination event  the radiology practice may have the right to require us to sell  assign and transfer to it  the assets and related liabilities and obligations associated with the professional and technical radiology services provided by the radiology practice immediately prior to the termination 
the termination or material modification of any of them could reduce our revenue 
if a significant number of radiologists terminate their relationships with the contracted radiology practices and the radiology practices cannot recruit sufficient qualified radiologists to fulfill practice obligations under our agreements with them  our ability to maximize the use of our diagnostic imaging centers could be adversely affected  thereby decreasing our revenue 
competition in recruiting radiologists and a shortage of qualified radiologists has made it difficult for some contracted radiology practices to maintain adequate levels of radiologists 
neither we nor the contracted radiology practices maintain insurance on the lives of any affiliated physicians 
in  we terminated medical services agreements with contracted radiology practices in san antonio  texas and the mid atlantic 

table of contents our success is dependent on an operational turnaround 
we may be unable to successfully complete the operational turnaround of this company 
over the past year we have reviewed our overall operations  disposed of under performing operations  invested in strategic projects such as our reward program  authorized new equipment expenditures  increased marketing initiatives and placed greater focus on physician advisory board pab communications which involve meetings planned throughout the year with representatives of our contracted radiology practices to discuss strategic initiatives in the market place 
there can be no assurance that these actions  or future actions that we may take  will successfully turnaround the operations of the company 
we may not be able to successfully complete our market development plans 
we intend to increase our presence in existing markets through acquisitions of centers  developing de novo centers and adding additional equipment at existing centers  establishing additional joint venture and outsourcing relationships and selectively entering into contractual relationships with high quality  profitable radiology practices 
we may not be able to expand either within our existing markets or in new markets 
in addition  any expansion may not be beneficial to our overall strategy  and any such expansion may not ultimately produce returns that justify our investment 
our ability to expand is dependent upon many factors  including our ability to identify attractive and willing candidates for acquisitions  joint ventures or outsourcing relationships  adapt our structure to comply with federal and state legal requirements affecting our arrangements with contracted radiology practices  including state prohibitions on fee splitting  corporate practice of medicine and self referrals  obtain regulatory approvals and certificates of need  where necessary  and comply with licensing and certification requirements applicable to our diagnostic imaging centers  the contracted radiology practices and the physicians associated with the contracted radiology practices  recruit a sufficient number of qualified radiology technologists  expand our infrastructure and management  and obtain adequate financing 
our ability to expand is also dependent on our ability to compete for opportunities 
we may not be able to compete effectively for the acquisition of diagnostic imaging centers  joint venture opportunities or other outsourcing relationships 
our competitors may have better established operating histories and greater resources than we do 
competitors may make it more difficult to complete acquisitions or joint ventures on terms beneficial to us 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including the following possible adverse effects on our operating results  diversion of management s attention and resources  failure to retain key personnel  difficulties in integrating new operations into our existing management infrastructure  amortization or write offs of acquired intangible assets  and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities 
additionally  although we will continue to structure our operations in an effort to comply with applicable antitrust laws  federal or state governmental authorities may view us as being dominant in a particular market and  therefore  cause us to divest ourselves of relationships or assets 
we and the contracted radiology practices may become subject to burdensome lawsuits 
we may be subject to professional liability claims  including  without limitation  for improper use or malfunction of our diagnostic imaging equipment 
our operations  as well as the services we provide on behalf of the contracted radiology practices  also may be subject to lawsuits for inappropriate use or disclosure of individually identifiable patient health information 
we maintain insurance policies with coverages that we believe are appropriate in light of the risks attendant to our business and consistent with industry practice 
we also require the contracted radiology practices to maintain professional liability insurance consistent with industry practice 
however  adequate liability insurance may not be available to us and the contracted radiology practices in the future at acceptable costs or at all 

table of contents providing medical services entails the risk of professional malpractice and other similar claims 
the physicians employed by the contracted radiology practices are from time to time subject to malpractice claims 
we structure our relationships with the practices under our agreements with them in a manner that we believe does not constitute the practice of medicine by us or subject us to professional malpractice claims for acts or omissions of physicians in the contracted radiology practices 
nevertheless  claims  suits or complaints relating to services provided by the contracted radiology practices may be asserted against us in the future  including malpractice 
any claim made against us not fully covered by insurance could be costly to defend against  result in a substantial damage award against us and divert the attention of our management from our operations  which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance 
in addition  claims might adversely affect our business or reputation 
we have assumed and succeeded to substantially all of the obligations of some of the operations that we have acquired 
therefore  claims may be asserted against us for events that occurred prior to these acquisitions 
in connection with our acquisitions  the sellers of the operations that we have acquired have agreed to indemnify us for certain claims 
however  we may not be able to collect payment under these indemnity agreements  which could affect us adversely 
most of our imaging modalities require the utilization of radiation  and certain imaging modalities utilize radioactive materials 
these operations generate regulated waste and could subject us to regulation  related costs and delays and potential liabilities for injuries or violations of environmental  health and safety laws 
most of our imaging modalities utilize radiation  and certain imaging modalities utilize radioactive material 
these operations generate medical and other regulated wastes 
storage  use and disposal of these materials and waste products present the risk of accidental environmental contamination and physical injury 
we are subject to federal  state and local regulations governing storage  handling and disposal of these materials 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these hazardous materials 
in the event of an accident  we would be held liable for any resulting damages  and any liability could exceed the limits of or fall outside the coverage of our insurance 
we may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms  or at all 
we could incur significant costs and the diversion of our management s attention to comply with current or future environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
we may experience competition from other diagnostic imaging companies 
this competition could adversely affect our revenue and our business 
the market for diagnostic imaging services is competitive 
we compete principally on the basis of our reputation for providing multiple modalities  our conveniently located centers and our cost effective  high quality diagnostic imaging services 
we compete locally with groups of radiologists and some non radiologist physician practices  established hospitals  clinics and certain other independent organizations that own and operate imaging equipment 
our major national competitors include alliance imaging  inc  insight health services corp  medical resources  inc  and medquest  inc some of our local or national competitors that provide diagnostic imaging services may now or in the future have access to greater financial resources than we do and may have access to newer more advanced equipment 
technological change in our industry could reduce the demand for our services and require us to incur significant costs to upgrade our equipment 
technological change in the diagnostic imaging industry has been gradual 
in the future  however  the development of new technologies or refinements of existing modalities may make our existing equipment technologically or economically obsolete  or cause a reduction in the value of  or reduce the need for  our services 
diagnostic imaging equipment is currently manufactured by numerous companies 
competition among manufacturers for a greater share of the diagnostic imaging equipment market may result in technological advances in the speed and imaging capacity of new equipment 
consequently  the obsolescence of our equipment may be accelerated 
we may not have the financial ability to acquire the new or improved equipment 
a failure to meet our capital expenditure requirements could adversely affect our business 
we operate in a capital intensive  high fixed cost industry that requires significant amounts of capital to fund operations  particularly the initial start up and development expenses of new diagnostic imaging centers and the acquisition of additional centers and new diagnostic imaging equipment 
we incur capital expenditures to  among other things upgrade and replace existing equipment  purchase new diagnostic imaging equipment  and expand within our existing markets and enter new markets 
to the extent we are unable to generate sufficient cash from our operations  funds are not available under our credit facility or we are unable to structure or obtain operating leases  we may be unable to meet our capital expenditure requirements 
furthermore  we may not be able to raise any necessary additional funds through bank financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities on terms acceptable to us  if at all 

table of contents our success depends in part on our key personnel and we may not be able to retain sufficient qualified personnel 
our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified senior and executive management  managerial and technical personnel 
competition in recruiting these personnel may make it difficult for us to continue our growth and success 
the loss of their services or our inability in the future to attract and retain management and other key personnel could hinder the implementation of our business strategy 
we do not maintain key person insurance for any of our executive officers 
recently  there has been a shortage in certain of our markets of qualified radiology technologists  the personnel who operate our equipment 
if we are unable to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified technologists  we will be unable to operate our centers at maximum capacity or we will be forced to staff our diagnostic imaging centers with temporary personnel  thereby increasing our operating costs and reducing our operating margin profitability 
our inability to enforce non compete agreements with the radiologists may increase competition 
each of the contracted radiology practices under our comprehensive services model has entered into agreements with its physician shareholders and full time employed radiologists that generally prohibit those shareholders and radiologists from competing for a period of two years within defined geographic regions after they cease to be owners or employees  as applicable 
in most states  a covenant not to compete will be enforced only to the extent it is necessary to protect a legitimate business interest of the party seeking enforcement  if it does not unreasonably restrain the party against whom enforcement is sought  and if it is not contrary to public interest 
enforceability of a non compete covenant is determined by a court based on all of the facts and circumstances of the specific case at the time enforcement is sought 
for this reason  it is not possible to predict whether  or to what extent  a court will enforce the contracted radiology practices covenants 
the inability of the contracted radiology practices or us to enforce radiologists non compete covenants could result in increased competition from individuals who are knowledgeable about our business strategies and operations 
it is difficult to estimate our uncollectible accounts receivable and contractual allowances for billed charges  which may impact our earnings 
due to the complex nature of billing for healthcare services  it is difficult for us to estimate our uncollectible accounts receivable and our contractual allowances for billed charges 
if we have to revise our estimates and our existing reserves are not adequate  this may impact our earnings 
our ability to maximize the use of our diagnostic imaging equipment may be subject to seasonality 
during the summer months our average daily diagnostic imaging procedures decrease  which reduces our service fee revenues during those months 
the decrease in average daily diagnostic imaging procedures may have resulted from referring physicians or their patients taking vacation 
we cannot give any assurance that our future procedure volume and service fee revenues will not be affected by similar circumstances during the summer months or other traditional vacation times of the year 
severe weather conditions can adversely affect our operations 
we cannot give any assurance that our future procedure volume and service fee revenues will not be adversely affected by weather related interruptions 
managed care contracts and capitated fee arrangements could reduce our operating margins 
under capitated or other risk sharing arrangements  the healthcare provider typically is paid a pre determined amount per patient per month from the payor in exchange for providing all necessary covered services to patients covered under the arrangement 
these contracts pass much of the financial risk of providing outpatient diagnostic imaging services  including the risk of over use  from the payor to the provider 
our success will depend in part on our ability to negotiate effectively  on behalf of the contracted radiology practices and the diagnostic imaging centers that we own  operate or manage  contracts with hmos  employer groups and other third party payors for services to be provided on a risk sharing or capitated basis by some or all of the radiology practices and or diagnostic imaging centers 
risk sharing arrangements result in better revenue predictability  but more unpredictability of expenses and  consequently  profitability 
we may not be able to negotiate satisfactory arrangements on a capitated or other risk sharing basis  on behalf of our diagnostic imaging centers or the contracted radiology practices 
in addition  to the extent that patients or enrollees covered by these contracts require more frequent or extensive care than anticipated  we would incur unanticipated costs not offset by additional revenue  which would reduce operating margins 

table of contents we may be unable to generate revenue when our equipment is not operational 
timely  effective service is essential to maintaining our reputation and high utilization rates on our imaging equipment 
our warranties and maintenance contracts do not compensate us for loss of revenue when our systems are not fully operational 
equipment manufacturers may not be able to perform repairs or supply needed parts in a timely manner 
thus  if we experience more equipment malfunctions than anticipated or if we are unable to promptly obtain the service necessary to keep our equipment functioning effectively  our revenue could decline and our ability to provide services would be harmed 
our corporate organizational documents could discourage acquisition proposals and make difficult a change of control 
certain provisions of radiologix s restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  radiologix s amended and restated bylaws and delaware law could discourage potential acquisition proposals  delay or prevent a change in control of radiologix and  consequently  limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
these provisions include the inability to remove directors except for cause and our ability to issue  without further stockholder approval  shares of preferred stock with rights and privileges senior to the common stock 
we are also subject to section of the delaware general corporation law which  subject to certain exceptions  prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for three years after the stockholder became an interested stockholder 
we have also entered into written employment agreements with our chief executive officer and president  senior vice president  general counsel and secretary and senior vice president and chief financial officer  which contain provisions that require us to pay certain amounts to the executives upon their termination following a change of control 
these agreements may delay or prevent a change of control of radiologix 
risks relating to government regulation of our business state and federal anti kickback and anti self referral laws may adversely affect our income 
various federal and state laws govern financial arrangements among healthcare providers 
the federal anti kickback law prohibits the knowing and willful offer  payment  solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for  or to induce  the referral of medicare  medicaid  or other federal healthcare program patients  or in return for  or to induce  the purchase  lease or order of items or services that are covered by medicare  medicaid  or other federal healthcare programs 
similarly  many state laws prohibit the solicitation  payment or receipt of remuneration in return for  or to induce the referral of patients in private as well as government programs 
violation of these anti kickback laws may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties for individuals or entities and or exclusion from federal or state healthcare programs 
we believe that we are operating in compliance with applicable law and believe that our arrangements with providers would not be found to violate the anti kickback laws 
however  these laws could be interpreted in a manner inconsistent with our operations 
federal law prohibiting physician self referrals the stark law prohibits a physician from referring medicare or medicaid patients to an entity for certain designated health services if the physician has a prohibited financial relationship with that entity  unless an exception applies 
certain radiology services are considered designated health services under the stark law 
although we believe that our operations do not violate the stark law  our activities may be challenged 
if a challenge to our activities is successful  it could have an adverse effect on our operations 
in addition  legislation may be enacted in the future that further addresses medicare and medicaid fraud and abuse or that imposes additional requirements or burdens on us 
all of the states in which our diagnostic imaging centers are located have adopted a form of anti kickback law and almost all of those states have also adopted a form of stark law 
the scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities  each with broad discretion 
a determination of liability under the laws described in this risk factor could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions 
enforcement of federal and state privacy and associated laws may adversely affect our income 
how providers and their business associates use and disclose certain healthcare information has come under increasing public sensitivity and scrutiny 
additional risks for healthcare providers and their business associates are posed by the new hipaa federal standards  which set forth guidelines concerning how individually identifiable health information may be used and disclosed 
historically  state law has governed confidentiality issues 
but as a result of the enactment of hipaa  some states are considering revisions to their existing laws and regulations 
these changes may or may not be consistent with the federal hipaa provisions 
as a provider of healthcare services  we must conform to all applicable laws  both federal and state 
we believe that our operations are compliant with these legal standards 
nevertheless  these laws and regulations are new and few have been interpreted by government regulators or courts 
consequently  our interpretations and activities may be challenged 
if a challenge to our activities is successful  it could have an adverse effect on our operations 

table of contents federal false claims act violations could affect our participation in government programs 
the federal false claims act provides  in part  that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly presented  or caused to be presented  a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government  or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved 
the federal false claims act further provides that a lawsuit there under may be initiated in the name of the united states by an individual who is an original source of the allegations 
the government has taken the position that claims presented in violation of the federal anti kickback law or stark law may be considered a violation of the federal false claims act 
penalties include fines ranging from  to  for each false claim  plus three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person 
we believe that we are in compliance with the rules and regulations that apply to the federal false claims act 
however  we could be found to have violated certain rules and regulations resulting in sanctions under the federal false claims act 
if we are found in violation  any sanctions imposed could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on and exclusions from participation in federal and state healthcare programs that are integral to our business 
our agreements with the contracted radiology practices must be structured to avoid the corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting 
the laws of many states  including many of the states in which the contracted radiology practices are located  prohibit us from exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of physicians and from engaging in certain financial arrangements  such as splitting professional fees with physicians 
these laws and their interpretations vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities  each with broad discretion 
a component of our business has been to enter into service agreements with radiology practices 
we provide management  administrative  technical and other non medical services to the radiology practices in exchange for a service fee 
we structure our relationships with the radiology practices  including the purchase of diagnostic imaging centers  in a manner that we believe keeps us from engaging in the practice of medicine or exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of the radiology practices or their physicians or violating the prohibitions against fee splitting 
state regulatory authorities or other parties may assert that we are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or that the payment of service fees to us by the radiology practices constitutes fee splitting 
if such a claim were successfully asserted  we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and could be required to restructure or terminate the applicable contractual arrangements 
this result  or our inability to successfully restructure our relationships to comply with these statutes  could jeopardize our business strategy 
licensing and certification laws may limit our ability to expand 
ownership  construction  operation  expansion and acquisition of diagnostic imaging centers are subject to various federal and state laws  regulations and approvals concerning licensing of centers  personnel  certificates of need and other required certificates for certain types of healthcare centers and major medical equipment 
the laws of some of the states in which we operate limit our ability to acquire new diagnostic imaging equipment or expand or replace our existing equipment at diagnostic imaging centers in those states 
in addition  free standing diagnostic imaging centers that provide services that are not performed as part of a physician office must meet medicare requirements to be certified as an independent diagnostic testing facility to bill the medicare and medicaid programs 
we may not be able to receive the required regulatory approvals for any future acquisitions  expansions or replacements  and the failure to obtain these approvals could limit the market for our services 
the regulatory framework is uncertain and evolving 
healthcare laws and regulations may change significantly in the future 
we continuously monitor these developments and modify our operations from time to time as the regulatory environment changes 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be able to adapt our operations to address new regulations or that new regulations will not adversely affect our business 
in addition  although we believe that we are operating in compliance with applicable federal and state laws  neither our current or anticipated business operations nor the operations of the contracted radiology practices have been the subject of judicial or regulatory interpretation 
we cannot assure you that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in a determination that could adversely affect our operations or that the healthcare regulatory environment will not change in a way that restricts our operations 
certain states have enacted statutes or adopted regulations affecting risk assumption in the healthcare industry  including statutes and regulations that subject any physician or physician network engaged in risk based managed care contracting to applicable insurance laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations may require physicians and physician networks to meet minimum capital requirements and other safety and soundness requirements 
implementing additional regulations or compliance requirements could result in substantial costs to us and the contracted radiology practices and limits our ability to enter into capitated or other risk sharing managed care arrangements 

table of contents we could be harmed if payors are unable to comply with hipaa standard transaction and code set requirements 
the administrative provisions of hipaa direct the federal government to adopt national electronic standards for automated transfer of certain healthcare data between healthcare payors  plans and providers 
hipaa is designed to enable the entire healthcare industry to communicate electronic data using a single set of standards  thus eliminating all nonstandard formats currently in use 
our contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers are covered entities under hipaa  and as such  have to comply with the hipaa electronic data interchange mandates 
a failure in our continued ability to comply with hipaa standards or the discontinuance of cms or payor contingency plans could cause us to experience a delay in claims processing by its payors or lead to a large number of rejected or denied claims 
either of these results may slow our cash collections and increase our accounts receivable days sales outstanding 
risks related to indebtedness our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations on our notes or notes issued to replace them 
at december   we had approximately million of indebtedness 
in addition  we have the ability to borrow up to million under our credit facility 
also  subject to restrictions in the indenture and the credit facility  we may incur additional indebtedness 
our high level of indebtedness could have important consequences  including the following our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired  we must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest on our notes and our other indebtedness  which will reduce the funds available to us for other purposes  all of the indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and will mature prior to any notes  our high level of indebtedness could place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt  and our high level of indebtedness makes us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business 
we expect to obtain the money to pay our expenses and to pay the amounts due under our notes and other debt from our operations  borrowings under our credit facility and new borrowings 
our ability to meet our expenses depends on our future performance  which will be affected by financial  business  economic and other factors 
we will not be able to control many of these factors  such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and pressure from competitors 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future  our currently anticipated growth in revenue and cash flow may not be realized on schedule and future borrowings may not be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay indebtedness  including our notes  or to fund other liquidity needs 
if we do not have enough money  we may be required to refinance all or part of our then existing debt including our notes  sell assets or borrow more money 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
in addition  the terms of existing or future debt agreements  including our credit facility and any indenture  may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives 
the failure to generate sufficient cash flow or to achieve these alternatives could significantly adversely affect the value of our notes and our ability to pay the amounts due under them 
because our notes are unsecured  the right to enforce remedies is limited by the rights of holders of secured debt 
our notes are not secured 
our credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and a pledge of the capital stock of all of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
if we become insolvent or are liquidated  or if any payment under the credit facility is accelerated  our lenders will be entitled to exercise the remedies available to a secured lender under applicable law and will have a claim on those assets before the holders of any notes 
the liquidation value of our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full any indebtedness under the credit facility  as well as our other indebtedness  including our notes 
our ability to repay our notes and our other debt depends on cash flow from our subsidiaries  some of which are not obligated to make funds available to make payments on notes 
we are a holding company 
our only material assets are our ownership interests in our subsidiaries 
consequently  we depend on distributions or other intercompany transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service and other obligations  including with respect to our notes 
our non guarantor subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available for payment on our notes 
only our subsidiaries that are not unrestricted subsidiaries will guarantee our notes 
the financial statements included in this report are presented on a consolidated basis  including all of our subsidiaries 
the aggregate total assets at december  of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors of our notes were million  or of our total assets 
table of contents at december  the operating results of our guarantor subsidiaries may not be sufficient to enable us to make payments on our notes 
in addition  our rights and the rights of our creditors  including holders of our notes  to participate in the assets of any of our non guarantor subsidiaries upon their liquidation or recapitalization will generally be subject to the prior claims of those subsidiaries creditors 
as a result  our notes are effectively subordinated to the indebtedness of the non guarantor subsidiaries 
as of december   the total liabilities of our non guarantor subsidiaries  excluding intercompany liabilities  were million  or of our total liabilities 
the indenture for our notes and our credit facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions  which may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and taking certain actions 
the indenture for our notes and our credit facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions limit our ability to  among other things borrow money  pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase our stock  make investments  create liens  sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies  enter into certain transaction with affiliates  sell stock in our subsidiaries  and restrict dividends  distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries 
if we are unable to access the full million under our credit facility  our ability to meet our capital expenditure requirements may be restricted 
our borrowing availability under our million credit facility is determined through a formula  which allows us to borrow up to of eligible accounts receivable  as defined under the credit facility 
if we are unable to generate sufficient eligible accounts receivable  then we may not be able to borrow the full million 
at december  we had million available for borrowing 
to the extent that financing under the credit facility  or other financing sources is not available to us or we are not able to generate sufficient cash through operations  we may be restricted in our ability to meet capital expenditure requirements 
a court could cancel the guarantees under certain circumstances 
each of our subsidiaries that is not an unrestricted subsidiary guarantees our notes 
if  however  a guarantor becomes a debtor in a case under the united states bankruptcy code or encounters other financial difficulty  under federal or state fraudulent conveyance laws a court might avoid that is  cancel its guarantee 
the court might do so if it found that  when the guarantor entered into its guarantee or  in some states  when payments became due under its guarantee  it i received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the guarantee and ii either a was or was rendered insolvent  b was left with inadequate capital to conduct its business  or c believed or should have believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay 
the court might also avoid a guarantee  without regard to the above factors  if it found that the guarantor entered into its guarantee with actual intent to hinder  delay  or defraud its creditors 
a court would likely find that a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee unless it benefited directly or indirectly from the issuance of our notes 
if a court avoided a guarantee  a note holder would no longer have a claim against the guarantor 
in addition  the court might direct a note holder to repay any amounts already received from the guarantor 
if the court were to avoid any guarantor s guarantee  we cannot assure a note holder that funds would be available to pay our notes from another guarantor or from any other source 
the test for determining solvency for purposes of the foregoing will depend on the law of the jurisdiction being applied 
in general  a court would consider an entity insolvent either if the sum of its existing debts exceeds the fair value of all its property  or if the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts as they become due 
for this analysis  debts includes contingent and unliquidated debts 
the indenture states that the liability of each guarantor on its guarantee is limited to the maximum amount that the subsidiary can incur without risk that the guarantee will be subject to avoidance as a fraudulent conveyance 
this limitation may not protect the guarantees from a fraudulent conveyance attack or  if it does  that the guarantees will be in amounts sufficient  if necessary  to pay obligations under our notes when due 

table of contents we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to holders of our notes upon a change of control 
upon the occurrence of a change of control  as defined in our indenture  a note holder will have the right to require us to purchase our notes at a price equal to of the principal amount  together with any accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages  if any  to the date of purchase 
our failure to purchase  or give notice of purchase of  our notes would be a default under the indenture  which would in turn be a default under our senior credit facility 
moreover  our failure to repay all amounts outstanding under our senior credit facility upon a default would also be a default under the indenture 
in addition  a change of control may constitute an event of default under our credit facility 
a default under our credit facility will result in an event of default under the indenture if the lenders accelerate the debt under our senior credit facility 
if a change of control occurs  we may not have enough assets to satisfy all obligations under our credit facility and the indenture related to our notes 
upon the occurrence of a change of control  we could seek to refinance the indebtedness under our credit facility and our notes or obtain a waiver from the lenders or the note holders 
we may not be able to obtain a waiver or refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
no established trading market exists for our notes  and note holders may not be able to sell them quickly or at the price that note holders paid 
we do not intend to list our notes on any securities exchange or to arrange for quotation on any automated dealer quotation system 
jefferies company  inc and deutsche banc alex brown make a market in the notes  but they are not obligated to do so 
they may discontinue any market making at any time  in their sole discretion 
as a result  we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any trading market for the notes 
note holders may not be able to sell notes at a particular time or at favorable prices 
we also cannot assure note holders as to the level of liquidity of the trading market for the notes 
as a result  note holders may be required to bear the financial risk of their investment in the notes indefinitely 
future trading prices of the notes may be volatile and will depend on many factors  including our operating performance and financial condition  the interest of securities dealers in making a market for our notes  and the market for similar securities 
there are inherent limitations in all control systems  and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
company management continues to monitor our controls to assure compliance with the internal controls  disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud 
an internal control system  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
in addition  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within the company have been detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be challenged and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
further  controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more persons  or by management override of controls 
the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
over time  a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
because of inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected
