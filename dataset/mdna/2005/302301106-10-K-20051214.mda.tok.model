margins on merchandise sales increased of a percentage point as a result of less discounting and lower loan values on forfeited collateral 
jewelry scrapping margins improved percentage points due largely to gold prices rising at a faster rate than the company s increases in gold loan and purchase values

seasonality historically  service charge revenues are highest in the company s first fiscal quarter october through december due to improving loan redemption rates coupled with a higher average loan balance following the summer lending season 
sales generally are highest in the company s first and second fiscal quarters october through march due to the holiday season and the impact of tax refunds 
sales volume can be heavily influenced by the timing of decisions to scrap excess jewelry inventory  which generally occurs during low jewelry sales periods may through october 
the net effect of these factors is that net revenues and net income typically are highest in the first and second fiscal quarters 
the company s cash flow is greatest in its second fiscal quarter primarily due to a high level of loan redemptions and sales in the income tax refund season

the impact on the company s results of operations and financial position of a hypothetical change in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the us pound cannot be reasonably estimated due to the interrelationship of operating results and exchange rates 
the translation adjustment representing the weakening in the uk pound during the year ended june  included in the company s september  results on a three month lag as described above was approximately a  decrease  net of tax effect  to shareholders equity 
on september   the uk pound weakened to to uk dollars from at june  no assurance can be given as to the future valuation of the uk pound and how further movements in the pound could affect future earnings or the financial position of the company
