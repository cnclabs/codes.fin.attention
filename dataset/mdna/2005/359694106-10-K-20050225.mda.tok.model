item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview when reviewing the company s operating results it is important to understand how key external factors impact the company s financial results 
these factors include  economic growth rates  especially in north america and europe  global supply and demand for raw materials  the price changes of crude oil and natural gas  and currency exchange rates in  the company generated percent of its revenue in north america and percent in europe 
the pace of economic growth in these regions has a direct impact on the revenues of certain business units in the company 
within the global adhesives operating segment  the revenues of the assembly  converting and automotive business units are especially sensitive to the economic growth rates 
customers of the assembly business include manufacturers of furniture  appliances and other durable goods that are sensitive to the fluctuations in economic activity 
the converting business unit generates its revenue from companies that produce packaging materials such as corrugated boxes  which are in lower demand as economic activity slows down 
other business units within global adhesives that are not as susceptible to fluctuations in economic growth are the nonwoven and packaging business units 
nonwoven customers are primarily manufacturers of personal hygiene products and the packaging business unit generates a high percentage of its revenue from the food and beverage industry 
in the full valu specialty operating segment the powder coatings business  which sells to manufacturers of appliances  office equipment  lawn and garden equipment and other products made with metals is the most sensitive to overall economic growth rates 
the windows business unit and ceramic tile installation product line  both within the full valu specialty segment  are sensitive to more specific economic indicators such as housing starts in the us historically  price changes of crude oil and natural gas have been the most significant external factors influencing the company s cost of raw materials 
many of the company s raw materials are petroleum based derivatives and are therefore subject to the fluctuations in the commodity prices 
the increased energy costs in did have a significant impact on the company s raw material cost increases 
in addition to the impact from energy prices  raw material supply and demand issues had an even larger impact on the company s cost increases 
as global demand increased  especially from high growth regions such as asia  supplies became tight and certain raw materials were put on allocation in the second half of the company was able to meet all of its customers demands 
with upwards of million in annual purchases of raw materials and containers  managing these cost increases through effective selling price strategies is critical to the financial success of the company 
the movement of foreign currency exchange rates impacts the translation of the foreign entities financial statements into us dollars 
in  due primarily to the significant strengthening of the euro against the us dollar  currency rate changes increased the company s net revenue by percent  or over million as compared to the strengthening of other currencies against the us dollar such as the japanese yen  australian dollar  british pound and canadian dollar also contributed to the net revenue increase in the stronger foreign currencies also caused us dollar increases in cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately million 
the resulting increase in net income before income taxes of over million translated into an estimated increase in earnings per share of 
the company had several positive accomplishments in from a financial standpoint  cash flow generation showed excellent improvement 
free cash flow  defined as net cash provided from operating activities  less cash outlays for capital expenditures and dividends  was million in as compared to approximately million 
table of contents in effective february  the company acquired the adhesives and resins businesses of probos  sa based in oporto  portugal  expanding its geographic reach in the iberian peninsula 
annualized net revenue from the purchased businesses is approximately million 
the implementation of the lean six sigma sm methodology for process improvements provided significant benefits in its first year of deployment 
on january   the company determined that it was unable to reconcile certain balance sheet accounts relating to its chilean operations 
the audit committee of the company s board of directors conducted an independent investigation into the accounting and financial reporting matters at the company s chilean operations 
the audit committee engaged special counsel and an independent accounting firm to assist in its investigation and report on this matter 
the investigation indicated that certain members of the local accounting organization knowingly recorded incorrect entries to certain accounts in the chilean financial statements 
furthermore  the investigation indicated a portion of these accounting irregularities involved the misappropriation of company assets 
the impact of these actions  which the investigation indicated began in fiscal year  resulted in the cumulative overstatement of net income through august  totaling million 
of this amount  million related to overstatements occurring prior to fiscal year the amounts relating to prior year periods were determined to be immaterial to the respective prior year periods and and  accordingly  were recorded in the fourth quarter of the remaining million represented misstatements in fiscal year of which  million and million occurred in the second and third quarters  respectively 
the second and third quarters of are restated as shown in note critical accounting policies and significant estimates management s discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management believes the critical accounting policies and areas that require the most significant judgments and estimates to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are pension and other postretirement plan assumptions  goodwill recoverability  product  environmental and other litigation liabilities and income tax accounting 
pension and other postretirement plan assumptions the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans in both us and foreign entities 
also in the us the company sponsors other postretirement plans for health care and life insurance costs 
expenses and liabilities for the pension plans and other postretirement plans are actuarially calculated 
these calculations are based on management s assumptions related to the discount rate  expected return on assets  projected salary increases and healthcare cost trend rates 
the annual measurement date for these assumptions is august note to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these assumptions for both the non us and non us plans 
the discount rate assumption is tied to a long term high quality bond index and is therefore subject to annual fluctuations 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the pension obligations  which results in higher pension expense 
the discount rate in the us was percent at august  as compared to percent at august  and percent at august  a discount rate reduction of percentage points increases pension and other postretirement plan expense pretax approximately million 
discount rates for non us plans are determined in a manner consistent with the us plan 
the expected return on assets assumption on the investment portfolios for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans is based on the long term expected returns for the investment mix of assets currently in the portfolio 
because the rate of return is a long term assumption  it generally does not change each year 
management uses historic return trends of the asset portfolio combined with recent market conditions to estimate the future rate of return 
the current investment mix in the us portfolios is nearly percent in us equities 

table of contents from through  the company used an expected return on assets assumption for the us portfolio of percent 
at august   given the poor performance of the us equity markets in and  management lowered the expected rate of return assumption to percent 
this rate was used in calculating the expenses for and and will also be used for a change of percentage points for the expected return assumption will impact us net pension and other postretirement plan expense pretax by approximately million 
expected return on asset assumptions for non us plans are determined in a manner consistent with the us plan 
the projected salary increase assumption is based on historic trends and comparisons to the external market 
higher rates of increase result in higher pension expenses 
as this rate is also a long term expected rate it is less likely to change on an annual basis 
in the us  management has used the rate of percent for the past three years 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a purchase business combination 
as of november   the company s balance sheet included approximately million of goodwill 
the goodwill is primarily included in the global adhesives operating segment 
sfas no 
requires the company to test goodwill for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status 
impairment testing compares the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill to the net asset carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists 
the calculations confirmed that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the net asset carrying values for all reporting units 
management judgment is required in calculating the fair value of the reporting units 
the calculation uses a discounted cash flow analysis that requires management to project financial performance and related cash flows 
the projections are based on management s best estimate given recent financial performance  market trends  strategic plans and other available information 
future results will most likely differ from the projected results 
however  based on the margin that fair value exceeded the net asset carrying value of the various reporting units  management does not anticipate a material impact on the company s financial results from differences in these assumptions 
product  environmental and other litigation liabilities as disclosed in item and in note and note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is subject to various claims  lawsuits and other legal proceedings 
accruals for loss contingencies associated with these matters are made when it is determined that a liability is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the assessment of the probable liabilities is based on the facts and circumstances known at the time that the financial statements are being prepared 
for cases in which it is determined that a liability has been incurred but only a range for the potential loss exists  the minimum amount of the range is recorded and subsequently adjusted  as better information becomes available 
for cases in which insurance coverage is available  the gross amount of the estimated liabilities is accrued and a receivable is recorded for any probable estimated insurance recoveries 
in the eifs litigation involving single family homes referred to in note  million for the potential liabilities and million for potential insurance recoveries were accrued 
the company also has accrued million for potential liabilities and million for potential insurance recoveries related to the asbestos settlement also discussed in note as of november   the company had reserved an additional million for all other pending matters 
based upon currently available facts  management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of any pending legal proceeding  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  adverse developments could negatively impact earnings or cash flows in a particular future period 
income tax accounting as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
the process 
table of contents involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
management records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
management has considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
increases in the valuation allowance result in additional expense to be reflected within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
at november   the valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets totaled million 
results of operations compared to and net revenue net revenue in of  million increased million or percent from the net revenue of  million 
the net revenue was million or percent above the net revenue of  million in management reviews variances in net revenue in terms of changes related to product pricing  sales volume  acquisitions divestitures and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the following table shows the net revenue variance analysis for the past two years decrease vs vs sales volume product pricing acquisitions divestitures currency total improved global economic activity in as compared to was an important factor in the growth in sales volume 
although selling price increases began to take hold in the fourth quarter of  it was not enough to stop the overall average price reductions for the year 
the adhesives market continued to be one of intense competition for volume  especially in water based technologies 
the positive currency effects on net revenue in both and were driven primarily by the stronger euro as compared to the us dollar 
the value of one euro as compared to the us dollar at each of the past three fiscal year end dates has been as follows november  november  november  approximately percent of the company s net revenue was generated from euro denominated transactions 
in the global adhesives operating segment net revenue increased by percent in as compared to included in the global adhesives net revenue growth was the positive effects from currency exchange rates of percent  average selling price decreases of percent and increases due to the acquisition of new businesses in portugal of percent

the effects from currency fluctuations increased the cost of sales by approximately million as compared to other key components of the increase in cost of sales 
table of contents were increased sales volume  raw material cost increases and the cost of sales on the net revenue generated from the acquired businesses in portugal 
the rapid increase in raw material costs was especially significant in the second half of in prior years the main factors impacting the company s cost of raw materials were energy prices as the company uses many petroleum based raw materials in its products 
in however  it was not only the rising costs of crude oil and natural gas that impacted the company s costs  it was also increased demand from expanding regions such as asia that drove up the costs 
this increase in demand was occurring at a time of reduced capacity in the industry due to capacity shutdowns and minimal capital investment 
the cost of sales increases were mitigated somewhat by reduced costs resulting from the company s lean six sigma sm lss initiatives 
projects utilizing the lss methodology were successful in improving operating efficiencies and reducing waste in several of the company s processes 
the cost of sales in of million was million or percent more than the cost of sales of million in the cost of sales included million of costs related to the company s restructuring initiative and the cost of sales included million of costs related to the same initiative

this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements may be identified by the use of words like plan  expect  aim  believe  project  anticipate  intend  estimate  will  should  could including the negative or variations thereof and other expressions that indicate future events and trends 
these plans and expectations are based upon certain underlying assumptions  including those mentioned with the specific statements 
such assumptions are in turn based upon internal estimates and analyses of current market conditions and trends  management plans and strategies  economic conditions and other factors 
these plans and expectations and the assumptions underlying them are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions and results 
actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed in the forward looking statements if one or more of the underlying assumptions and expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized 
in addition to the factors described in this report  the following are some of the important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those in any such forward looking statements 
in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  the company hereby identifies important factors which could affect the company s financial performance and could cause the company s actual results for future periods to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward looking statements 
additionally  the variety of products sold by the company and the regions where the company does business makes it difficult to determine with certainty the increases or decreases in revenues resulting from changes in the volume of products sold  currency impact  changes in product mix and selling prices

these factors should be considered  together with any similar risk factors or other cautionary language which may be made elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
competition a wide variety of products are sold in numerous markets  each of which is highly competitive 
the company s competitive position in the markets in which it participates is  in part  subject to external factors 
for example  supply and demand for certain of the company s products is driven by end use markets and worldwide capacities which  in turn  impact demand for and pricing of the company s products 
many of the company s direct competitors are part of large multi national companies and may have more resources than the company 
any increase in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices  which could result in reduced gross margins 
this may impair the ability to grow or even to maintain current levels of revenues and earnings

acquisitions as part of its growth strategy  the company intends to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses or products and joint ventures 
the ability to grow through acquisitions or joint ventures depends upon the company s ability to identify  negotiate and complete suitable acquisitions or joint venture arrangements 

table of contents international international operations could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions  trade protection measures  restrictions on repatriation of earnings  differing intellectual property rights and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs 
also  changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies could potentially result in increases or decreases in earnings and may adversely affect the value of the company s assets outside the united states 
although the company utilizes risk management tools  including hedging  as appropriate  to mitigate market fluctuations in foreign currencies  any changes in strategy in regard to risk management tools can also affect sales revenue  expenses and results of operations and there can be no assurance that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated 
raw materials raw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from a number of suppliers 
many of these raw materials are petroleum based derivatives  minerals and metals 
under normal market conditions  these materials are generally available on the open market from a variety of producers 
from time to time  however  the prices and availability of these raw materials fluctuate  which could impair the ability to procure necessary materials  or increase the cost of manufacturing products

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency rates and prices of raw materials 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk exposure to changes in interest rates result primarily from borrowing activities used to fund operations 
committed floating rate credit facilities are used to fund a portion of operations 
management believes that probable near term changes in interest rates would not materially affect consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the annual impact on the results of operations of a one percentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of its variable rate debt as of november  would be approximately million 
foreign exchange risk as a result of being a global enterprise  there is exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect operating results and financial position 
approximately percent of net revenue is generated outside of the united states 
principal foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  australian dollar  canadian dollar  argentine peso and brazilian real 
management s objective is to balance  where possible  local currency denominated assets to local currency denominated liabilities to have a natural hedge and minimize foreign exchange impacts 
the company enters into cross border transactions through importing and exporting goods to and from different countries and locations 
these transactions generate foreign exchange risk as they create assets  liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the local currency 
this also applies to services provided and other cross border agreements among subsidiaries 
management takes steps to minimize risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through normal operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative instruments 
during  additional processes were implemented in an effort to further minimize foreign exchange exposure 
management does not enter into any speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments 
note and note to the consolidated financial statements provide additional details regarding the management of foreign exchange risk 
from a sensitivity analysis viewpoint  based on financial results  a hypothetical overall percent change in the us dollar would have resulted in a change of approximately million in net income or per diluted share 
raw materials the principal raw materials used to manufacture products include resins  polymers  synthetic rubbers  vinyl acetate monomer and plasticizers 
the company generally avoids sole source supplier arrangements for raw materials 
while alternate supplies of most key raw materials are available  sustained strong economical growth in north america and china coupled with unplanned production outages have led to strained supply demand situations for several key feedstocks benzene and ethylene  some of their derivatives  several polymers and acrylate monomers 
in  the single largest expenditure was the purchase of raw materials 
management s objective is to purchase raw materials that meet both its quality standards and production needs at the lowest total cost 
most raw materials are purchased on the open market or under contracts that limit the frequency but not the magnitude of price increases 
in some cases  however  the risk of raw material price changes is managed by strategic sourcing agreements which limit price increases to increases in supplier feedstock costs  while requiring decreases as feedstock costs decline 
the leverage of having substitute raw materials approved for use wherever possible is used to minimize the impact of possible price increases
