item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop and distribute the fast forword family of reading intervention software 
our innovative products apply advances in neuroscience and cognitive research to build the fundamental cognitive skills required to read and learn 
extensive outcomes research by independent researchers  our founding scientists  and our company demonstrates that the fast forword products help students attain fast  lasting gains in the skills critical for reading 
to encourage best practices in the use of our products  we offer a variety of on site and remote professional and technical services  as well as phone  email and web based support 
our primary market is k schools in the united states  to which we sell using a direct sales force 
in  k schools accounted for of our booked sales 
by the end of  approximately  schools had purchased at least  of our fast forword product licenses and services  and over  individuals had enrolled in one of our products 
business highlights market trends the education market is growing 
eduventures  a strategic consulting firm in the education industry  has estimated that in  k schools spent billion on supplemental content  more than in  and projects that in  k schools will spend more on supplemental content than in the federal no child left behind nclb act of established reading achievement  grade level proficiency  and accountability through assessment as important national priorities 
nclb also emphasizes the need to use proven practices and products grounded in scientifically based research to improve student performance 
our products align well with the emphases of nclb  and we believe that this alignment assists us in marketing and selling our products 
the general availability of funding for public schools fluctuates from time to time 
in recent years state and local education funding has been negatively affected by reduced levels of tax revenues due to the economic slowdown  and the education technology industry has generally experienced soft sales  typically attributed to tight funding 
however  substantial federal funding resources remain  and many of those resources are focused on reading improvement 
eduventures estimates that total spending in the broad k learning market increased by during in fiscal  state revenue is generally improving  according to a recent survey by the national conference of state legislatures although states also face increasing budget pressures 
company highlights our total booked sales increased by over  and k booked sales increased 
our results were stronger than typical industry results in the k market and booked sales growth was within our target range of to 
for more explanation on booked sales  see  revenue  below 
we attribute our strong sales in a difficult market to our emphasis on reading improvement and measurable results  emphases which are shared by our k customers and aligned with nclb 
one of our major goals is to increase the number of large sales  which we believe to be an important indicator of mainstream education industry acceptance and an important factor in continuing to increase the productivity of our sales force 
during the second quarter  we closed a major contract with the school district of philadelphia  with a total contract price of million  of which million was recorded as booked sales 
the remainder of the contract s price represents future years of service and support  and is scheduled to be booked over the next four calendar years 
in  we closed transactions in excess of  compared to in our goal is to continue to increase this number in larger sales tend to have a longer sales cycle and involve more political influences and can be more unpredictable 
increases in the proportion of our business from these large sales may cause increased fluctuations and unpredictability in the timing of our sales and revenue 
in our revenue grew over to reach million 
this revenue growth was lower than sales growth in both and  which were and respectively 
this difference primarily reflects sales which are recognized into revenue over multiple years  which comprised a larger portion of our sales in and than in page 
table of contents prior years 
because of changes in our pricing structure and a resulting change in the timing of revenue recognition from perpetual license sales  we expect that revenue will grow faster than booked sales in we reported a net loss of million in  compared to million profit in this net loss results from higher expenses driven by increased sales and the timing lag between the completion of sales and recognition of revenue 
in  our goals include increasing both our net income and our profit margin 
to achieve these goals  we must increase our sales  achieve the necessary product mix  and improve sales force productivity 
we ended with no debt  the same as at year end during the year we borrowed and repaid million in debt 
because our generation and use of cash is seasonal  we borrowed money for working capital purposes in the first quarter of and may again do so from time to time 
net cash from operating and investing activities was million 
this was the third successive year of positive and increased cash flow from operations 
we expect to be cash flow positive from operations in while our goals for include increasing sales  revenue  profit and cash flow  we cannot assure you that we will achieve these goals 
see unpredictability below and business factors that may affect results of operations and stock price above 
results of operations revenue year ended december  dollars in thousands change change products service and support total revenues revenue compared to the decline in product revenue compared to was largely attributable to only modest growth in booked sales coupled with a shift in sales mix in towards multi year contracts with longer revenue recognition periods 
the majority of our product license sales are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized to revenue over the term of the licenses 
because the license term frequently crosses over two fiscal years  our license sales affected product revenue in both and product revenue in was also negatively affected by more volume discounts due to an increasing proportion of large sales in and our december strategic pricing change discussed in future revenue  below had little impact in  because the software for many december perpetual licenses was not delivered until january service and support revenues increased  primarily due to increased sales of on site services 
the sale and delivery of on site services to schools was a major focus for us in to enhance school implementations 
service and support revenue also increased as a result of the increase in the number of schools purchasing ongoing progress tracker access and support contracts 
revenue compared to the growth in product revenues in was largely attributable to an growth in booked sales and the continued impact of strong license sales 
the majority of our product license sales are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized to revenue over the term of the licenses 
because the license term frequently crosses over two fiscal years  our strong license sales positively affected product revenue in both and in addition  sales of our products with no internet connection feature increased in compared to  which had a positive impact on revenue because these sales were recognized into revenue over a shorter period than are products licensed with an internet connection feature 
service and support revenues increased  primarily due to increased sales of on site services 
the sale and delivery of on site services to schools was a major focus for us in to enhance school implementations 
service and support revenue also increased as a result of the increase in the number of schools on support contracts 
future revenue in december  we made a strategic change to our pricing structure  relating to our on line progress tracking tool  to encourage all customers to use this important capability 
prior to this change  we recognized revenue from sales of perpetual license packages that included our internet reporting tools over the longest service period included in the contract 
as a result of the change  we are now generally recognizing revenue from perpetual software licenses at the later of delivery or the contract start date 
see management s discussion and analysis  revenue recognition for more detail about our revenue recognition practices 
therefore  in we page 
table of contents expect to recognize a greater proportion of current sales into revenue than we did in at the same time  we will also be recognizing deferred revenue from earlier years perpetual license sales into current revenue 
we expect that this non recurring impact from our transition to a different pricing structure will result in revenue in growing at a faster rate than booked sales and at a faster rate than we currently project for revenue growth in booked sales and selling activity because a significant portion of our software  services and support revenue is recognized in periods after the invoice date  management uses booked sales to evaluate current selling activity 
booked sales is a non gaap financial measure that we believe is useful for investors as well as management as a measure of current demand for our products and services 
booked sales equals the total value net of allowances of software  services and support invoiced in the period 
we record booked sales and deferred revenue when all of the requirements for revenue recognition have been met  other than the requirement that the revenue for software licenses and services has been earned 
we use booked sales information for resource allocation  planning  compensation and other management purposes 
we believe that revenue is the gaap measurement closest to booked sales 
however  booked sales should not be considered in isolation from  and is not intended to represent  a substitute measure of revenue or any other performance measure calculated under gaap 
the following reconciliation table sets forth our booked sales  revenues and change in deferred revenue for the years ended december   and year ended december  dollars in thousands change change booked sales less revenue net increase in deferred revenue current and long term deferred revenue beginning of the period current and long term deferred revenue end of the period booked sales in the k sector  which accounted for of sales in  grew to million  compared to million in the increases were achieved in a difficult k market with tight state funding 
we sold  site license packages over  compared to in the same period in in we continued to focus our sales force on multi site sales 
the number of sales over  increased to in from in and in in  we had our first million sale  our largest sale to date  to the school district of philadelphia pa 
only million of this transaction was recorded as booked sales in the remaining million is scheduled to be recorded as booked sales in the coming four years 
in k sector booked sales increased by to million compared to million in the k sector represented of booked sales in  compared to in this growth reflects our strategy to expand in the k market 
booked sales outside the k market increased by in to million compared to million in and declined in from we believe these customers are affected by economic conditions and the improvement in is partially related to a recovery in disposable income 
our primary focus has been on the k market and we believe this focus contributed to the decline in we believe we have stabilized our sales to this market and expect to hold near this level in and may even experience modest growth due to increased sales to international customers and new product introductions 
unpredictability we believe that we are positioned to achieve continued growth in the k market during  although federal  state and local budget pressures continue to present an uncertain funding environment for our customers 
however  achieving our sales growth objectives will depend on increasing mainstream customer acceptance of our products  which requires us to continue to focus on improving our products ease of use  their fit with school requirements  and the engagement of classroom teachers and administrators with product implementations 
for a discussion of some of the other important factors that affect our results  see factors that may affect results of operations or stock price 
in addition  the revenue recognized from our sales can be unpredictable 
our various license and service packages have substantially differing revenue recognition periods  and it is often difficult to predict which license package a customer will purchase  even when the amount and timing page 
table of contents of a sale can be reasonably projected 
see management s discussion and analysis application of critical accounting policies for a discussion of our revenue recognition policy 
in addition  the timing of a single large order or its implementation can significantly impact the level of sales and revenue at any given time 
gross profit and cost of revenues year ended december  dollars in thousands gross profit on products gross profit margin on products gross profit on service and support gross profit margin on services and support total gross profit total gross profit margin the overall gross profit margin declined in compared to  as margin improvements in both products and services and support were more than offset by revenue mix changes 
service and support  which have a lower margin than products  increased to of revenue in compared to in product margins increased due to lower effective royalty rates and lower amortization of capitalized software 
product costs consist of manufacturing  packaging and fulfillment costs  amortization of capitalized software and royalties 
our margins in service and support increased from levels as higher revenue provided better fixed cost coverage 
in the first quarter of  we reorganized our service and support business to increase the number of employees available to provide service and support to our customers 
in addition  products tend to be more challenging to implement when they are first introduced 
we incurred additional service costs in the second half of and the first quarter of associated with our new gateway edition 
service and support costs consist primarily of the cost of personnel  materials and travel 
we do not expect to incur further expenses associated with gateway edition s initial technical problems 
in  overall gross margin declined compared to  due in large part to the reorganization of our service and support business in the first quarter of to increase the number of employees available to provide service and support to our customers 
in  we primarily used per diem consultants rather than full time employees to provide training services 
in  the gross margin on products increased due to slightly lower materials costs and amortization of capitalized software cost 
we expect that product margins will improve in due to lower amortization of capitalized software and a lower average royalty rate 
we also expect that service and support margins will improve due to better fixed cost coverage 
consequently we expect overall gross margins to improve in operating expenses year ended december  dollars in thousands change change sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring  lease and asset impairment write down n a n a  total operating expenses sales and marketing expenses in  our sales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to increased sales and marketing staff  more marketing activities and higher commissions reflecting higher sales 
sales and marketing expenses consist principally of salaries and incentive compensation paid to employees engaged in sales and marketing activities  travel costs  tradeshows  conferences  and marketing and promotional materials 
at december   we had quota bearing sales personnel selling to public schools 
in sales and marketing expenses decreased compared to  primarily due to the reclassification of some personnel from sales to our expanded service and support team as well as lower spending on conferences  trade shows and marketing materials 
page 
table of contents during  we expect to increase our investment in sales and marketing as we focus on increasing sales in the k market 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased in compared to  but were lower as a percentage of revenue 
the increase in research and development spending in compared to was primarily related to the introduction of gateway edition 
some of these costs did not recur in research and development expenses principally consist of compensation paid to employees and consultants engaged in research and product development activities and product testing  together with software and equipment costs 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in as we continue to invest in improving our current product suite  demonstrating product efficacy and introducing new products 
two new products in our fast forword to reading series and one new product in our language series are scheduled for launch in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased in primarily due to the expenses associated with the restatement of our financial results and to the addition of staff 
accounting and legal fees associated with the restatement totaled approximately  general and administrative expenses principally consist of salaries and compensation paid to our executives  accounting staff and other support personnel  as well as travel expenses for these employees  and outside legal and accounting fees 
general and administrative expenses decreased in compared to  primarily because of decreases in personnel and legal costs 
stock based compensation expense we are required to implement sfas r beginning january  this will require us to record compensation expense for employee stock awards 
we expect that the implementation of sfas r will significantly increase our operating expenses in the next few years 
restructuring  lease and asset impairment write downs in october we entered into a lease termination agreement with our landlord to terminate the lease on our oakland headquarters and entered into a new lease agreement for a reduced amount of space in the same building 
compared to the prior lease  the reduction in space is expected to reduce future lease payments by million net of lease termination fees described below through under the lease termination agreement we paid an increased security deposit of  and lease termination fees totaling  in the balance of the lease termination fees of million was paid in and all restructuring expenses have been paid as of december  during  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million  reflecting employee severance benefits and rent for excess office space 
the restructuring resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately employees and a total charge to operations for severance benefits of million 
most of the employees affected by the workforce reduction were located in our oakland office in the marketing and customer service departments 
due to continued weakness in the commercial real estate market in we recorded an additional charge for excess office space at our oakland headquarters of million 
this charge reflected adjustments to the assumptions on which the write down for excess office space had been made  including our assumptions about the time period that the excess office space would be vacant and potential sublease terms 
we calculated the estimated costs for the additional facilities restructuring charge based on current market information provided by a commercial real estate broker

amounts received to date and any future receipts are being reported as other income as we do not consider the sale of these rights to be part of recurring operations 
there was no comparable transaction for the same period of interest expense  net year ended december  dollars in thousands change change interest expense  net interest expense  net decreased in  compared to  and decreased in compared to the decreases in both years are due to progressively lower borrowing and  in  from lower amortization of deferred financing costs 
deferred financing costs were fully amortized in the quarter ended september  in we do not expect to pay any interest  as we do not anticipate borrowing during this will require us to achieve sales targets  which is uncertain  however 
deferred financing expense was  in compared to million in in  interest expense  net included  in interest income primarily from loans to current and former officers 
provision for income taxes the company recorded a tax benefit of  for the year ended december  relating to the reversal of a provision for us federal alternative minimum tax for the year ended december  the company has made no provision for us federal  us state or foreign income taxes for the years ended december   and as the company has incurred tax losses in all periods and for all jurisdictions 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
unutilized net operating loss carryforwards will expire in years through utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations 
previous or future equity transactions may result in such an ownership change 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before they become available to reduce future tax liabilities 
at december   we had approximately million of deferred tax assets  comprised primarily of net operating loss carryforwards 
page 
table of contents realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents were million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  during  and we generated cash flow from operations 
at december  there were no borrowings outstanding under our credit line 
we expect that our cash flow from operations and our current cash balances will be the primary source of the funds for our operations and capital expenditures during during  we plan to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations and to generate a profit 
however  accomplishing these objectives will require us to achieve specific sales targets in the k market 
we cannot assure you that we will meet our targets with respect to sales  revenues or operating results 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million  compared to million in net cash provided by operating activities increased in and primarily because booked sales increased at a faster rate than spending and our collection experience was good 
a million increase in deferred revenue with an offsetting accounts receivable increase of only million was a key driver in operating cash flow 
accounts receivable at year end was million in compared to million in net cash used in investing activities in was million  consisting primarily of computer hardware and software acquisition costs 
in  net cash used by investing activities was million  consisting primarily of an increase in non current assets for the deposit of  for our lease restructuring 
in  net cash of  was provided by investing activities  primarily from the sale of the million balance of our portfolio of government securities 
our capital expenditures of  were higher than in and  approximately  and  respectively 
in  we expect that our capital spending will be higher than in as we continue to upgrade computer equipment and purchase new software to improve operations 
financing activities generated million in  from the sale of stock upon option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan 
financing activities used million in cash in both and  primarily to pay down million  net  on our line of credit in both years  partially offset by cash raised from the sale of stock upon option exercises and through our employee stock purchase plan 
because our sales tend to be seasonal  we may have negative cash flows in particular quarters  particularly the first quarter  when sales tend to be substantially lower than in other quarters 
we borrowed money for working capital purposes in the first quarter of and may borrow again from time to time 
we have a line of credit with comerica bank totaling million  which expires on july  the facility initially totaled million and was partially secured by a letter of credit provided by wpv  inc  an affiliate of warburg  pincus ventures  our largest stockholder 
the letter of credit was for million through may  and million from may  to july  the wpv letter of credit expired on july  the line is subject to limitations based on our accounts receivable balance 
borrowings under the line are subject to various covenants  which may limit our financial and operating flexibility 
there is no borrowing currently outstanding under the line 
after  we expect that cash flow from operations will continue to be our primary source of funds for the next several years 
again  this will require us to achieve certain levels of sales 
if the company is unable to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow from operations  the company may seek other sources of debt or equity financing  or may be required to reduce expenses 
reducing the company s expenses could adversely affect its operations by reducing the resources available for sales  marketing  research or development efforts 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms

transaction with posit science corporation  formerly neuroscience solutions corporation in september  we signed an agreement with posit science corporation psc  transferring technology to psc for use in the health field 
the transaction includes a license of the patents we own  a sublicense of the patents we license from others  the license of certain software we developed  and the transfer of assets related to certain research projects 
all of the rights licensed to psc are limited to the health field and most are exclusive in that field 
we will continue to use the licensed patents and technology in the fields of education and speech and language therapy  and retain all rights to our technology outside of the health field 
we also agreed with psc that we would license one another certain patents that may be issued in the future  on which royalties would be paid  and that we would provide psc certain technology transfer  hosting and support services 
psc is a start up company located in san francisco that plans to develop  market  and sell a series of software based products for healthcare markets based on neuroplasticity research

application of critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  assumptions and judgments 
we page 
table of contents believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time 
the estimates  assumptions and judgments that we make can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our financial statements would be affected 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments pertaining to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  software development costs and long lived assets are the most critical assumptions to understand in order to evaluate our reported financial results 
a detailed discussion of our use of estimates  assumptions and judgments as they relate to these polices is presented below 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from the sale of licenses to our software and from service and support fees 
software license revenue is recognized in accordance with aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position sop 
sop provides specific industry guidance and four basic criteria  which must be met to recognize revenue 
these are persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery of the product  a fixed or determinable fee  and the probability that the fee will be collected 
sales to our school customers typically include multiple elements eg fast forword software licenses  progress tracker  our internet based participant tracking service  support  training  implementation management  and other services 
the company allocates revenue to each element of a transaction based upon its fair value as determined in reliance on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
vsoe of fair value for each element of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately and  for support services  is also measured by the renewal price 
the value of software licenses  services and support invoiced during a particular period is recorded as deferred revenue until recognized 
deferred revenue is recognized as revenue as discussed below 
license revenue 
revenue from the licensing of software is recognized as follows perpetual licenses software licensed on a perpetual basis 
revenue is recognized at the later of product delivery date or contract start date using the residual method 
if vsoe does not exist for all the undelivered elements  all revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the service period if the undelivered element is services or when all elements have been delivered 
term licenses software licensed for a specific time period  generally three to twelve months 
revenue is recognized ratably over the license term 
individual participant licenses software licensed for a single participant 
revenue is recognized over the average period of use  typically six weeks 
service and support revenue 
service and support revenue is derived from a combination of training  implementation  technical and professional services  online services and customer support 
training  technical and other professional services are typically sold on a per day basis 
if vsoe exists for all elements of an arrangement or all elements except software licenses  services revenue is recognized as performed 
if vsoe does not exist for all the elements in an arrangement except software licenses  service revenue is recognized over the longest contractual period in an arrangement 
revenue from services sold alone or with support is recognized as performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses due to the inability of customers to make payments 
these estimates are based on historical experience 
in early our experience was that bad debt expense was about of revenue 
in the later half of and our bad debt experience improved significantly to less than of revenue and in the th quarter of we adjusted our bad debt allowance to reflect page 
table of contents the improvement in our experience 
our experience was consistent with the late and experience and we did not adjust our reserve policy in to the extent experience requires it  we may in the future again adjust this reserve 
cancellations and refunds are allowed in limited circumstances  and such amounts have not been significant 
software development costs we capitalize software development costs in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  under which software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of the related product 
prior to the establishment of technological feasibility we expense all software development cost associated with a product 
technological feasibility is deemed established upon completion of a working version 
we estimate the useful life of our developed products to be three years 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the net realizable value of the capitalized software development cost by estimating the future revenue to be generated from the product and compare this estimate to the unamortized cost of the product 
at december  future revenues from sale of products for which development costs remain on the balance sheet are anticipated to exceed the  of unamortized development costs 
impairment of long lived assets we regularly review the carrying value of capitalized software development costs and property and equipment 
we continually make estimates regarding future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
see the notes to our financial statements  which contain additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
recent accounting pronouncements sfas r  share based payment on december  the fasb issued sfas revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supercedes apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure of fair value recognition will no longer be an alternative 
sfas r is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after june   with earlier adoption permitted 
we are required to adopt this new standard in our fiscal year beginning january  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above but also permits restatement using amounts previously disclosed under the pro forma provisions of sfas either for a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we have not yet chosen a method of adoption for sfas r 
page 
table of contents as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method 
as a consequence  we generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
although the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have no adverse impact on our balance sheet or net cash flows  it will have a significant adverse impact on our net income and net income per share 
the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas to share based payments to employees in prior periods are disclosed in note under stock based incentive programs 
although the pro forma effects of applying sfas may be indicative of the effects of applying sfas r  the provisions of these two statements differ in some important respects 
the actual effects of adopting sfas r will depend on numerous factors including the valuation model we use to value future share based payments to employees  estimated forfeiture rates and the accounting policies we adopt concerning the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over the requisite service period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the rate of interest we will pay on our revolving credit facility with comerica bank 
interest rates on loans extended under that facility are at the bank s prime rate plus 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by from the market interest rates at december  would not have a material affect on our results of operations
