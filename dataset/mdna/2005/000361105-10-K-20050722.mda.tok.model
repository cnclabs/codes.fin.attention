item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands general overview we report our activities in four business segments aviation supply chain  maintenance  repair and overhaul  structures and systems  and aircraft sales and leasing 
sales in the aviation supply chain segment are derived from the sale of a wide variety of new  overhauled and repaired engine and airframe parts and components to the commercial aviation and defense markets  as well as the repair and overhaul of a wide range of commercial and military aircraft airframe parts 
sales also include the sales and lease of commercial jet engines 
cost of sales consists principally of the cost of product primarily aircraft and engine parts  direct labor and overhead primarily indirect labor  facility cost and insurance 
sales in the maintenance  repair and overhaul segment are derived from the repair and overhaul of most commercial landing gear types and aircraft maintenance and storage 
cost of sales consists principally of cost of product primarily replacement aircraft parts  direct labor and overhead 
sales in the structures and systems segment are derived from the manufacture and sale of a wide array of containers  pallets and shelters used to support the us military s tactical deployment requirements  in plane cargo loading and handling systems for commercial and military applications and advanced composite materials and components for aerospace and industrial use 
sales in this segment are also derived from the repair  overhaul and sale of parts for industrial gas and steam turbine operators and certain military engines 
cost of sales consists principally of the cost of product  direct labor and overhead 
sales in the aircraft sales and leasing segment are derived from the sale and lease of commercial aircraft and technical and advisory services 
cost of sales consists principally of cost of product aircraft  labor and the cost of lease revenue primarily depreciation  lease expense and insurance 
the table below sets forth consolidated sales for our four business segments for each of the last three fiscal years ended may for the year ended may  sales aviation supply chain maintenance  repair and overhaul structures and systems aircraft sales and leasing business environment and trends during fiscal and  the worldwide airline industry experienced an increase in air traffic as available seat miles  revenue passenger miles and load factors all improved 
this improvement in air traffic has been driven primarily by worldwide economic growth and is measured against the depressed levels in fiscal and  which were negatively affected by terrorism  war and disease outbreaks in asia 
although air traffic has improved and most air carriers have been successful in reducing their cost structures  many large us airlines continue to report substantial losses due to historically high fuel prices and a highly competitive pricing environment 
these losses  coupled with weak balance sheets  may cause further us airline restructurings  which may have a negative impact on future operating results 
lower cost carriers have been successful in gaining market share from the major us carriers and several of them are reporting profits 
low cost carriers generally have little to no infrastructure to support their maintenance requirements  which we believe will create additional opportunities for third party maintenance providers 
over the last three years  sales of our manufactured products and performance based logistics and supply chain management services to the us defense department and its contractors increased to  in fiscal  from  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in sales was driven by the us military s buildup and increased demand for supply chain management services 
although it remains difficult for us to predict the extent and duration of the military buildup and the impact on our operating results  we believe that we are well positioned with our current products and services and growth plans to benefit from longer term us military deployment and program management strategies 
factors which may affect future results our operating results and financial position may be adversely affected or fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of general economic conditions  geo political events  the commercial airline environment and other factors  including declining demand for our products and services and the ability of our customers to meet their financial obligations  relatively high fuel prices and its impact on our commercial customers financial position  declining market values for aviation products and equipment  difficulties in re leasing or selling aircraft and engines that are currently being leased  inability of our indianapolis airframe maintenance business to capture market share in the highly competitive airframe maintenance market  lack of assurance that sales to the us defense department  its agencies and its contractors which were of total sales in fiscal  will continue at levels previously experienced  including the mix of products sold  access to the debt and equity capital markets and the ability to draw down funds under financing agreements  non compliance with restrictive and financial covenants contained in certain of our loan agreements  changes in or non compliance with laws and regulations that may affect certain of our aviation related activities that are subject to licensing  certification and other regulatory requirements imposed by the faa and other regulatory agencies  both domestic and foreign  competition from other companies  including original equipment manufacturers  some of which have greater financial resources than us  exposure to product liability and property claims that may be in excess of our substantial liability insurance coverage  and the outcome of any pending or future material litigation or environmental proceedings 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated sales for fiscal were  which represents an increase of  or compared to fiscal in the aviation supply chain segment  fiscal sales increased  or compared to fiscal the sales increase reflects increased demand for engine and airframe parts support as a result of improved conditions in the worldwide commercial aviation industry as well as increased market penetration in europe and asia 
in the maintenance  repair and overhaul segment  sales increased  or compared to fiscal the sales increase is attributable to operations at our indianapolis airframe maintenance facility which commenced operations in january in the structures and systems segment  sales increased  or compared to fiscal we continue to experience strong sales to the us defense department for products supporting deployment activities and expect this strong performance to continue into future quarters  although not likely at the level experienced during fiscal we also experienced increased demand for cargo systems and composite structures primarily due to successful sales and marketing efforts 
in the aircraft sales and leasing segment  sales increased  or compared to fiscal the increase in sales was principally driven by the sale of our interest in certain aircraft for approximately  at essentially book value 
consolidated gross profit increased  or compared with the prior fiscal year 
the increase in gross profit is primarily attributable to the increase in sales and an increase in the gross profit margin to from in the prior year 
the gross profit margin percentage increased primarily due to a change in the mix of inventories sold within the aviation supply chain segment  partially offset by a pre tax charge recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the write down of an aircraft as a result of a renegotiated lease with an airline customer operating under bankruptcy protection 
operating income increased  or compared with the prior fiscal year due to the increase in gross profit  partially offset by an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
during fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or primarily due to increased resources to support our growth and a pension curtailment expense recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of a change to our cash balance pension plan 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses declined from to 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we retired  of notes payable due in december and  of convertible notes due in february the notes were repurchased for  and we charged of related capitalized financing costs  resulting in a net gain of during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the term of a non recourse note payable was extended to november  and the outstanding principal balance was reduced by the lender in the amount of  the reduction in the outstanding principal balance of  and the net gain on the early extinguishment of the and notes are reflected in gain on extinguishment of debt 
interest expense declined  or due to lower overall outstanding borrowings  partially offset by of additional interest expense recorded during the first quarter of fiscal associated with a litigation settlement 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a favorable federal income tax adjustment of  in october  the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law and included a number of federal income tax reforms  including an extension of the foreign tax credit carryforward period from five years to ten years 
in previous fiscal years  we had established a deferred tax valuation allowance of  against foreign tax credits expiring in fiscal year as a result of the new ten year carryforward period established by the act  we now expect to utilize the foreign tax credits and recorded a  credit to the provision for income taxes during the second quarter of fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  upon completion of our fiscal federal income tax return  we determined the company qualified for additional tax benefits of related to higher than estimated margin on fiscal export activities 
similarly  we recorded a benefit during the third quarter of last year which primarily related to additional tax benefits from fiscal export activities 
income from continuing operations was  for fiscal or an increase of  over the prior year due to the factors discussed above 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we sold our engine component repair business located in windsor  connecticut  and have classified its results as discontinued operations 
during the fiscal year ended may   the loss from discontinued operations was  or per diluted share and is comprised of the operating loss  net of tax  of and the loss on disposal  net of tax  of  net income was  for fiscal compared to  in the prior year 
fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated sales for fiscal were  which represents an increase of  or compared to fiscal in the aviation supply chain segment  fiscal sales decreased  or compared to fiscal at certain of our component repair facilities  demand for component repairs from our commercial airline customers had not recovered  and as a result we experienced lower sales compared to the prior year 
we also experienced lower sales of parts to general aviation customers as a result of our strategic decision to de emphasize certain lower margin products 
within this segment  sales increased to the us military and its contractors for spares and logistics support as well as to commercial customers for engine parts 
in the maintenance  repair and overhaul segment  fiscal sales increased  or compared with fiscal the increase in sales compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to higher sales at our aircraft maintenance facility due to an increase in the number of long term maintenance contracts with certain customers 
in the structures and systems segment  fiscal sales increased  or compared to fiscal the increase in sales compared to the prior year was due to record shipments of our manufactured products which support the us military deployment activities 
in the structures and systems segment  we experienced lower sales of our non aviation composite structure products as a result of the completion of a major contract in may in the aircraft sales and leasing segment  fiscal sales increased  or primarily as a result of increased demand for advisory services 
consolidated gross profit increased  or compared with the prior year 
the increase in our consolidated gross profit was primarily due to the increase in sales and an increase in our consolidated gross profit margin to from in the prior year 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we wrote off an investment in a joint venture and the associated  pre tax charge was recorded in cost of sales 
the gross margin percentage increased in the engine parts business within the aviation supply chain segment primarily due to the mix of inventories sold and in the structures and systems segment primarily due to increased volume at our facilities that manufacture products supporting the us military s tactical deployment activities 
fiscal gross profit included the  impairment charge recorded in may operating income increased  compared with the prior year primarily due to the increase in gross profit 
during fiscal  our selling  general  administrative and other expenses increased by  compared with fiscal primarily as a result of a provision for an unfavorable judgement in the amount of  a provision for a customer allowance of  and slightly higher personnel costs  partially offset by a gain recorded from the sale of a facility located in holtsville  new york 
interest expense decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to decreased average borrowings 
during the third quarter of fiscal  upon completion of our fiscal federal income tax return  we determined that we qualified for additional tax benefits of related primarily to higher than estimated margin on export activities 
this benefit was recorded in the third quarter 
in addition  our effective tax rate for fiscal reflects increased expected tax benefits related to current year export activities 
as a result of these items  we recorded a tax benefit of  for the fiscal year ended may  as a result of the factors discussed above  we reported net income of  for fiscal liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded our operating activities and met our commitments through the generation of cash from operations  augmented by the periodic issuance of common stock and debt in the public and private markets 
in addition to these cash sources  our capital resources include secured credit arrangements  which include an accounts receivable securitization program and a secured revolving credit facility 
our continuing ability to borrow from our lenders and issue debt and equity securities to the public and private markets in the future may be negatively affected by a number of factors  including general economic conditions  airline and aviation industry conditions  geo political events  including the war on terrorism  and our operating performance 
our ability to use our accounts receivable securitization program and revolving credit facility also may be negatively affected by these factors 
our ability to generate cash from operations is influenced primarily by our operating performance and working capital management 
we also have a universal shelf registration on file with the securities and exchange commission under which  subject to market conditions  up to  of common stock  preferred stock or medium or long term debt securities may be issued or sold 
at may   our liquidity and capital resources included cash of  and working capital of  as of may    of cash was restricted to support letters of credit 
at may   we had  available under our accounts receivable securitization program  no accounts receivable were securitized as of that date 
the amount available under this agreement is based on a formula of qualifying accounts receivable 
at may   we had  available under our secured revolving credit facility  no amounts were outstanding as of that date 
the amount available under the revolving credit facility is also based on a formula of qualifying assets as well as outstanding letters of credit 
as of may   unrestricted cash and amounts available to us under our secured credit arrangement and accounts receivable securitization program totaled  we continually evaluate various financing arrangements on commercially reasonable terms that would allow us to improve our liquidity position and finance future growth 
our ability to obtain additional financing is dependent upon a number of factors  including the geo political environment  general economic conditions  airline industry conditions  our operating performance and market conditions in the public and private debt and equity markets 
during the year ended may   we generated  of cash from operations primarily due to net income and depreciation and amortization of  a reduction in equipment on lease of  principally reflecting  received from the sale of our interest in certain aircraft  and an increase in accounts payable of  reflecting increased inventory levels and timing of cash disbursements  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of  reflecting increased sales during the fourth quarter as well as an increase to inventories of  reflecting investments made in support of new programs 
during the year ended may   our investing activities used  principally reflecting capital expenditures of  and investments made in aircraft joint ventures of  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of the engine component repair business of  we expect fiscal capital expenditures to be  to  principally reflecting increased investments in manufacturing capabilities to support recently awarded contracts and other growth initiatives 
we expect to make additional investments in joint ventures during fiscal during the year ended may   our financing activities used  of cash primarily due to a reduction in borrowings of  reflecting the early retirement of notes for  and other scheduled principal payments 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements a summary of contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of may  is as follows payments due by period due in due in due in due in due in after fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal total on balance sheet debt non recourse debt bank borrowings off balance sheet aviation equipment operating leases facilities and equipment operating leases garden city operating lease purchase obligations we routinely issue letters of credit and performance bonds in the ordinary course of business 
these instruments are typically issued in conjunction with insurance contracts or other business requirements 
the total of these instruments outstanding at may  was approximately  critical accounting policies and significant estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
management has made estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant estimates made by management include adjustments to reduce the value of inventories and equipment on or available for lease  allowance for doubtful accounts and loss accruals for aviation equipment operating leases 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the following is a summary of the accounting policies considered critical by management 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to reduce the value of customer accounts receivable to amounts expected to be collected 
in determining the required allowance  we consider factors such as general and industry specific economic conditions  customer credit history  and the customer s current and expected future financial performance 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the specific identification  average cost or first in  first out methods 
provisions are made for excess and obsolete inventories and inventories that have been impaired as a result of industry conditions 
we have utilized certain assumptions when determining the market value of inventories  such as historical sales of inventory  current and expected future aviation usage trends  replacement values and expected future demand 
principally as a result of the terrorist attacks of september  and its anticipated impact on the global airline industry s financial condition  fleet size and aircraft utilization  we recorded a significant charge for impaired inventories during the second quarter of fiscal utilizing those assumptions 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an additional charge as a result of a further decline in market value for these inventories 
reductions in demand for certain of our inventories or declining market values  as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the market value of our inventories  could result in additional impairment charges in future periods 
equipment on or available for lease lease revenue is recognized as earned 
the cost of the asset under lease is original purchase price plus overhaul costs 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated service life of the equipment  and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
the balance sheet classification is based on the lease term  with fixed term leases less than twelve months classified as short term and all others classified as long term 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we are required to test for impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
when applying the provisions of sfas no 
to equipment on or available for lease  we have utilized certain assumptions when estimating future undiscounted cash flows  including current and future lease rates  lease terms  residual values and market conditions and trends impacting future demand 
differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining undiscounted cash flows could result in future impairments of equipment on or available for lease 
aviation equipment operating leases from time to time we lease aviation equipment engines and aircraft from lessors under arrangements that are classified by us as operating leases 
we may also sublease the aviation equipment to a customer on a short or long term basis 
the terms of the operating leases in which we are the lessee are one year with options to renew annually at our election 
if we elect not to renew a lease or the lease term expires  we may purchase the equipment from the lessor at its scheduled purchase option price 
the terms of the lease agreements also allow us to purchase the equipment at any time during a lease at its scheduled purchase option price 
in those instances in which we anticipate that we will purchase aviation equipment and that the scheduled purchase option price will exceed estimated undiscounted cash flows related to the equipment  we record an accrual for loss 
we have utilized certain assumptions when estimating future undiscounted cash flows  such as current and future lease rates  residual values and market conditions and trends impacting future demand 
differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining undiscounted cash flows could result in future provisions for losses on aviation equipment under operating leases 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain statements relating to future results  which are forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are based on the beliefs of management  as well as assumptions and estimates based on information available to us as of the dates such assumptions and estimates are made  and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated  depending on a variety of factors  including those factors discussed under this item entitled factors which may affect future results 
should one or more of those risks or uncertainties materialize adversely  or should underlying assumptions or estimates prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those described 
those events and uncertainties are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many are beyond our control 
we assume no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions that may be made to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands our exposure to market risk includes fluctuating interest rates under our credit agreements  foreign exchange rates and accounts receivable 
see part ii  item for a discussion on accounts receivable exposure 
during fiscal and  we did not utilize derivative financial instruments to offset these risks 
at may    was available under our secured revolving credit facility with merrill lynch capital 
interest on amounts borrowed under this credit facility is libor based 
as of may   the outstanding balance under this agreement was a hypothetical percent increase to the average interest rate under the credit facilities applied to the average outstanding balance during fiscal would have reduced our pre tax income by approximately during fiscal revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates during the period  and balance sheet accounts are translated at period end exchange rates 
balance sheet translation adjustments are excluded from the results of operations and are recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
a hypothetical percent devaluation of foreign currencies against the us dollar would not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations
