unless otherwise noted  all dollar amounts are in millions and those relating to our results of operations are presented before taxes 
we are one of the foremost providers of travel and real estate services in the world 
our businesses provide consumer and business services primarily in the travel and real estate services industries  which are intended to complement one another and create cross marketing opportunities both within and among each of our core business units 
as of december   our segment structure comprised the following six business segments 
l real estate franchise and operations franchises the real estate brokerage businesses of our four residential and one commercial brands  provides real estate brokerage services and facilitates employee relocations  l mortgage services provides home buyers with title and closing services and  as of december   provided home buyers with mortgage lending and appraisal services  l hospitality services develops and sells vacation ownership interests  provides consumer financing to individuals purchasing these interests  facilitates the exchange of vacation ownership interests  franchises eight lodging brands and markets vacation rental properties  l travel distribution services provides global distribution services for the travel industry  corporate and consumer online travel services and travel agency services  l vehicle services operates and franchises our vehicle rental brands and  as of december   provided commercial fleet management services and fuel card services  l marketing services formerly  financial services provides insurance  membership  loyalty and enhancement products and services to financial institutions and other partners and their customers 
our management team is committed to building long term value through operational excellence and we are steadfast in our commitment to deploy our cash to increase stockholder value 
to this end  in late  we initiated a corporate debt reduction program with the goal of decreasing our outstanding corporate indebtedness by billion 
we accomplished this goal in late and ended the year with approximately billion of outstanding corporate indebtedness  a decrease of approximately billion since december  during this process  we also eliminated all of our convertible debt securities and greatly simplified our corporate debt structure  which now principally consists of six tranches of straight debt due over the next eleven years and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we also committed to an aggressive share repurchase plan and to our first ever regular common stock dividend program 
we used approximately billion of cash  net of proceeds from option exercises  to repurchase our common stock during and and plan to continue this program  within the constraints of our capitalization targets  for the foreseeable future 
for each of the first and second quarters of  we paid quarterly cash dividends of cents per share and for the third and fourth quarters  we paid a quarterly cash dividend of cents per share 
we also plan to pay a quarterly cash dividend of cents per share on march  while no assurances can be given  we expect to periodically increase our dividend at a rate at least equal to our earnings growth 
in early  we began to execute our plan to simplify our business model by exiting non core businesses or businesses that produce volatility to our earnings inconsistent with our business model and the remainder of our portfolio 
in june  we successfully completed the initial public offering of jackson hewitt tax service inc  raising approximately million of cash including a special dividend of million  and on january   we completed the spin off of our mortgage  fleet leasing and appraisal businesses in a tax free distribution of phh common stock to our shareholders 
additionally  on february   we completed the initial public offering of our wright express fuel card subsidiary for approximately billion 
we received approximately million of proceeds in connection with the offering and a special dividend of approximately million 
we also expect to divest our marketing services segment no later than third quarter 
table of contents the proceeds of these divestitures will be or have already been reinvested to acquire strategic assets in our core travel and real estate verticals and to repurchase additional common stock 
we continue to seek similar opportunities to augment our travel and real estate portfolios and further shift the mix of our businesses toward the areas in which we believe our greatest strategic advantages lie  as demonstrated by our recent acquisition of ebookers plc and our pending acquisition of gullivers travel associates see note to our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations vs 
our consolidated results from continuing operations are summarized as follows change net revenues total expenses income before income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes minority interest  net of tax income from continuing operations does not include results of jackson hewitt  which is presented as a discontinued operation 
net revenues increased approximately billion in as compared with due principally to growth in our core residential real estate and travel businesses  which also contributed to the increase in total expenses to support the increased volume of underlying transactions 
in addition  the consolidation of trl group on july  contributed to the year over year increase in both revenues and expenses  as their results are included in all twelve months of but only in six months during post consolidation on july  and forward 
the acquisitions of several strategic businesses  primarily within the real estate and travel verticals in which are discussed in greater detail below  also contributed to the increases in revenues and expenses  as their results are included from their respective acquisition dates forward 
these increases were partially offset by an expected decline in both revenues generated and expenses incurred by our mortgage business  as expected  due to reduced mortgage refinancing activity experienced industry wide 
additionally offsetting the above mentioned increases in expenses was a reduction of million in interest expense during  which principally reflected a decrease in losses incurred in connection with our early extinguishments of debt and an overall reduction in our outstanding debt  as well as million of interest received in connection with a federal tax refund 
in addition  we recorded a net credit of million during in connection with the resolution of certain legal matters relating to the discovery of accounting irregularities in the former business units of cuc international  inc  whereas we incurred million of expense during such change principally reflects million of previously established liabilities relating to severance and other termination benefits for which we no longer believe we are liable  partially offset by additional costs related to the ongoing investigations into the cuc accounting irregularities 
our overall effective tax rate was and for and  respectively 
the difference in the effective tax rates is primarily due to a reduction to our tax contingency reserve primarily resulting from audit settlements in and taxes on the redemption of our mandatorily redeemable preferred interest in as a result of the above mentioned items  income from continuing operations increased million 

table of contents discussed below are the results of operations for each of our reportable segments 
management evaluates the operating results of each of our reportable segments based upon revenue and ebitda  which is defined as income from continuing operations before non program related depreciation and amortization  non program related interest  amortization of pendings and listings  income taxes and minority interest

a includes the results of operations of non strategic businesses  unallocated corporate overhead and the elimination of transactions between segments 
real estate franchise and operations revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared with  reflecting growth across all of our real estate businesses 
nrt incorporated  our real estate brokerage subsidiary  made acquisitions of various real estate brokerage businesses during and for which the operating results have been included from their acquisition dates forward 
nrt s significant acquisitions  including sotheby s international realty  contributed million and million of incremental revenues and ebitda  respectively  to the operating results for excluding the impact of these significant acquisitions  nrt generated incremental revenues of million in  a increase over this increase was substantially comprised of higher commission income earned on homesale transactions  which was substantially driven by a increase in the average price of homes sold 
nrt has a significant concentration of real estate brokerage offices and transactions in geographic regions where home prices are at the higher end of the real estate market  including northern and southern california 
the year over year increase in average price was driven by an overall industry wide increase in the market prices of homes and stronger volume of higher priced homesales in compared with we expect the upward trend in the market values of homesale prices that we have benefited from in previous quarters to moderate in future quarters 
commission expenses paid to real estate agents increased million as a result of the incremental revenues earned on homesale transactions as well as a higher average commission rate paid to real estate agents in due to variances in the geographic mix of homesales and the progressive nature of agent commission schedules 
our real estate franchise business generated million of royalties and marketing fund revenues during as compared with million during  an increase of million 
such growth was primarily driven by a increase in the average price of homes sold and an increase in the number of homesale transactions  partially offset by an increase in volume incentives paid to our largest independent brokers 
royalty increases in our real estate franchise business are recognized with little or no corresponding increase in expenses due to the 
table of contents significant operating leverage within the franchise operations 
in addition to royalties received from our third party franchise affiliates  nrt  our wholly owned real estate brokerage firm  continues to pay royalties to our real estate franchise business 
however  these intercompany royalties  which approximated million and million for and  respectively  are eliminated in consolidation and therefore have no impact on this segment s revenues or ebitda 
the real estate franchise business has affiliate offices that are more widely dispersed across the united states and are not as concentrated in certain geographic areas as our nrt brokerage operations 
accordingly  operating results and homesale statistics driving operations may differ between nrt and the real estate franchise business based upon geographic presence and the corresponding homesale activity in each geographic region 
our strategy for continued growth in this business includes the international expansion and aggressive marketing of our sotheby s international realty brand 
revenues from our relocation services business increased million principally resulting from higher referral fees  which were driven by an increased volume of relocation referrals and a higher average fee per referral as home values have increased year over year 
marketing  operating and administrative expenses apart from the nrt acquisitions and real estate agent commission expenses  both of which are discussed separately above increased approximately million  principally reflecting an increase in variable expenses associated with higher nrt homesale revenue and growth in our relocation services business  as discussed above 
mortgage services revenues and ebitda decreased million and million  respectively  in compared with primarily due to the expected decline in refinancing activity experienced industry wide  partially offset by increased revenues from mortgage servicing activities 
mortgage refinancing closings were approximately billion lower in than in refinancing activity is sensitive to interest rate changes relative to borrowers current interest rates and typically increases when interest rates fall and decreases when interest rates rise 
the year ended december  was marked by historically high refinancing activity  which decreased the propensity for borrowers to refinance during this factor along with increased competitive pricing pressures due to lower industry volumes caused revenue from mortgage loan production to decrease 
typically  as refinancing activity declines  borrower prepayments also decline  which generally results in an increase in the value of the mortgage servicing rights msr asset  all other factors being equal 
our production revenue in any given year is driven by a mix of mortgage loans closed and mortgage loans sold 
the following chart presents our production revenues from originated mortgage loans held for sale which are generated at the time of sale and fee based mortgage originations where we perform outsourced mortgage origination functions for a fee which are generated at the time of closing change change loan closings and loan sales in billions loans closed to be securitized fee based loan closings total closings loan sales production revenue in millions production revenue from loan sales fee based production revenue total production revenue partially offsetting the decrease in production revenue was an increase of million in net revenues generated from servicing mortgage loans 
this increase reflects i a million net reduction in amortization expense and provision for impairment related to our msr asset  net of derivative results  which is primarily attributable to lower prepayment rates experienced in compared with driven by the decrease in refinancing activity in 
table of contents  ii a million increase in gross recurring servicing fees fees received for servicing existing loans in the portfolio driven by a increase in the average servicing portfolio  which rose to approximately billion in and iii a million increase in other servicing revenue 
revenues within our appraisal business declined million in compared with due to lower volumes  consistent with the expected decline in mortgage refinancing volume 
revenues within our other settlement services business declined million  which principally reflects a million decline due to lower volumes also consistent with the expected decline in mortgage refinancing volume  partially offset by a million gain recorded on the sale of certain non core assets in first quarter operating expenses within this segment declined approximately million in primarily due to the decline in refinancing activity discussed above 
as previously discussed  we completed the spin off of our mortgage  fleet leasing and appraisal operations on january  in a tax free distribution of one share of phh common stock per every twenty shares of cendant common stock held on january  we have entered into a mortgage origination venture with phh to continue to participate in the earnings generated from originating mortgages for customers of our real estate brokerage and relocation businesses 
phh will manage this venture  which is expected to commence operations in mid we expect to record a non cash impairment charge in first quarter to reflect any difference between the carrying values and market values of these businesses 
we currently anticipate that such non cash charge will be in the range of million to million 
approximately one third of this charge will be allocated to continuing operations and approximately two thirds to discontinued operations  reflecting the relative values of the mortgage and fleet businesses  respectively  and the fact that the mortgage business will not be presented as discontinued operations 
we do not anticipate recording a tax benefit associated with this charge 
hospitality services revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared with net sales of vacation ownership interests vois in our timeshare resorts increased million in  an increase over despite the hurricanes that hit north america and the caribbean during the third quarter of  which negatively impacted voi sales in our southeastern properties in the second half of the net increase in voi sales in our timeshare resorts was primarily driven by an increase in the average price per voi sales transaction as well as a million increase in upgrade sales at our trendwest resort properties  partially offset by a reduction in tour flow and a million reduction in the recognition of voi deferred revenues related to resort properties under construction 
revenues and certain related costs recognized on voi sales at resort properties under construction are done so using the percentage of completion method of accounting and accordingly  are deferred and recognized in future periods as the resort properties are completed 
the number of tours in was negatively impacted by do not call legislation  which became effective in october and reduced telemarketers ability to call consumers at home unless a preexisting relationship existed 
we continue to take actions to mitigate the unfavorable impact on tour flow from the legislation by introducing new sales initiatives designed to improve sales efficiencies 
during  we sold certain of our timeshare resort properties and recognized gains on sale of million 
additionally  incremental resort management fees of million were generated through increased rental revenues on unoccupied units as well as growth in the number of units under management during revenue also increased million  while ebitda declined million in  primarily as a result of consolidating our largest timeshare receivable securitization structures during third quarter and year over year growth in our contract receivables portfolio 
the consolidation of the securitization structures resulted in the recognition of interest revenues on contract receivables and interest expense incurred on the debt funding of such contracts instead of applying gain on sale accounting to such securitizations  prior to consolidation 
accordingly  as a result of the consolidation  as well as the year over year growth in the contract receivables portfolio  interest revenue generated in exceeded the interest revenue recognized and the gain on sale accounting applied to securitizations in ebitda  however  was negatively impacted by the absence of gain on sale accounting in  partially offset by the net interest income recognized in in connection with the consolidation and subsequent growth of the contract receivable portfolio 
exchange and subscription fee revenues within our timeshare exchange business increased million during despite the hurricanes that hit north america and the caribbean during the third quarter of  the 
table of contents effects of which were felt throughout the remainder of the year 
such growth was primarily driven by i a increase in the average number of worldwide subscribers  ii a increase in the average subscription price per member and iii a increase in the average exchange fee  partially offset by a reduction in exchange transaction volume 
timeshare points and rental transaction revenue rentals of unused timeshare inventory grew million driven principally by an increase in points and rental transaction volume and a increase in the average price per rental transaction 
revenue trends reflect the expected shift in the rci timeshare membership base toward a greater mix of points members from traditional one week timeshare members 
points transactions are those executed by points members for other than a standard  one week stay at an rci timeshare property 
rental transactions are rentals of unused timeshare inventory to rci members and non members 
in addition  our timeshare exchange business generated incremental revenue of million due to an increase in travel related services provided to customers of our international membership business 
royalties and marketing and reservation fund revenues within our lodging franchise operations increased million in primarily due to a increase in revenue per available room and a basis point increase in the net effective royalty rate  partially offset by a reduction in room count 
these changes reflect quality control initiatives implemented in whereby we terminated from our franchise system certain properties that were not meeting required standards and tightened requirements for properties not meeting their financial obligations to us 
we continue to focus on quality and required standards  however we expect property terminations to moderate in additionally  in fourth quarter we launched triprewards  a loyalty program that enables customers to earn rewards when staying at cendant s lodging brand hotels or when purchasing services or products from program partners 
the triprewards program enables us to earn fees on revenues generated by our franchisees from triprewards members 
the program contributed million of incremental revenue during  which was substantially utilized for marketing expenditures to promote our lodging brands  to fund the cost of rewards earned by customers and to administrate the program 
in may  we completed the acquisition of landal greenparks  a dutch vacation rental company specializing in the rental of privately owned vacation homes located on european holiday parks 
during  landal contributed million to revenues and million to ebitda 
in october  we completed the acquisition of canvas holidays limited  a tour operator based in scotland  providing camping holidays located on campsites throughout europe principally in france to british and northern european consumers 
during  canvas holidays contributed million to revenues and million to ebitda 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more detail regarding these acquisitions 
apart from the landal and canvas holidays acquisitions  revenues at our european vacation rental companies increased million in substantially due to a favorable impact on revenues from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  which were substantially offset in ebitda by the unfavorable impact of exchange rate movements on expenses 
operating  marketing and administrative expenses within the hospitality segment  excluding expenses generated by landal and canvas holidays and other expense variances discussed separately above  increased approximately million in principally reflecting higher variable costs incurred to support increased revenues and increased costs associated with prior period acquisitions in our vacation rental business  partially offset by favorable cost of sales and commissions as a percentage of related voi revenues in our timeshare business and favorable bad debt expense period over period related to the settlement of a lodging franchisee receivable during that had been previously reserved for during travel distribution services revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared with  which includes the operating results of orbitz  which was acquired in november the operating results of orbitz were included from the acquisition date forward and contributed revenues of million and an ebitda loss of million to results 
the ebitda loss incurred by orbitz is partly reflective of integration costs incurred to combine the technology platforms and operations of our orbitz  cheaptickets and travelport businesses to form one common platform and expand our travel distribution capabilities 
we intend to maintain and promote the orbitz  cheaptickets  and travelport businesses as differentiated travel brands in the leisure and corporate travel sectors  while integrating the technology and infrastructure of each  which we believe will provide a significant opportunity to increase profitability 
we expect to start producing cost saving synergies as a result of such integration activities in with the most significant savings to be recognized beginning in the 
table of contents second half of in addition  five other subsidiaries specializing in online travel and travel packaging and consolidation  which were acquired in and  impacted the year over year comparison as their operating results were included from their acquisition dates forward 
such acquisitions collectively contributed incremental revenue and ebitda of million and million  respectively  to the results 
based on the aforementioned acquisition of orbitz combined with our existing travel businesses and also factoring in i the february acquisition of ebookers  an online european travel service provider  and ii the pending acquisition of gullivers travel associates  a wholesaler of hotels  destination services  travel packages and group tours and online provider of lodging and destination services  expected to close in april   we believe that we have strengthened our position as a global travel intermediary 
our strategic focus has been to further penetrate corporate and consumer online channels which we are accomplishing through strategic acquisitions and shifting some of our existing offline travel agency bookings to the on line channel 
we have expanded our operations within the travel industry such that in addition to our role as an order taker  or transaction processor  primarily serving offline travel agencies via their use of the company s electronic global distribution system gds services  we have also assumed a role as an order maker  or transaction generator  which is based on direct customer relationships 
galileo  our subsidiary that provides gds services to the travel industry  generated million of incremental worldwide air booking fees in as international air booking fees increased million  while domestic air booking fees decreased million 
the increase in international air booking fees was driven by a increase in the effective yield on such bookings and a increase in booking volumes  which rose to million segments for the yield increase partially resulted from a greater number of premium booking transactions that allow customers additional itinerary options 
international booking volume in was suppressed by reduced travel in europe during the second half of  which was due in part to labor uncertainties surrounding an air carrier in italy with whom our galileo subsidiary conducts business  which was resolved in late international air bookings represented approximately two thirds of our total air bookings during and the reduction in domestic air booking fees was driven by a decline in the effective yield partially offset by a increase in booking volumes  which reached million segments in the effective yield decline and increase in volume on domestic air bookings is consistent with our pricing program with major us carriers in order to gain access to all public fares made available by the participating airlines 
additionally  revenues and ebitda include a million reduction in subscriber fees resulting from fewer travel agencies leasing computer equipment from us during compared with and a million decrease in information services revenue  which are primarily sales of competitive airline fare information 
commensurate with our strategic focus to further penetrate online channels in the travel industry  including shifting some of our offline travel agency bookings to the online channel  online net revenues grew million organically excluding the impact of acquisitions in compared with driven by a increase in online gross bookings substantially within our cheaptickets 
com website while our offline travel agency net revenues decreased million 
the growth in online gross bookings was attributable to improved site functionality leading to increased conversion  enhanced content  which included additional hotel offerings in the online market  and more visitors resulting from increased marketing efforts 
excluding the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions  expenses within this segment increased approximately million in expense increases year over year included i million of higher commission expenses  primarily due to a greater number and mix of bookings during in countries with higher commission rates  ii million of increased market incentive costs  used in promoting our services to travel agencies  iii million of expense related to airline fare guarantees and iv million of increased bad debt expense  the majority of which was related to receivables from airlines in bankruptcy 
this was partially offset by cost savings from expense reductions  including network communication and maintenance and installation expense savings due  in part  to reduced subscriber volume 
in addition  there was a net reduction in salary and benefit related expenses in due in part  to the favorable impact in from benefit plan amendments that occurred in and cost benefits realized in from shifting our offline travel agency operations to online channels  which included the closure of certain call centers 

table of contents vehicle services revenue and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared with revenue generated by our cendant car rental group comprised of avis car rental and budget car and truck rental operations increased million avis car rental revenues increased million in which was comprised of a million increase in car rental time and mileage t m revenue and a million increase in ancillary revenues 
the revenue change is inclusive of favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations internationally which positively impacted revenue by million  but was principally offset in ebitda by the effect of such exchange rate movements on expenses 
the increase in t m revenues was principally driven by a increase in the number of days an avis vehicle was rented 
the increase in ancillary revenues was due in part to higher gasoline revenues  which resulted from increased gas prices in compared with the impact of the increase in gasoline prices on revenues was more than offset in ebitda by a lower profit margin on gas in compared with budget car rental revenues declined million in  which was comprised of a million increase in car rental t m revenue and a million reduction in other ancillary revenues 
the increase in t m revenue was driven by a increase in car rental days  which was partially offset by a reduction in t m revenue per day 
this reflects  in part  the resulting impact of our strategic decision to reposition the budget car rental brand by reducing the cost structure and pricing to be more competitive with other leisure focused car rental brands 
we have also made efforts to enhance the profitability of the budget brand by reducing higher risk rentals to drivers under years of age and enhanced verification of drivers licenses 
the decline in ancillary revenues was principally comprised of lower surcharge fees from youthful renters and reductions in revenues generated from counter sales of insurance  which were substantially offset in ebitda by a corresponding reduction in incentives paid to counter representatives 
pricing at both our avis and budget car rental brands during was negatively impacted by competitive conditions in the car rental industry as a result of higher industry wide fleet levels  which we believe was caused by enhanced incentives offered by car manufacturers 
however  such manufacturer incentives also resulted in lower fleet costs  which significantly offset the ebitda impact of lower pricing 
the revenue changes for budget are inclusive of favorable foreign currency exchange rates aggregating million  which was principally offset in ebitda by the opposite impact of foreign currency exchange rates on expenses 
budget truck rental revenues increased million in comprised of a million increase in t m revenue and a million reduction in other ancillary revenues 
the additional budget truck rental t m revenue reflects a reduction in rental days offset by a increase in t m per day 
during  we reduced the average budget truck fleet by compared with the average fleet size in  which reflects our efforts to focus on higher utilization of newer and more efficient trucks 
wright express  our fuel card subsidiary  recognized incremental revenues of million in compared with this growth was driven by a combination of new customers  increased usage of the fuel card product and higher fuel prices 
as previously discussed  we completed the initial public offering of wright express on february  in february  we completed the acquisition of first fleet corporation  a national provider of fleet management services to companies that maintain private truck fleets 
the operating results of first fleet were included from the acquisition date forward and contributed revenues and ebitda of million and million  respectively  to results 
apart from this acquisition  revenue from our fleet leasing operations increased million primarily due to an increase in vehicle depreciation expense  which is billed to clients and therefore has no impact on ebitda 
in addition  revenue and ebitda were favorably impacted by million as a result of additional fees and commissions earned on vehicle maintenance service contracts 
as previously discussed  we completed the spin off of our mortgage  fleet leasing and appraisal operations on january  in a tax free distribution of phh common stock and expect to record a non cash impairment charge ranging 
table of contents between million and million in first quarter to reflect any difference between the carrying values and market values of these businesses 
excluding the acquisition of first fleet  total expenses within this segment decreased approximately million on a revenue increase of million 
the favorable profit margin primarily resulted from continued operating efficiencies realized in connection with the successful integration of budget  increased internet reservation activity resulting in reduced call volume and associated costs and commissions and favorable insurance costs as a result of the reduction in higher risk budget car rentals  as discussed above 
marketing services revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared with effective july   we consolidated trl group pursuant to the provisions of fin therefore  in  revenues and ebitda for reflect the results of trl group for twelve months  whereas revenues and ebitda for reflect the results of trl group for six months 
in  trl group after eliminations of intercompany revenues and expenses contributed incremental revenues and ebitda of million and million  respectively  for the period january  through june  apart from the consolidation of trl group  revenues for the marketing services segment increased million while ebitda decreased million in compared with revenue generated by our individual membership business decreased million primarily due to the expected decline in the membership base retained by us in connection with the original outsourcing of our individual membership business members acquired prior to july to trl group in july and the decline in the trl group membership base members acquired from marketing campaigns between july and january as a result of the january amendment to our contractual relationship with trl group  inc see note to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion regarding this transaction 
the declines in both run off membership bases resulted in a year over year revenue reduction of million 
this reduction was partially offset by million of new membership revenue as a result of our marketing to attract new members subsequent to the january amendment whereby we began marketing to new members under the trilegiant tradename 
as a result of the january amendment  our membership base will continue to grow as we realize the benefits from our marketing efforts to solicit new members  while trl group s membership base will continue to shrink as they no longer have the ability to solicit new members 
the revenue generated from our increasing membership base generally is not recognized until after the member trial period has expired and then is recognized ratably over the life of the membership 
as a result  during  we recognized million of ebitda losses resulting from marketing expenses incurred to solicit new members beginning in january for which we expect to realize revenues in future periods 
further  we experienced an unfavorable impact on ebitda of million resulting from reduced revenues for the membership base retained by us in connection with the original outsourcing of our individual membership business to trl group in july that was partially mitigated by a net reduction in expenses from servicing fewer members 
in addition  as a result of no longer incurring marketing expenses to solicit new members as of january   trl group ebitda increased million during the second half of as compared to the same period in revenues in our insurance and loyalty operations include million of favorable foreign currency exchange movements  which benefited ebitda million  after including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on expenses 
ebitda in our insurance and loyalty operations was negatively impacted by million related to a verdict rendered in connection with a contractual dispute with a third party insurance partner 
ebitda in also includes million of additional amortization of deferred costs in ebitda benefited million in from cost reductions and restructuring activities undertaken by our international operations in revenue and ebitda also benefited by million of gains recognized in connection with the termination of two contractual relationships with third party marketing partners 
in third quarter  we received million in connection with the early termination of a contractual relationship with a third party marketing partner that was originally expected to extend beyond trl group had provided services for this marketing partner in in exchange for royalties related to the success of the marketing program 
trl group and the marketing partner 
table of contents disputed certain aspects of the marketing agreement and a settlement was reached in september that provided for early termination of the agreement 
however  the favorable impact of the early termination was partially offset by the absence of royalties generated under this contractual relationship of million in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period in we also recognized million in in connection with the early termination of a contractual relationship with a third party marketing partner whereby we marketed card protection services to the marketing partner s customers and paid commissions to the marketing partner based on the membership fees that we collected 
revenue and ebitda for also includes a million gain on the sale of commission rights related to our long term care insurance business 
in june  we discontinued the marketing and sale of long term preferred care insurance policies  however  we continued to derive commission revenues pursuant to agreements with the insurance carriers that issued the policies we previously sold 
in fourth quarter  we recognized a million gain in connection with the sale of the majority of the commission rights associated with the policies we sold prior to june corporate and other revenues increased million and the ebitda loss decreased from million in to million in revenues and ebitda were favorably impacted in by million of additional realized gains on the sale of homestore stock  partially offset by a million gain recognized in on the sale of our equity investment in entertainment publications  inc revenue and ebitda also reflect million and million  respectively  of incremental earnings on a credit card marketing program under which we earn fees based on a percentage of credit card spending 
partially offsetting this revenue increase is million of incremental intersegment revenue eliminations in due to increased intercompany business activities 
ebitda was also favorably impacted year over year by i a million reduction in securities related litigation charges in compared with principally resulting from a credit of million in relating to previously established liabilities for severance and other termination benefits for which we no longer believe we are liable  partially offset by ongoing investigation costs relating to the discovery in of accounting irregularities in former cuc businesses and ii a credit of million in relating to the termination of a lease on more favorable terms than originally estimated 
these favorable ebitda variances were partially offset by a million increase in incentive based compensation expenses 
results of operations vs 
our consolidated results from continuing operations are summarized as follows change net revenues total expenses income before income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes minority interest  net of tax income from continuing operations does not include results of jackson hewitt  which is presented as a discontinued operation 

table of contents net revenues and total expenses increased approximately billion and approximately billion  respectively  during principally due to the acquisitions of the following businesses  which contributed revenues and expenses including depreciation and amortization expense for the period january  through the anniversary date of the acquisition the pre anniversary period as follows pre anniversary net pre anniversary acquired business date of acquisition revenues total expenses nrt incorporated a april   trendwest resorts  inc b april net assets of budget group  inc c november   total contributions a represents nrt including the settlement services business of nrt and nrt s significant brokerage acquisitions subsequent to our ownership

the above table reflects the net revenues and total expenses of the nrt  trendwest and budget businesses from january  to the anniversary date of our acquisitions thereof and  for nrt and trendwest  are not indicative of the full year operating results contributed by these businesses 
the amounts for nrt reflect the seasonality of the real estate brokerage business whereby the operating results are typically weakest in the early part of the calendar year and strengthen in the second and third quarters which are not reflected in the above amounts  as nrt was acquired on april  
the amounts for budget include acquisition and integration related costs  which were substantially incurred in the first year following the acquisition date  however  the benefits resulting from such costs are not realized until future periods 
the integration of budget represents a significant growth opportunity in future periods and is proceeding according to plan 
in addition to the contributions made by the aforementioned acquired businesses  revenues and expenses also increased during from i organic growth in our real estate services businesses  especially our real estate brokerage and mortgage businesses even after adjusting for the million non cash provision for impairment of our mortgage servicing rights asset  which we recorded in and discuss in greater detail below under mortgage services and ii the consolidation of trl group  which contributed incremental revenues and expenses after elimination entries of million and million  respectively 
the growth in our mortgage and real estate brokerage businesses also contributed to the increase in total expenses  as we incurred additional expenses to support the continued high level of mortgage loan production  related servicing activities and home sale transactions 
the increases in total expenses were partially offset by a reduction of million in acquisition and integration related costs primarily due to the amortization in of the pendings and listings intangible asset acquired as part of the acquisition of nrt  which was amortized over the closing period of the underlying contracts approximately five months 
in addition  total expenses benefited by a million reduction in litigation and related charges 
our overall effective tax rate decreased to for from for primarily due to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards and lower taxes on foreign earnings  partially offset by an increase in state taxes  taxes on the redemption of our million mandatorily redeemable preferred interest and other non deductible items

real estate franchise and operations revenues and ebitda increased approximately billion and million  respectively  in compared with  reflecting growth across all of our real estate businesses 
we acquired nrt inclusive of its settlement services business  which is now included in our settlement services business within the mortgage services segment on april  and  in addition  nrt acquired real estate brokerage businesses subsequent to our ownership 
the operating results of nrt and its significant acquisitions were included from their acquisition dates forward and  therefore  contributed approximately billion of revenues and an ebitda decline of million during the pre anniversary period in does not include the operating results of nrt s settlement services business  which is reported within the mortgage services segment 
the ebitda decline is reflective of the seasonality of the real estate brokerage business  whereby the operating results are typically weakest in the early part of the calendar year and strengthen in the second and third quarters 
excluding the impact of nrt s brokerage acquisitions  nrt generated incremental net revenues of million  a increase in the comparable post acquisition periods in versus the increase in nrt s revenues was substantially comprised of incremental commission income on home sale transactions  primarily due to a increase in the average price of homes sold 
real estate agent commission expenses also increased million as a result of the incremental revenues earned on home sale transactions 
our real estate franchise business generated million of royalty and marketing fund revenues during as compared with million in the amount includes million of revenues received from nrt  our wholly owned real estate brokerage firm  prior to our acquisition on april   at which time nrt was our largest franchisee 
excluding the impact of the acquisition  royalty and marketing fund revenues increased million  which was principally driven by a increase in volume of home sale transactions and a increase in the average price of homes sold 
nrt continues to pay royalties to our real estate franchise 
table of contents business 
however  these intercompany royalties for the period april  through december  and for the entire fiscal year ended december   which approximated million and million  respectively  are eliminated in consolidation and therefore have no impact on this segment s revenues or ebitda 
revenue within this segment also benefited by a change during in the presentation of a revenue stream generated by our relocation business to conform to the presentation used by similar larger scale businesses within our mortgage services segment 
such change resulted in an increase of million in revenues 
there was no impact to ebitda from this change in presentation 
prior to our acquisition of nrt in  nrt paid our real estate franchise business million in real estate referral fees and a million termination fee related to a franchise agreement under which nrt operated brokerage offices under our era real estate brand 
we also had a preferred stock investment in nrt that generated dividend income of million in before we acquired nrt 
excluding the impact from our acquisition of nrt  nrt s significant acquisitions and nrt s real estate agent commission expenses discussed above  operating and administrative expenses within this segment increased approximately million compared to primarily due to increased home sale transactions 
mortgage services revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared with principally due to a significant increase in mortgage loan production  which was partially offset by an increase in amortization of the msr asset as comparatively lower interest rates during resulted in record levels of mortgage refinancing activity 
revenues from mortgage loan production increased million in compared with the prior year and were derived from growth in our fee based mortgage origination operations and a increase in the volume of loans that we sold 
we sold approximately billion of mortgage loans in compared with approximately billion in  generating incremental production revenues of million 
in addition  production revenues generated from our fee based mortgage origination activity increased million as compared with total mortgage loans closed increased approximately billion to approximately billion in  comprised of a billion increase in closed loans to be securitized and a billion increase in closed loans that were fee based 
refinancings increased approximately billion to approximately billion and purchase mortgage closings grew approximately billion to approximately billion 
net revenues from servicing mortgage loans increased million primarily due to the absence in of a million non cash provision for impairment of our msr asset recorded in declines in interest rates at such time resulted in increases to our current and estimated future loan prepayment rates and a corresponding provision for impairment against the value of our msr asset 
apart from this impairment charge  net servicing revenues declined million primarily due to a period over period increase in msr amortization and provision for impairment recorded net within revenues of million  partially offset by million of incremental gains from hedging and other derivative activities 
the increase in msr amortization and provision for impairment is a result of the high levels of refinancings and related mortgage loan prepayments that occurred in due to low mortgage interest rates during the incremental gains from hedging and other derivative activities resulted from our strategies to protect earnings in the event that there was a decline in the value of our msr asset  which can be caused by  among other factors  reductions in interest rates  as such reductions tend to increase borrower prepayment activity 
in addition  recurring servicing fees increased million driven by a period over period increase in the average servicing portfolio  which rose to billion in interest rates had risen from their lows in the earlier part of and  as a result  in fourth quarter mortgage refinancing volume and resulting net production revenues comparatively declined 
this decline in mortgage production revenues had been partially offset by an increase in revenues from mortgage servicing activities 
historically  mortgage production and mortgage servicing operations have been counter cyclical in nature and represented a naturally offsetting relationship 
additionally  to supplement this relationship  we have maintained a 
table of contents comprehensive  non speculative mortgage risk management program to further mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on our operating results 
revenues also benefited from our acquisition of nrt s settlement services business on april  the operating results of nrt s settlement services business were included from the acquisition date forward and  therefore  contributed million of revenues and million of ebitda during the pre anniversary period 
additionally  during  we merged our pre existing settlement services businesses with and into the larger scale settlement services business of nrt both of which are included in this segment 
upon combining such businesses  we changed certain accounting presentations used by our pre existing businesses to conform to the presentations used by nrt 
such change resulted in an increase of million in revenues 
excluding the acquisition of nrt s settlement services business and this change in presentation  our settlement services business generated incremental revenues of million compared with title  appraisal and other closing fees all increased due to higher volumes  consistent with the growth in the mortgage origination markets through the first nine months of  as well as cross selling initiatives 
operating and administrative expenses within this segment increased approximately million compared to primarily due to the direct costs incurred in connection with increased mortgage loan production and related servicing activities 
hospitality services revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared with we completed the acquisitions of trendwest  a leading vacation ownership company  in june was acquired in april  equivest finance  inc in february  and several european vacation rental companies during the operating results of the acquired companies were included from the acquisition dates forward and therefore were incremental for the portions of that were pre acquisition periods in accordingly  trendwest  equivest  and the acquired vacation rental companies contributed incremental revenues of million  million and million  respectively  and ebitda of million  million and million  respectively  in compared with in february  we acquired the common interests of ffd development company  llc ffd  the primary developer of timeshare inventory for our fairfield resorts subsidiary 
the operating results of ffd were included from the acquisition date forward and were not significant to our segment results subsequent to our acquisition 
prior to our acquisition  we owned a preferred stock investment in ffd  which accrued a dividend  and we also received additional fees from ffd for providing various support services 
accordingly  prior to our acquisition  ffd contributed revenues and ebitda of million and million  respectively  to results 
excluding the impact from acquisitions described above  revenues in increased million while ebitda declined million and the ebitda margin ebitda as a percentage of revenues dropped from in to in the reduction in ebitda margin was driven principally by a shift in the mix of business operations comprising segment results in compared with and a reduction in travel demand during due to the military conflict in iraq as well as economic pressures  which contributed to suppressing volumes within certain of our hospitality businesses 
despite a challenging travel environment  revenues from sales of vois in our timeshare sales and marketing business increased million in  an increase over this increase was driven primarily by a increase in tour flow and a increase in the average revenue generated per tour at our timeshare resort sites 
the growth in our timeshare sales and marketing businesses positively impacted the segment results and also contributed to a lower year over year segment ebitda margin  as this business typically operates with lower margins than our lodging franchise and timeshare exchange businesses  which have greater operating leverage 
net interest income generated from the financing extended to voi buyers decreased million as the effects of growth in the loan portfolio were more than offset by the impact of consolidating our principal timeshare securitization structure in september and  at such time  no longer recording gains on the sale of receivables to such entity see note to our consolidated financial statements 
timeshare subscription and exchange fee revenues within our timeshare exchange business increased million  primarily due to a increase in the average fee per exchange  which was partially offset by a reduction in the volume of exchange 
table of contents transactions 
the increase in the average exchange fee includes a favorable yield on increased rentals of excess rci vacation interval inventory to rci members in compared with royalties and marketing and reservation fund revenues within our lodging franchise operations declined million in due to a decline in the number of weighted average rooms available following our decision to terminate from our franchise system certain properties that were not meeting required standards 
however  such quality control initiatives also contributed to an increase in the occupancy levels and average daily room rates at our lodging brands  and  as a result  revenue per available room increased period over period and partially offset the impact on royalties from the reduction in available rooms 
our lodging franchise business and our franchisees were unfavorably impacted by the weaker travel environment  as previously discussed  and as a result  during  we recorded an incremental million of non cash expenses related to the doubtful collectability of certain franchisee receivables 
in addition  although revenues and ebitda were nominally impacted on a consolidated basis  preferred alliance revenues within this segment declined million in due to a change in the allocation of such revenues 
revenues received from preferred vendors in substantially benefited the hospitality services segment whereas in  the benefits of such revenues extended to business units within other reportable segments 
excluding acquisitions  operating and administrative expenses within this segment increased approximately million in principally due to increased timeshare sales related expenses  including marginal expense increases on higher sales volumes  higher product costs on developed timeshare inventory and an increased investment in marketing spending to enhance tour flow 
travel distribution services revenues and ebitda declined million and million  respectively  in compared with like other industry participants  this segment was unfavorably impacted by weak global travel demand during travel demand in was negatively affected by various factors  including the military conflict in iraq and terrorist threat alerts  continuing economic pressures and sars concerns in the asia pacific region and other parts of the world 
such factors suppressed bookings and revenues across our travel distribution businesses  but primarily impacted international travel volumes 
galileo worldwide air booking fees decreased million primarily due to a decline in international gds booking volumes  partially offset by domestic gds booking volumes  which stabilized in compared with galileo acquired certain european national distribution companies ndcs during ndcs are independent organizations that market and sell galileo global distribution and computer reservation services to travel agents and other subscribers 
the ndc acquisitions contributed incremental subscriber fee revenues and ebitda of million and million  respectively  in during the summer of  we also acquired two other companies that supply reservation and distribution services to the hospitality industry 
the operating results of such companies were included from the acquisition dates forward and collectively contributed revenue of million with a nominal ebitda impact during in april  we completed the acquisition of trip network inc  an online travel agent that operated the online travel services business of cheap tickets 
from the acquisition date forward  trip network generated million of revenues and had an ebitda loss of million in in addition  principally as a result of our ownership of trip network  an incremental million of intercompany segment revenues were eliminated in  most of which were trip network revenues earned from galileo for airline bookings made by trip network using galileo s gds system 
our online booking volumes grew in compared with  primarily due to i a shift in travel bookings from the traditional off line channels to online channels  ii an increase in online travel bookings  and iii increased merchant model hotel bookings where we  as a travel distributor  obtain access to content from travel suppliers at a pre determined price and sell the content  either individually or in a package  to travelers at retail prices that we determine with little or no risk of inventory loss 
additionally  revenues from our off line travel agency business declined million in  as we accelerated our shift to the online channel 
the results of our online and off line travel agency operations are reflective of the general industry decline in travel demand during  as previously discussed  reductions in commission rates paid by airlines  the lack of reduced rate air inventory availability and a decline in travel related clubs which we service 
such results also reflect our investment in the marketing and administration of our online travel services business  which we believe represents a significant opportunity for future growth 

table of contents the ebitda impact of lower gds and travel agency revenues was partially offset by a corresponding decline in variable expenses  reductions in retiree medical costs as a result of post retirement plan amendments and other net reductions in operating expenses from segment wide re engineering and cost containment initiatives implemented in and these operating expense reductions helped mitigate the negative impact of the weak travel environment that existed during additionally  ebitda in was favorably impacted by million in connection with a contract termination settlement during first quarter vehicle services revenues and ebitda increased  million and million  respectively  in compared with primarily due to our november acquisition of substantially all of the domestic assets  as well as selected international operations  of the vehicle rental business of budget group  inc budget s operating results  including integration costs  were included from the acquisition date forward and contributed incremental revenues of  million with an ebitda decline of million in excluding the impact of budget  segment revenues declined million less than  while ebitda increased million in  which is primarily attributable to reduced car rental demand  offset by increased pricing  at avis and favorable results at our wright express fuel card services subsidiary 
avis domestic car rental revenues declined million in compared with the net reduction in domestic car rental revenues at avis was primarily due to a period over period reduction in the total number of car rental days 
this was partially offset by a increase in time and mileage revenue per rental day reflecting an increase in pricing  which has minimal associated incremental costs 
in addition  ebitda  period over period  includes favorable program related interest costs of million on the financing of vehicles due to lower interest rates and million of lower program related depreciation expense on vehicles due to a different mix of vehicles in avis fleet bearing a lower cost in compared with this favorable impact on ebitda was substantially offset by incremental vehicle related net expenses and other operating costs 
the increase in net expenses includes incremental maintenance and damage costs  higher vehicle license and registration fees and unfavorable conditions in the used car market in compared with for vehicles that did not meet the eligibility criteria under our manufacturers repurchase program 
however  the percentage of avis fleet that was determined ineligible for manufacturer repurchase decreased to in from in revenues from avis international operations increased million due to increased transaction volume and the favorable impact to revenues of exchange rates in canada  australia and new zealand  which was principally offset in ebitda by the unfavorable impact on expenses 
wright express  our fuel card services subsidiary  recognized incremental revenues of million in compared with the prior year 
the organic growth was driven by a combination of the addition of new customers and an increase in usage of wright express proprietary fuel card product 
higher gasoline prices also contributed to the revenue growth  since wright express earns a percentage of total gasoline purchases by its clients 
marketing services revenues increased million and ebitda declined million in compared with effective july   pursuant to the provisions of fin  we consolidated trl group 
trl group on a stand alone basis before elimination of intercompany transactions with our retained membership business contributed revenues of million and an ebitda loss of million subsequent to consolidation in apart from the consolidation of trl group  revenues and ebitda declined million and million  respectively  reflecting  as expected  the continued attrition of the membership base retained by us in connection with the outsourcing of our individual membership business to trl group 
however  the unfavorable impact of reduced revenues on ebitda was mitigated by a net reduction in expenses from servicing fewer members 
a smaller membership base resulted in a net revenue reduction of million net of million of increased royalty income from trl group  which was partially offset in ebitda by net favorable membership operating and marketing expenses of million 
as a result of the consolidation of trl group  we eliminated million of intercompany revenues within this segment in  which was substantially comprised of royalty and lease payments made from trl group to our pre existing membership business subsequent to the consolidation of trl group on july  for a more detailed discussion of our relationship with trl group and the consolidation thereof as a result of fin  see note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents additionally  in january  we made modifications to the existing relationship with trl group 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed account of such modifications 
partially offsetting the impact of the attrition in our retained membership business was growth in our insurance wholesale related operations and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the revenues of our international membership business which was principally offset in ebitda by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates on expenses 
revenues from insurance wholesale related operations increased million as a result of favorable claims experience period over period and increased insurance premium collections 
additionally  in second quarter  we ceased marketing and selling new long term care policies within our long term preferred care business  but will continue servicing the existing in force block of policy holders 
this resulted in a reduction in revenue of million with a nominal impact to ebitda 
in  ebitda was also impacted by a million charge for actions taken in third quarter at our international membership business  which included the closure and consolidation of certain facilities and a reduction in staff in the united kingdom 
corporate and other revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared with revenues and ebitda in include a million gain in connection with the sale of our equity investment in entertainment publication  inc during first quarter also  we earned revenues in both and in connection with credit card marketing programs whereby we earn revenues based on a percentage of credit card spending 
additionally  we recognized expenses as cardholders earned points based on credit card usage 
we generated million of incremental revenues and incurred million of additional point related liabilities during in connection with these programs 
partially offsetting the revenue increases were million of incremental intersegment revenue eliminations in due to increased intercompany business activities 
ebitda was favorable year over year principally due to a million net reduction in securities related litigation charges litigation charges less insurance recoveries in compared with principally as a result of the absence in of litigation settlements and accruals established in in connection with all remaining cuc related securities litigation 
also contributing to the favorable ebitda change was a million reduction in bonus expenses and other incentive based compensation 
in addition  ebitda was favorably impacted by a greater absorption of overhead expenses by our reportable operating segments during compared with principally due to revenue growth at our business units expenses are allocated on a percentage of revenue basis and expense allocations in to companies acquired during partially offsetting favorable ebitda was a million accrual recorded in to revise our original estimate of costs to exit a facility in connection with the previous outsourcing of our data center operations 

table of contents financial condition  liquidity and capital resources we present separately the financial data of our management and mortgage programs 
these programs are distinct from our other activities since the assets are generally funded through the issuance of debt that is collateralized by such assets 
specifically  in our vehicle rental  relocation  and vacation ownership and rental businesses  assets under management and mortgage programs are funded through borrowings under asset backed funding or other similar arrangements 
additionally  during  in our former fleet management  mortgage services and fuel card businesses  assets under management and mortgage programs were funded through borrowings under asset backed funding arrangements or unsecured borrowings at our phh subsidiary 
such borrowings are classified as debt under management and mortgage programs 
the income generated by these assets is used  in part  to repay the principal and interest associated with the debt 
cash inflows and outflows relating to the generation or acquisition of such assets and the principal debt repayment or financing of such assets are classified as activities of our management and mortgage programs

cash flows related to our management and mortgage programs may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the timing of the underlying transactions ie  timing of mortgage loan origination versus sale

if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it could result in a material adverse impact to our consolidated results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time 
presented below are those accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results 
however  the majority of our businesses operate in environments where we are paid a fee for a service performed  and therefore the results of the majority of our recurring operations are recorded in our financial statements using accounting policies that are not particularly subjective  nor complex 
mortgage servicing rights 
a mortgage servicing right is the right to receive a portion of the interest coupon and fees collected from the mortgagor for performing specified mortgage servicing activities 
the value of mortgage servicing rights is estimated based upon an internal valuation that reflects management s estimates of expected future cash flows considering prepayment estimates developed using a third party model described below  our historical prepayment rates  portfolio characteristics  interest rates based on interest rate yield curves  implied volatility and other economic factors 
more specifically  we incorporate a probability weighted option adjusted spread oas model to generate and discount cash flows for the msr valuation 
the oas model generates numerous interest rate paths then calculates the msr cash flow at each monthly point for each interest rate path and discounts those cash flows back to the current period 
the msr value is determined by averaging the discounted cash flows from each of the interest rate paths 
the interest rate paths are generated with a random distribution centered around implied forward interest rates  which are determined from the interest rate yield 
table of contents curve at any given point of time 
as of december   the implied forward interest rates project an increase of approximately basis points in the yield of the year treasury note over the next months 
changes in the yield curve will result in changes to the forward rates implied from that yield curve 
as noted above  a key assumption in our estimate of the msr valuation is forecasted prepayments 
we use a third party model to forecast prepayment rates at each monthly point for each interest rate path in the oas model 
the prepayment forecast is based on historical observations of prepayment behavior in similar circumstances 
the prepayment forecast incorporates loan characteristics eg  loan type and note rate and factors such as recent prepayment experience  previous refinance opportunities and estimated levels of home equity to determine the prepayment forecast at each monthly point for each interest rate path 
to the extent that fair value is less than carrying value at the individual strata level which is based upon product type and interest rates of underlying mortgage loans  we would consider the portfolio to have been impaired and record a related charge 
reductions in interest rates different than those used in our models could cause us to use different assumptions in the msr valuation  which could result in a decrease in the estimated fair value of our msr asset  requiring a corresponding reduction in the carrying value of the asset 
to mitigate this risk  we use derivatives that generally increase in value as interest rates decline and conversely decline in value as interest rates increase 
additionally  as interest rates decrease  we have historically experienced increased production revenue resulting from a greater level of refinancings  which over time has historically mitigated the impact on earnings of the decline in our msr asset 
changes in the estimated fair value of the mortgage servicing rights based upon variations in the assumptions eg  future interest rate levels  implied volatility  prepayment speeds cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear 
changes in one assumption may result in changes to another  which may magnify or counteract the fair value sensitivity analysis and would make such an analysis not meaningful 
additionally  further declines in interest rates due to a weakening economy and geopolitical risks  which result in an increase in refinancing activity or changes in assumptions  could adversely impact the valuation 
the carrying value of our msr asset was approximately billion as of december  and the total portfolio that we were servicing approximated billion as of december  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of the effect of any changes to the value of this asset during  and 
the effects of certain adverse potential changes in the estimated fair value of our msr asset are detailed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
financial instruments 
we estimate fair values for each of our financial instruments  including derivative instruments 
most of these financial instruments are not publicly traded on an organized exchange 
in the absence of quoted market prices  we must develop an estimate of fair value using dealer quotes  present value cash flow models  option pricing models or other conventional valuation methods  as appropriate 
the use of these fair value techniques involves significant judgments and assumptions  including estimates of future interest rate levels based on interest rate yield curves  prepayment and volatility factors  and an estimation of the timing of future cash flows 
the use of different assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts recorded in the financial statements  which are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  hedge accounting requires that at the beginning of each hedge period  we justify an expectation that the relationship between the changes in fair value of derivatives designated as hedges compared to changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged items will be highly effective 
this effectiveness assessment  which is performed quarterly  involves an estimation of changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates and corresponding changes in prepayment levels  as well as the probability of the occurrence of transactions for cash flow hedges 
the use of different assumptions and changing market conditions may impact the results of the effectiveness assessment and ultimately the timing of when changes in derivative fair values and the underlying hedged items are recorded in earnings 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of the effect of hypothetical changes to these assumptions 
goodwill 
we have reviewed the carrying value of our goodwill as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair value and determined that the carrying amount of our reporting units did 
table of contents not exceed their respective fair value 
when determining fair value  we utilized various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the respective carrying amount 
in such event  we would then be required to record a charge  which would impact earnings 
we will continue to review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
we provide a wide range of consumer and business services and  as a result  our goodwill is allocated among many diverse reporting units 
accordingly  it is difficult to quantify the impact of an adverse change in financial results and related cash flows  as such change may be isolated to a small number of our reporting units or spread across our entire organization 
in either case  the magnitude of an impairment to goodwill  if any  cannot be estimated 
however  our businesses are concentrated in a few industries and  as a result  an adverse change to any of these industries will impact our consolidated results and may result in impairment of our goodwill 
the aggregate carrying value of our goodwill was approximately billion at december  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for more information on goodwill 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized 
in performing this review  we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
a change in these assumptions could cause an increase or decrease to our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate  which could materially impact our results of operations 
additionally  our income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities 
we establish reserves for tax treatments when  despite our belief that the treatments are fully supportable  certain treatments are likely to be challenged and that we may not succeed 
we adjust our reserves upon the closing of a tax audit  which in some cases can occur several years following the related transaction or the filing of the tax return under examination  or other changes in facts and circumstances that indicate an adjustment may be necessary including subsequent rulings and interpretations by tax authorities or court decisions on similar matters 
changes to the reserves could materially impact our results of operations

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use various financial instruments  particularly swap contracts  futures and options contracts to manage and reduce the interest rate risk related specifically to our debt and certain other interest bearing liabilities 
additionally  we used these financial instruments  as well as forward delivery commitments  to manage and reduce interest rate risk inherent in our former mortgage business and specifically relating to the commited mortgage pipeline  mortgage loan inventory  mortgage servicing rights and mortgage backed securities 
foreign currency forwards are also used to manage and reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign currency denominated receivables and forecasted royalties  forecasted earnings of foreign subsidiaries and other transactions 
we are exclusively an end user of these instruments  which are commonly referred to as derivatives 
we do not engage in trading  market making or other speculative activities in the derivatives markets 
more detailed information about these financial instruments is provided in note financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements 
our principal market exposures are interest and foreign currency rate risks 
l interest rate movements in one country  as well as relative interest rate movements between countries can materially impact our profitability 
our primary interest rate exposure is to interest rate fluctuations in the united states  specifically long term us treasury and mortgage interest rates due to their impact on mortgage related assets and commitments and also libor and commercial paper interest rates due to their impact on variable rate borrowings and other interest rate sensitive liabilities 
we anticipate that such interest rates will remain a primary market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
l we have foreign currency rate exposure to exchange rate fluctuations worldwide and particularly with respect to the british pound  canadian dollar  australian dollar and euro 
we anticipate that such foreign currency exchange rate risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we assess our market risk based on changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis measures the potential impact in earnings  fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates 
the fair values of mortgage loans  commitments to fund mortgages and mortgage backed securities are determined from market sources 
the fair values of relocation receivables and equity advances on homes approximate carrying values due to the short term nature of these assets 
we use a discounted cash flow model in determining the fair values of timeshare receivables  mortgage servicing rights and our retained interests in securitized assets 
the primary assumptions used in determining fair value are prepayment speeds  estimated loss rates and discount rates 
in determining the fair value of mortgage servicing rights  the model also utilizes credit losses and mortgage servicing revenues and expenses as primary assumptions 
in addition  for commitments to fund mortgages  the borrower s propensity to close their mortgage loan under the commitment is used as a primary assumption 
for mortgage loans  commitments to fund mortgages  forward delivery contracts and options  we rely on market sources in determining the impact of interest rate shifts 
we also utilize a probability weighted option adjusted spread model to determine the impact of interest rate shifts on mortgage servicing rights 
the primary assumptions in this model are the implied market volatility of interest rates and prepayment speeds and the same primary assumptions are used in determining fair value 
we use a duration based model in determining the impact of interest rate shifts on our debt portfolio  certain other interest bearing liabilities and interest rate derivatives portfolios 
the primary assumption used in these models is that a increase or decrease in the benchmark interest rate produces a parallel shift in the yield curve across all maturities 
we use a current market pricing model to assess the changes in the value of the us dollar on foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and derivatives 
the primary assumption used in these models is a hypothetical weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against all our currency exposures at december   and 
table of contents our total market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including the volatility present within the markets and the liquidity of the markets 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented 
while probably the most meaningful analysis  these shock tests are constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and the inability to include the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
we used december   and market rates on our instruments to perform the sensitivity analyses separately for each of our market risk exposures interest and currency rate instruments 
the estimates are based on the market risk sensitive portfolios described in the preceding paragraphs and assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves and exchange rates 
we have determined that the impact of a change in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and prices on our earnings  fair values and cash flows would not be material 
while these results may be used as benchmarks  they should not be viewed as forecasts
