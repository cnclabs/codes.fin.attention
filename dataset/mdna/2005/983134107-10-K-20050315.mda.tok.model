however  we cannot predict the libor rates that will be in effect in the future 
accordingly  the libor rate at december  equal to is used for all calculations in the table below 
as of december  thereafter total in millions long term debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate n a n a consistent with our obligation under our former credit facilities to obtain interest rate protection for at least million of borrowings thereunder  in may and june  we entered into two interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the underlying interest rate risk on a total of million of our expected future borrowings under our former credit facilities  which bore interest at libor plus and libor plus  on the former revolving credit facility and the former term loan facility  respectively  and were to mature in october and october  respectively 
on december   concurrent with the refinancing of wynn las vegas debt structure  we terminated the two interest rate swaps 
as a result of the termination  we received a cash of approximately million in settlement of the related asset 
the balance of million in accumulated other comprehensive income related to those interest rate swaps will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the original contract life of the two interest rate swaps 
also concurrent with the refinancing  we entered into two new interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the underlying interest rate risk on a total of million of our expected future borrowings under our new term loan facility  which bears interest at libor plus 
under each of these two new interest rate swap arrangements  we will receive payments at a variable rate of libor and pay a fixed rate of on million notional amount set forth in the swap instruments from february and march  respectively through december these effective dates of the two swaps were designed to correspond with the amounts and timing of our expected borrowings under the new term loan facility 
the interest rate swaps are expected to be effective as hedging instruments as long as sufficient libor based borrowings are outstanding under the new term loan facility  and effectively fixes the interest rate on borrowings under the new term loan facility at approximately 
any ineffectiveness will increase our recorded interest expense in our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we recorded in other assets the fair value of the net effect of the two former interest rate swaps of approximately million 
because there had been no ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship  the corresponding change in fair value of equal amount was reported in other comprehensive income for the year ended december  as of december   we recorded in other assets the fair value of the net effect of the two new interest rate swaps of approximately  because there has been no ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship  the corresponding change in fair value of equal amount is reported in other comprehensive income for the year ended december  the following table provides information about our interest rate swaps as of december  and using estimated future libor rates based upon implied forward rates in the yield curve expected averages as of december  thereafter total in millions average notional amount n a average pay rate n a average receive rate n a we do not use derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
for the year ended december   we incurred approximately million in interest 
certain amounts of our outstanding indebtedness for the year was based upon a variable  libor rate plus a premium 
a increase in the libor would have increased our interest cost for by approximately million 
foreign currency risks the currency used in wynn macau s concession agreement with the government of macau is the macau pataca 
the macau pataca  which is not a freely convertible currency  is linked to the hong kong dollar  and in many cases the two are used interchangeably in macau 
the hong kong dollar is linked to the us dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years 
however  the exchange linkages of the hong kong dollar and the macau pataca  and the hong kong dollar and the us dollar  are subject to potential changes due to  among other things  changes in chinese governmental policies and international economic and political developments 
certain asian countries have publicly asserted their desire to eliminate the linkage of the hong kong dollar and the chinese renminbi to the us dollar 
as a result  we cannot assure you that the hong kong dollar  the chinese renminbi and the macau pataca will continue to be linked to the us dollar  which may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate for these currencies 
we also cannot assure you that the current peg rate for these currencies will remain at the same level 
any change in such peg rate could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make payments on certain of our debt instruments 
because wynn macau s payment and expenditure obligations under the concession agreement are in macau patacas  in the event of unfavorable macau pataca or hong kong dollar rate changes  wynn macau s obligations  as denominated in us dollars  would increase 
in addition  because we expect that most of the revenue for any casino that wynn macau operates in macau will be in hong kong dollars  we are subject to foreign exchange risk with respect to the exchange rate between the hong kong dollar and the us dollar 
wynn macau intends to spend any macau patacas received on local casino operating expenses 
also  if any of our macau related entities incur us dollar denominated debt  fluctuations in the exchange rates of the macau pataca or the hong kong dollar  in relation to the us dollar  could have adverse effects on wynn macau s ability to service its debt  its results of operations and its financial condition 
we have not yet determined whether we will engage in hedging activities to protect against foreign currency risk
