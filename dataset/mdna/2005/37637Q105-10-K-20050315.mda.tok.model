item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december  compared to december  the following discussion is intended to provide a more comprehensive review of the company s operating results and financial condition than can be obtained from reading the consolidated financial statements alone 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto included later in this report 
all numbers  except per share data  are expressed in thousands of dollars 
highlights and overview this past year the company experienced strong loan growth with total loans outstanding increasing by million  or percent from the prior year 
all loan classifications experienced increases with commercial loan growth leading the way with an increase of million  or percent 
the low interest rates for real estate loans continued through however the pace of home loan refinancing slowed substantially from the level 
the slowing of refinance activity combined with a renewed focus on shorter term  and variable rate loans resulted in an increase in real estate loans of million  or percent  during the year 
consumer loans  primarily home equity loans  increased by million  or percent 
the average interest rate on loans continued to decline as repayments on higher rate loans continued to occur and new loans were booked at reduced rates 
increases in targeted interest rates by the federal reserve board during and into should help reverse this trend 
the increased volume of loans more than offset the lower rates so that loan interest income increased from because of the increased loan balances which used available funding  and reduced spreads on funding costs versus investment returns  total investments declined from the prior year 
with the reduction in refinancing of home loans  prepayments on mortgage backed securities were substantially reduced resulting in a lower level of premium amortization which increased the earnings on investments 
maturing higher rate certificates of deposit and borrowed funds reduced average interest rates paid from the prior year  however  increased borrowed funds by the subsidiary banks and the issuance of million in subordinated debentures by the parent company  resulted in increased interest expense 
non interest bearing deposits increased during the year providing a stable low cost funding source for a portion of the asset growth 
interest bearing deposits also ended the year with increased totals 
asset growth that exceeded the increase in deposits was funded with federal home loan bank advances and other borrowed funds 
with the reduction in mortgage loan refinance activity  the origination of residential loans decreased by percent from  however the gain on sale of loans declined percent  the result of retaining more of the loans originated 
service charges and fee income increased nicely in  primarily the result of increased account volumes 
the net gain on the sale of securities of million during was not repeated in with a net of zero for the year 
total revenue from net interest income and non interest income increased million  or  over the prior year  the cumulative effect of the above described items 
non interest expense increased million  or  from last year with the largest increase occurring in compensation and benefits 
additional locations and related staffing and merit increases were the primary reasons for this increase 
other operating expenses also increased reflecting the increased volume of activities in loan and deposit operations 
looking forward  our future performance will depend on many factors including economic conditions  interest rate changes  increasing competition for deposits and quality loans  and regulatory burden 
increasing interest rates slow the volume of real estate loan originations which reduces the fee income from that activity while at the same time reducing commission expense for loan originators 
increasing rates result in increased earnings on assets  however  the cost of interest bearing funds also increases 
the company goal of asset and liability management practices is to maintain or increase the level of net interest income within an acceptable level of interest rate risk 
regulatory burden seems to be never ending as additional regulations continue to add cost 
the sarbanes oxley act sox resulted in substantial increases in audit and consulting fees during  and a major diversion of internal staff time from normal duties  primarily to satisfy the internal control requirements of section of sox 
costs to assure compliance in future years  including ongoing compliance with sox  are projected to remain high 
financial condition assets the following table summarizes the asset balances as of december  and  the amount of change  and percentage change during december  assets in thousands change change cash on hand and in banks    investment securities  fhlb and frb stock  and interest bearing deposits    loans real estate    commercial    consumer    total loans    allowance for loan losses    total loans net of allowance for loan losses    other assets    total assets    at december  total assets were billion which is million greater than the december  assets of billion  an increase of percent 
total loans have increased million from december   an increase of percent  with the growth occurring in all loan categories 
commercial loans increased million  or percent  real estate loans gained million  or percent  and consumer loans grew by million  or percent 
loan volume continues to be very strong with loans increasing million during the fourth quarter which has historically been a slow quarter for loan growth 
investment securities  including interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions  have decreased million from december  without the approximately million of proceeds of the march issuance of trust preferred securities that are invested in investment securities  total investments would have declined million from last year 
some of the cash flow from investment maturities is now being used to fund the significant growth in loans 
the following table summarizes the major asset components as a percentage of total assets as of december    and december  assets cash  and cash equivalents  investment securities  fhlb and federal reserve stock real estate loans and loans held for sale commercial loans consumer loans other assets the percentage of assets held as cash  and cash equivalents  investment securities  fhlb and federal reserve stock has decreased from percent at december  to percent at december  the decrease is attributed to a million reduction in investment securities during and the increase in total assets resulting from the large increase in loans outstanding 
strong economic activity in the markets served by the company  combined with excellent customer service  made the loan growth possible 
the company continues to focus on quality loan growth of all types 
liabilities the following table summarizes the liability balances as of december  and  the amount of change  and percentage change during december  liabilities in thousands change change non interest bearing deposits    interest bearing deposits    advances from federal home loan bank    securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowed funds    other liabilities    subordinated debentures    total liabilities    non interest bearing deposits have increased million  or percent  since december  this continues to be a primary focus of our banks and the programs we have initiated this past year continue to gain momentum 
total deposits have increased million from december  this growth in deposits  a low cost stable funding source  gives us increased flexibility in managing our asset mix 
federal home loan bank advances have also increased  million from december   as we continue to take advantage of the flexibility of that funding source 
in addition  repurchase agreements and other borrowed funds have increased from the prior year as we continue to use these cost effective sources of funding 
on march   subordinated debentures in the form of trust preferred securities of million  with an interest rate of percent  were issued 
the proceeds will be used to fund the pending acquisitions 
december  liabilities and stockholder s equity deposit accounts fhlb advances other borrowings and repurchase agreements other liabilities stockholders equity with a million increase in stockholders equity and the million increase in subordinated debentures included in the other liabilities line above  the percentage of assets funded by deposits decreased even with the substantial increase in deposit balances 
december  stockholders equity in thousands except per share data change change common equity    accumulated other comprehensive income   total stockholders equity    stockholders equity to total assets book value per common share market price per share at end of quarter stockholders equity total equity and book value per share amounts have increased substantially from the prior year  primarily the result of earnings retention  and stock options exercised 
accumulated other comprehensive income  representing net unrealized gains on securities available for sale of million at december  is slightly less than the million at year end  with the decline primarily a function of interest rate changes 
results of operations operating results include amounts related to the operation of the three branches acquired with the pend oreille bank as of july  and the ione  washington branch as of june  years ended december  revenue summary in thousands change change net interest income    fees and other revenue service charges  loan fees  and other fees    gain on sale of loans    gain on sale of investments  net of impairment charge   other income   total non interest income    tax equivalent net interest margin net interest income net interest income increased million  or percent  over total interest income was million  or percent higher than  while total interest expense was million  or percent higher 
the investment portfolio generated approximately percent of the increase in interest income 
additional interest income from the large increase in loans outstanding was partially offset by lower rates on the loan portfolio due to refinancing  and re pricing of existing loans 
the increase in interest expense is attributed to the increase in the subordinated debentures which increased interest expense by million 
interest expense on deposits declined million  or percent  from reductions in rates on maturing fixed term interest bearing deposits 
interest on federal home loan bank borrowings and other borrowed funds increased million  or percent  from increased volumes and increasing interest rates 
the net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets  on a tax equivalent basis  was percent which was a decrease from percent for non interest income fee income increased million  or percent  over last year  driven primarily by an increased number of loan and deposit accounts and the fee income associated with this growth in accounts 
gain on sale of loans decreased million  or percent  from last year  because of greatly reduced refinance activity 
loan origination activity for housing  especially new construction  remains quite strong in our markets 
in gains on sale of investments  net of impairment charge  of million were recorded and zero gains were realized in years ended december  non interest expense summary in thousands change change compensation and employee benefits and related expense    occupancy and equipment expense   outsourced data processing   core deposit intangibles amortization   other expenses    total non interest expense    non interest expense non interest expense increased by million  or percent  from including expenses from the acquisitions  two additional branches in boise  idaho  and a new branch in downtown bozeman  montana 
compensation and benefit expense increased million  or percent  with the additional bank branches  normal compensation increases for job performance and increased cost for benefits tied to company performance  accounting for the majority of the increase 
occupancy and equipment expense increased thousand  or percent  reflecting the cost of the additional locations and facility upgrades 
other expenses increased million  or percent  primarily from start up expenses on implementing the high performance checking program at the four banks not previously on the program  additional advertising expense  thousand increase in audit and consulting expenses  and costs associated with new branch offices and the acquisitions 
the efficiency ratio non interest expense net interest income non interest income was percent  improving slightly from the percent in  excluding the gain on sale of securities 
december  december  credit quality information in thousands allowance for loan losses   non performing assets   allowance as a percentage of non performing assets non performing assets as a percentage of total assets allowance as a percentage of total loans net charge offs as a percentage of loans provision for loan losses non performing assets as a percentage of total assets at december  were at 
percent  a decrease from 
percent at december  this compares favorably to the federal reserve bank peer group average of 
percent at september   the most recent information available 
the allowance for loan losses was percent of non performing assets at december   compared to percent a year ago 
the allowance has increased million  or percent  from a year ago to million  which is percent of december  total loans outstanding  down slightly from the percent a year ago 
the fourth quarter provision for loan losses expense was million  an increase of thousand from the same quarter in effect of inflation and changing prices generally accepted accounting principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without consideration for change in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation 
virtually all assets of a financial institution are monetary in nature  therefore  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a company s performance than does the effect of inflation 
commitments in the normal course of business  there are various outstanding commitments to extend credit  such as letter of credit and un advanced loan commitments  which are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
management does not anticipate any material losses as a result of these transactions 
the company has outstanding debt maturities  the largest of which are the advances from the federal home loan bank 
see footnote for the maturity schedule of the advances 
the following table represents our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period indeterminate dollars in thousands total maturity thereafter deposits        advances from the fhlb       repurchase agreements   subordinated debentures   capital lease obligations 
  operating lease obligations     represents interest and non interest bearing checking  money market  and savings accounts market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels trends 
interest rate risk the objective of interest rate risk management is to contain the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
the process involves identification and management of the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates 
managing interest rate risk is not an exact science 
the interval between repricing of interest rates of assets and liabilities changes from day to day as the assets and liabilities change 
for some assets and liabilities contractual maturity and the actual cash flows experienced are not the same 
a good example is residential mortgages that have long term contractual maturities but may be repaid well in advance of the maturity when current prevailing interest rates become lower than the contractual rate 
interest bearing deposits without a stated maturity could be withdrawn after seven days  however  the bank s experience indicates that these funding pools have a much longer duration and are not as sensitive to interest rate changes as other financial instruments 
prime based loans generally have rate changes when the federal reserve bank changes short term interest rates  however  depending on the magnitude of the rate change and the relationship of the current rates to rate floors and rate ceilings that may be in place on the loans  the loan rate may not change 
gap analysis the following table gives a description of our gap position for various time periods 
as of december   we had a negative gap position at six months and a positive gap position at twelve months 
the cumulative gap as a percentage of total assets for six months is a negative which compares to a negative at december  and a negative at december  the table also shows the gap earnings sensitivity  and earnings sensitivity ratio  along with a brief description as to how they are calculated 
the methodology used to compile this gap information is based on our mix of assets and liabilities and the historical experience accumulated regarding their rate sensitivity 
projected maturity or repricing more than dollars in thousands months months years years total assets interest bearing deposits   investment securities      mortgage backed securities      fhlb stock and frb stock    floating rate loans      fixed rate loans      total interest bearing assets      liabilities interest bearing deposits      fhlb advances      repurchase agreements and other borrowed funds   total interest bearing liabilities      repricing gap      cumulative repricing gap     cumulative gap as a of total assets gap earnings sensitivity gap earnings sensitivity ratio gap earnings sensitivity is the estimated effect on income  after taxes of  of a increase or decrease in interest rates of   gap earnings sensitivity ratio is gap earnings sensitivity divided by the estimated yearly earnings of  a increase in interest rates has this estimated percentage increase effect on annual income 
this table estimates the repricing maturities of the company s assets and liabilities  based upon the company s assessment of the repricing characteristics of the various instruments 
interest bearing checking and regular savings are included in the more than years category 
money market balances are included in the less than months category 
mortgage backed securities are at the anticipated principal payments based on the weighted average life 
net interest income simulation the traditional one dimensional view of gap is not sufficient to show a bank s ability to withstand interest rate changes 
because of limitations in gap modeling the asset liability management committee alco of the company uses a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income nii to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated nii sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s statement of financial condition 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for nii exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth  given a or basis point bp upward and downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed as a benchmark 
other non parallel rate movement scenarios are also modeled to determine the potential impact on net interest income 
the following reflects the company s nii sensitivity analysis as of december  and as compared to the board approved policy limit 
bp estimated sensitivity estimated decrease in net interest income   bp estimated sensitivity estimated increase in net interest income  the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of assets and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the possibility that the company will not be able to fund present and future obligations 
the objective of liquidity management is to maintain cash flows adequate to meet current and future needs for credit demand  deposit withdrawals  maturing liabilities and corporate operating expenses 
core deposits  fhlb credit lines  available for sale investment securities  and net income are the key elements in meeting these objectives 
all seven subsidiaries are members of the fhlb 
this membership provides for established lines of credit in the form of advances that are a supplemental source of funds for lending and other general business purposes 
as of year ended december   the company had  million of available fhlb line of which million was utilized 
accordingly  management of the company has a wide range of versatility in managing the liquidity and asset liability mix for each individual institution as well as the company as a whole 
during  all seven financial institutions maintained liquidity levels in excess of regulatory requirements and deemed sufficient to meet operating cash needs 
capital resources and adequacy maintaining capital strength has been a long term objective 
ample capital is necessary to sustain growth  provide protection against unanticipated declines in asset values  and to safeguard the funds of depositors 
capital also is a source of funds for loan demand and enables the company to effectively manage its assets and liabilities 
shareholders equity increased million during  or percent the net result of earnings of million  less cash dividend payments and a decline of thousand in the net unrealized gains on available for sale investment securities 
for additional information see footnote in the consolidated financial statements 
dividend payments were increased by 
per share  or percent in the payment of dividends is subject to government regulation  in that regulatory authorities may prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying dividends which would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
critical accounting policies companies may apply certain critical accounting policies requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to estimate the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company considers its only material critical accounting policy to be the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged against earnings 
the balance of allowance for loan losses is maintained at the amount management believes will be adequate to absorb known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the appropriate balance of allowance for loan losses is determined by applying estimated loss factors to the credit exposure from outstanding loans 
estimated loss factors are based on subjective measurements including management s assessment of the internal risk classifications  changes in the nature of the loan portfolio  industry concentrations and the impact of current local  regional and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations or liquidity 
for additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses  its relation to the provision for loans losses and risk related to asset quality  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in december  the aicpa issued statement of position  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer sop which addresses the accounting for certain acquired loans or debt securities that have experienced a deterioration of credit quality between the loan origination date and the date the loan is acquired by an investor  and for which it is probable  at acquisition  that the investor will be unable to collect all contractually required payments on the loan 
when loans within the scope of this sop are acquired by the completion of a transfer  it is not appropriate at acquisition to establish an allowance for loan losses related to those acquired loans 
the purchase price represents the fair value of the loans on the date of acquisition and an allowance for loan losses should be recorded by the investor only to the extent there is a change in the estimate of credit losses subsequent to acquisition of the loan and only to the extent of losses incurred subsequent to acquisition 
likewise  loans within the scope of this sop that are acquired in a purchase business combination should be recognized initially at the present value of amounts expected to be received and no allowance for loan losses should be carried over related to these loans at acquisition 
sop requires initial application for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  in december  the financial accounting standards board issued a revised version of sfas no 
share based payment  mandating that companies measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
the intrinsic value method of accounting for such awards  as previously elected by the company and provided for in apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees will no longer acceptable under gaap for public companies effective for accounting periods ending after june  if no comparable market values are available  the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments is to be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments 
under the previous provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation companies using the intrinsic value method were required to disclose in a footnote to their financial statements the effect on net income of using the intrinsic value rather than the grant date fair value method 
the company has continued to use the intrinsic value method  with appropriate disclosures  in its financial statements through december  see stock based compensation under note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company expects to adopt sfas no 
revised effective with its reporting for the third quarter of management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations year ended december  compared to december  results of operations operating results include amounts related to the operation of the three branches acquired in the pend oreille acquisition as of july  revenue summary in thousands years ended december  change change net interest income    fees and other revenue service charges  loan fees  and other fees    gain on sale of loans    gain on sale of investments  net of impairment charge   other income   total non interest income    total revenue    tax equivalent net interest margin net income of million was a million increase over the million for the year ended december   an increase of percent 
the following narrative provides additional information on those results 
interest income historical low interest rates during most of the year resulted in a million reduction in interest income even though the earning assets of the company increased significantly 
with the sustained low rates throughout the year many loans of all types were refinanced with the rate on the new loans substantially lower than the prepaid loans 
new loans also were at much lower rates than the average rates earned on the existing loans 
mortgage related investment securities experienced much of the same results as the loan portfolio 
investments were prepaid which negatively impacted interest income in two ways securities that were purchased at a premium that experienced prepayments had an acceleration of the amortization of the premium which reduced the income  reinvestment of the proceeds was at a lower rate than previously enjoyed on the amounts invested 
the weighted average yield on earning assets tax free income adjusted for tax effects decreased from percent for the year to percent in increased balances in earning assets offset much of the rate impact 
interest expense interest expense decreased even more with total interest expense million  or percent  lower in most of the expense reduction came from deposits as rates continued to decline during the year 
in addition higher rate certificates of deposits matured which further reduced interest expense 
these rate reductions coupled with increasing balances in non interest bearing deposits resulted in the deposit expense reduction 
the balance in fhlb advances increased million during the year  however  with a combination of maturing higher cost advances and lower rates on new advances the interest expense on total advances decreased by  from the prior year 
the weighted average rate on advances decreased from percent for to for the weighted rate on total advances outstanding at december  was percent 
the prolonged low interest rates have resulted in a reduction in the net interest margin ratio of net interest income divided by average earning assets from percent in to percent in with the third quarter of being the lowest level at percent 
the ratio increased to percent in the fourth quarter of primarily due to increased earnings on investments 
with the low interest rates many real estate loans have either been refinanced which lowers the future earnings rate on the loans that are retained  or the loan is paid off which also lowers future earnings 
to remain competitive it has become necessary to reduce rates to market levels on all loan types which reduces interest income on those loans 
investment income also is lower on securities purchased during this low rate period than on securities previously held in the portfolio 
prepayment of mortgage backed securities also has occurred as underlying mortgage loans have been prepaid 
this prepayment not only reduced the level of assets with higher rates but also resulted in much faster amortization of premiums associated with the securities further reducing interest income 
to offset the reduction in interest income  rates on interest bearing deposits have been reduced and matured borrowings have been renewed at lower rates 
the increased level of non interest bearing deposits has reduced the need for additional borrowings which also has resulted in lower interest expense 
non interest income total non interest income increased million  or percent over the prior year 
million of the increase was from increased volumes in loan and deposit activity and the resulting fees 
million of the increase was contributed by net gains on sale of investment securities 
the largest portion of the increase was from a million increase in the gain on sale of loans  the majority of which was from residential real estate loans 
the low interest rates during resulted in a very large increase in the number of loans being refinanced to obtain low long term financing  and an increase in new home loans because of affordable monthly payments 
increasing rates affect the level of fee income created from the origination and sale of mortgage loans as the refinance of loans is substantially reduced or eliminated 
purchases of homes can also be affected because of reduced affordability due to higher monthly payments with higher interest rates 
the subsidiary banks are located in areas of robust population growth which somewhat mitigates the risk of significant reduction in home purchases 
reduction in refinance activity also reduces the variable expenses such as commissions for loan origination and could result in additional reductions in expense 
non interest expense summary in thousands years ended december  change change compensation and employee benefits    occupancy and equipment expense   outsourced data processing   core deposit intangibles amortization   other expenses    total non interest expense    non interest expense non interest expense also increased million  a percent increase  with million of the increase in the compensation and benefits classification 
the pend oreille acquisition  additional branches in the boise and bozeman markets  commissions paid to mortgage loan originators  normal increases for job performance  and some benefits that are tied to the company stock price performance account for the majority of the increase 
advertising and marketing  start up expenses for the high performance checking program  and other volume related expenses made up most of the remainder of the increased expense 
the efficiency ratio  which measures the cost per dollar of revenue generated  increased from percent in to percent in although this increased from the prior year it is still significantly less than the percent average of similar sized banking companies
