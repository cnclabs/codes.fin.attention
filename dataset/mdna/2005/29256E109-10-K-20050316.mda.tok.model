item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide an understanding of our results of operations  financial condition and where appropriate  factors that may affect future performance 
we will discuss and provide our analysis of the following overview of business and results key industry trends  events and uncertainties results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates recent accounting pronouncements significant demands liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations  commercial commitments and leases 
table of contents the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to those financial statements as well as the other financial data included elsewhere in this form k 
overview of business and results we are a diversified orthopedic company that designs  manufactures  markets and distributes a comprehensive range of high quality orthopedic devices including surgical implants  products for orthopedic rehabilitation  pain management and physical therapy  and sports medicine equipment 
our products are used primarily by orthopedic surgeons  physical and occupational therapists  athletic trainers and other healthcare specialists who treat patients with musculoskeletal conditions resulting from degenerative diseases  deformities  and sports related injuries  and our non invasive medical devices and related accessories are primarily used by patients for at home therapy 
we currently market and distribute our products through two operating divisions  as follows surgical implant division 
our surgical implant division offers reconstructive joint products  including hip  knee  shoulder  and spinal implants for the orthopedic surgical market 
orthopedic rehabilitation division 
our orthopedic rehabilitation division offers non invasive medical products that are used before and after surgery to assist in the repair and rehabilitation of soft tissue and bone  and to protect against further injury  electrotherapy devices and accessories used to treat pain and restore muscle function  iontophoretic devices and accessories used to deliver medication  clinical therapy tables and traction equipment  and orthotics devices used to treat joint and spine conditions 
our two divisions enable us to reach a diverse customer base through multiple distribution channels and give us the opportunity to provide a comprehensive range of orthopedic devices and related products to orthopedic specialists operating in a variety of treatment settings for their patients 
our products are subject to regulation by the food and drug administration fda with respect to their sale in the united states  and we must  in many cases  obtain fda authorization to market our products before they can be sold in the united states 
additionally  we are subject to similar regulations in many of the international countries in which we sell products 
in october  we announced our strategy to expand our business through selected acquisitions of businesses or products in the orthopedic industry 
we have completed four acquisitions since that time that have allowed us to extend our business in the orthopedic market to include rehabilitation equipment and orthopedic soft goods  which complement our surgical implant division 
in july  we purchased the orthopedic soft goods  patient safety devices and pressure care product lines of kimberly clark corporation 
in february  we purchased chattanooga group  inc  a provider of orthopedic rehabilitation products offering a wide variety of rehabilitation and home health products for orthopedic professionals for use in their clinics 
on october   we purchased empi  inc  a provider of non invasive medical devices and accessories that are primarily used by patients for at home therapy 
in february  we acquired substantially all the assets of osteoimplant technology  inc  which included a broad line of spinal implant products 
we have financed our recent acquisitions through the sale of equity securities and the issuance of additional debt 
we financed our soft goods acquisition principally by applying a portion of the proceeds from the sale of series a preferred stock 
the series a preferred stock was subsequently converted into shares of our common stock in august we financed the chattanooga group  inc acquisition with debt  which was subsequently repaid from the net proceeds of a public offering of our common stock in august we financed the empi acquisition through a combination of the issuance of new equity and the issuance of both senior secured and senior subordinated unsecured debt  which was obtained from financial institutions and institutional investors 
we expect that we will continue to utilize some combination of both debt and equity funding as we continue to implement our strategy of growth through acquisition 
the nature of our business requires significant investment in inventory  capital equipment and new product development 
our customers expect us to maintain sufficient inventory on hand at all times to meet their needs 
our domestic customers in the surgical implant division require consignment product be placed at or near their respective locations 
our remaining customers across all product lines demand short delivery schedules for their orders 
additionally  we are subject to significant requirements for investment in manufacturing equipment and facilities and for the instrument sets required by our surgical implant division customers 
finally  we have placed an emphasis on our research and development efforts for new products  particularly with respect to our surgical implant division 
in  net sales increased to million compared to million for our operating performance was driven by continued growth in both our surgical implant and orthopedic rehabilitation divisions  and the 
table of contents inclusion of three months of results from empi  which was acquired on october  our domestic surgical implant division sales increased over  as we continue to build our united states sales force for reconstruction and spinal products 
orthopedic rehabilitation division fourth quarter revenue increased significantly due to continued strength in our electrotherapy and dysphagia product lines and the impact of revenues associated with the empi acquisition 
gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to in compared to in as a result of improved gross margin in the orthopedic rehabilitation division  which was primarily attributable to empi product line sales 
gross margin was impacted by fourth quarter increases to our surgical division s inventory reserves of approximately million 
this additional provision principally related to the write off of our trauma product line inventory  which was based on our strategic decision to focus our surgical implant division business on its growing knee  hip and shoulder product lines  along with its spinal product line 
operating income improved to million in compared to million in during  we issued  shares of common stock and  of senior subordinated notes due in connection with our acquisition of empi 
we also entered into a new  senior secured credit facility to finance the empi acquisition  fund working capital requirements  and for general corporate purposes 
key industry trends  events and uncertainties the orthopedic industry has been experiencing a growth trend that we expect to continue over the short and long term 
two primary contributing factors to this trend are the aging population and technological innovation 
the baby boomer generation continues to age and  as a result  the need for reconstructive implants  sports medicine  rehabilitation equipment and related products is growing 
in addition  people are living longer and more active lives thereby increasing the frequency of injury 
furthermore  desire for medical treatment to cure injuries and reduce pain is reducing the age at which orthopedic products and services are required 
technological innovation is also fueling growth in this industry 
improvements are continually introduced to expand the life of implants and minimize the invasiveness of the surgery required 
these innovations are reducing the average age when a patient can consider the use of implantable orthopedic devices 
results of operations the following table sets forth our statements of operations as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development income from operations interest income interest expense early extinguishment of debt other  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes minority interest net income loss 
table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our net sales for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of over revenue of million in  driven by continued growth in both our surgical implant and orthopedic rehabilitation divisions 
revenue in included results from the empi acquisition  which was completed on october  the following table sets forth the sales geographic mix for both of our divisions 
the amounts shown for the orthopedic rehabilitation division include million of sales by empi for the three month period from the date of acquisition 
in thousands  except domestic international total growth growth growth surgical implant division orthopedic rehabilitation division total we continue to increase our market penetration in domestic surgical implant sales as we continue to build our united states sales force for reconstruction and spinal products 
in the surgical implant division  we had sales of million for the year ended december  compared to million in  an increase of 
domestic surgical implant division sales for grew to million compared to million in our surgical implant division introduced to the market a new large head  metal on metal hip system in the fourth quarter  representing the fifth new product introduced by this division in we made a strategic decision to focus our surgical implant division business on its growing knee  hip and shoulder product lines  along with its spinal product line  which was strengthened by a recent acquisition 
international sales of million in were comparable to the prior year s million in sales 
our orthopedic rehabilitation division s results include three months of operations from empi  following our acquisition on october  the orthopedic rehabilitation division had sales of million in compared to million in  representing a increase for the division 
comparable year over year sales  exclusive of the effect of the empi acquisition  benefited from increased penetration in international markets  the introduction of new products and patient care product line sales initiatives 
specifically our vitalstim product line and our new electrotherapy products are making an impact on both domestic and international sales 
the orthopedic rehabilitation division s international sales increased for over  primarily as a result of the empi acquisition 
sales of new products  which have been on the market less than one year  accounted for million  or of the growth from last year s sales of million 
this compares to new product sales of million in gross margin 
our overall gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased four percentage points to in from in this increase was primarily attributable to the improved gross margin in the orthopedic rehabilitation division  which was primarily attributable to empi product sales that  on average  carry a higher gross margin as a percentage of net sales  than the other products in this division  and continued growth in our higher margin electrotherapy and dysphagia product lines 
the surgical implant division s gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in due largely to approximately million of expenses in the fourth quarter of  which were primarily related to the write off of our trauma product line inventory 
this was based on our strategic decision to focus our surgical implant division business on our growing knee  hip and shoulder product lines  along with our spinal product line  which was recently strengthened by the strategic acquisition of oti 
in addition  both divisions continued their efforts to increase the sales mix in favor of higher margin products  increase the volume of sales and reduce manufacturing costs 
selling  general and administrative 
our selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to in from in higher commissions and royalties associated with increased sales from both of our divisions and the addition of empi selling  general and administrative expenses comprise the majority of this increase 
we also incurred greater expenses for vitalstim marketing efforts and for corporate governance and compliance initiatives resulting from the sarbanes oxley act of in addition  we incurred approximately million of additional expenses recognized in the third quarter of  which included  associated with the termination of our proposed acquisition of biohorizons implant systems  inc biohorizons and  of past royalty and litigation 
table of contents settlement expenses relating to intellectual property used in a portion of our hip implant product line 
finally  amortization expense increased  due primarily to the additional amortization related to the intangible assets acquired from empi 
research and development 
our research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  although there was an increase in the total dollars spent for research and development activities  which was largely due to the acquisition of empi  as a percentage of net sales  research and development costs are approximately for both the years ended december  and december  empi has historically spent fewer dollars on research and development activities than we have 
as a result  the inclusion of empi s results in the fourth quarter has offset our increased expenditures in to develop new product designs and improve quality systems in our surgical implant division 
we expect to expand our new product design initiatives related to our new products acquired in the empi acquisition as we move forward 
operating income 
our operating income increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase is primarily due to continued growth in both our surgical implant division and our orthopedic rehabilitation division  which also benefited from the impact of the acquisition of empi 
additionally  there was an increase in sales of our ongoing product lines and an improvement in both gross and operating margin percentages 
interest expense 
our interest expense increased million to million in from million in at the beginning of the fourth quarter of  million of debt was issued to finance the empi acquisition 
during the fourth quarter  interest expense was million 
interest expense in includes interest on approximately million of debt through august when the debt was repaid with proceeds from a common stock offering 
net income 
we achieved net income for the year of million compared to net loss of million in the prior year result includes a charge of million relating to our early extinguishment of debt in august without this charge  we would have had adjusted income of million 
therefore  on a comparable basis  our net income increased in over the adjusted level 
refer to the adjusted income on page year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our net sales for the year ended december  were million compared to million in  an increase of 
increases were achieved in both the surgical implant and orthopedic rehabilitation divisions  which contributed and of total net sales  respectively 
the following table sets forth the sales geographic mix for each of our divisions 
the amounts shown for the orthopedic rehabilitation division include the six week period prior to our february  acquisition of chattanooga group  inc so as to make the comparisons more meaningful 
in thousands  except domestic international total growth growth growth surgical implant division orthopedic rehabilitation division total we continued to increase our market penetration in domestic surgical implant sales as we continued to build our united states sales force for reconstruction and spinal products 
in the surgical implant division we had sales of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
domestic surgical implant division sales for grew more than to million compared to million in the year over year growth rate in this division increased in each quarter  from flat in the first quarter when compared to the first quarter of  to in the second quarter  in the third quarter  and in the fourth quarter 
the primary contributor to improved domestic sales performance in this division was the increase in the number and quality of sales representatives selling our product 
international sales also improved over the prior year to million in from million in more than two thirds of this increase was attributed to increased purchases from our largest international distributor in japan 
the remaining increase was the result of adding new distributors outside the us in new territories 

table of contents in the orthopedic rehabilitation division  the results include a full year of chattanooga group operations as opposed to eleven months in the orthopedic rehabilitation division had sales of million in compared to sales during of million  representing a increase for the division 
the orthopedic rehabilitation division s results represent a growth rate of approximately compared to when the division had total revenue of million including the six week period prior to our february  acquisition of chattanooga group  inc 
including the pre acquisition period of  the orthopedic rehabilitation division s domestic sales increased for over while international sales increased for over this division s growth was primarily due to the introduction of new products and increased penetration in international markets 
gross margin 
our gross margin as a percentage of net sales grew percentage points to in from in this increase was primarily due to favorable product mix resulting from increased sales in the surgical implant division which had the highest gross margins of our divisions  increased sales of new products with higher margins and continued efforts to improve manufacturing costs 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales improved for both divisions in over the surgical implant division s gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in due largely to sales mix in favor of new products that yield higher margins and efforts to reduce manufacturing costs 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales for the orthopedic rehabilitation division increased percentage points to for the year ended december  due to lower manufacturing costs and the launch of several new  higher margin products 
selling  general and administrative 
in absolute dollar terms  selling  general  and administrative expenses increased for the year  to million in from million in however  as a percentage of net sales  selling  general  and administrative expenses declined to in from in the reduction of selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales is due to continued cost reduction efforts  including  but not limited to  controlling warehouse and distribution costs  which declined by almost  or year over year 
as a result of increased sales and new agent relationships  commissions and royalties expense increased by approximately million primarily due to increased sales in both divisions 
selling and marketing expense increased by a total of million  in line with the increase in sales and related activities in both divisions and sales force reorganization activities in the orthopedic rehabilitation division 
we incurred significant costs related to compliance with new requirements for corporate governance and reporting as a result of the sarbanes oxley act of most of the remaining increase for selling  general  and administrative expenses was due to the inclusion of a full year of chattanooga group expenses compared to a shortened period in the acquisition year of  and increased payroll costs related to performance incentives 
research and development 
our research and development expenses increased to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  this dollar increase of was primarily due to expanded efforts to develop new products across all divisions including the keramos ceramic on ceramic acetabular hip replacement  the reverse shoulder prosthesis for use in shoulder implants  the dknee system  the cyclone anterior cervical plate and three electrotherapy products the intelect legend xt  vectra genisys and intelect transport 
operating income 
our operating income increased million  or  to million in from million in improved sales and margin drove this improvement in our operating results 
interest expense 
our interest expense declined million to million in from million in this was the result of the elimination of a significant portion of our long term debt by the end of the third quarter of during the fourth quarter  interest expense was  during the third quarter  we completed a public offering of common stock raising gross proceeds of million 
the net proceeds of this offering were used to pay approximately million of outstanding debt 
early extinguishment of debt 
we recorded approximately million of expenses in the third quarter of due to the early repayment of our outstanding debt using proceeds from the equity offering completed in august 
amortization of warrant and debt issue costs from the beginning of the year through the debt extinguishment date which totaled million were included as part of interest expense 
all but approximately  of the million charge represented a non cash expense for unamortized warrant and debt issue costs 
net income loss 
we recorded a net loss for the year of million compared to net income of  in excluding the charges for early extinguishment of debt  net income would have been million 
the following table  which has been presented on a non gaap basis  has been provided to reconcile our net loss for the twelve month period ended december  to adjusted income for that same period 
the adjusted income excludes the impact of the expensing of prepayment penalties and unamortized warrant and debt issue costs associated with 
table of contents the early extinguishment of debt during the third quarter of of which only  was cash 
the adjusted income has been included as it is deemed to provide meaningful information regarding the period s performance excluding the additional expense associated with the early debt extinguishment  which is a non recurring transaction that we consummated upon the closing of the million offering of our common stock in august the following should be read in conjunction with our actual financial results presented above  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
year ended reconciliation of adjusted income in thousands loss before income taxes  as reported warrant expense  unamortized debt issues costs and prepayment penalties expensed in connection with early payment of debt income before income taxes  as adjusted provision for income taxes income  as adjusted critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates estimates  including those related to inventory  revenue recognition  deferred taxes  goodwill and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent that actual events differ from our estimates and assumptions  there could be a material impact to our financial statements 
inventory reserves the nature of our business requires us to maintain sufficient inventory on hand at all times to meet the requirements of our customers 
we record inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost based upon average actual cost 
we maintain inventory reserves for such issues as slow moving or excess inventory  product obsolescence and declines in valuation 
in each division we use a specific identification methodology  which can occur whenever there is a change in strategy 
in addition  we review sales performance on at least a quarterly basis to determine the amounts that we should add to the existing reserve 
we monitor reserves on a quarterly basis and make changes as determined by the processes referred to above 
to determine the adequacy of our reserves at each reporting date we analyze the following  among other factors current inventory quantities on hand  product acceptance in the marketplace  customer demand  historical sales  forecasted sales  product obsolescence  and technological innovations 
if there is a material change due to the factors listed above  the current level of the reserve for inventory may not be adequate and would result in our increasing the reserve level 
any modifications to our estimates of our reserves are reflected in cost of sales within the statement of operations  during the period in which such modifications are determined necessary by management 
our surgical implant division products are sold in the united states at the time the product is used in a surgical procedure 
as such  we must maintain sufficient quantities of our products at many locations throughout the country 
this requires a large amount of inventory to be on hand for each surgical implant division product we sell 
it also increases the sensitivity of this line of business to obsolescence reserve estimates 

table of contents the orthopedic rehabilitation division also consigns a portion of inventory to clinics and other healthcare provider locations to allow its products to be immediately dispensed to patients 
since this inventory is not in our possession  we reserve for those devices that are not accounted for during periodic inventory counts conducted by our sales representatives 
the reserve is based on historical trends 
revenue recognition our surgical implant division products are sold through a network of independent sales representatives in the united states  as well as distributors outside the united states 
we record revenues from sales made by sales representatives  who are paid commissions upon the ultimate sale of the products  at the time the product is used in a surgical procedure implanted in a patient and a purchase order is received from the hospital 
we record revenues from sales to customers outside the united states at the time the product is shipped to the distributor 
our international distributors  who sell the products to their customers  take title to the products  have no rights of return and assume the risk for credit and obsolescence 
distributors are obligated to pay us within specified terms  regardless of when they sell the products 
in addition  there is no price protection available to distributors 
we sell our orthopedic rehabilitation division products through a variety of distribution channels 
we sell our clinical rehabilitation products to dealers 
we sell our soft goods products to distributors  retail outlets and various medical and sports establishments 
for both of these channels  we record sales at the time the product is shipped to the customer 
customers take title to the products  assume credit and product obsolescence risks  must pay within specified periods regardless of when they sell or use the products and have no price protection except for distributors who participate in our rebate program 
for our home therapy products  we recognize wholesale revenue when we ship our products to our wholesale customers 
we recognize retail revenue  both rental and purchase  when our product has been dispensed to the patient and the patient s insurance has been verified 
for retail products that are sold from our inventories consigned at clinic locations  we recognize revenue when we receive notice that the device has been prescribed and dispensed to the patient and the insurance has been verified or preauthorization from the insurance company has been obtained  when required 
reserves for sales allowances  product returns  rebates and rental credits 
we have established reserves to account for sales allowances  rebates  product returns and rental credits 
significant management judgment must be used and estimates made in connection with establishing the sales returns  rebates and other allowances in any accounting period 
the reserves for sales allowances and rebates account for sales of our products below the invoice price 
such sales generally result from agreements that we enter into with certain customers that permit them to pay us for our products in amounts that are below the invoice price of the product 
we estimate the amount of the reduction based on historical experience and invoices generated in the period in question 
we consider the impact of new contract terms or modifications of existing arrangements with our customers 
the reserve for product returns accounts for customer returns of our products after purchase 
these returns are mainly attributable to a third party payor s refusal to provide a patient release or reimbursement for the product or the inability of the product to adequately address the patient s condition 
this reserve is provided for by reducing gross revenue by an amount based on our historical rate of returns 
our reserve for rental credit recognizes a timing difference between billing of a purchase and processing of a rental credit associated with some of our electrotherapy devices 
many insurance providers require patients to rent our rehabilitation devices for a period of one to three months prior to purchase 
if the patient has a long term need for the device  these insurance companies may authorize purchase of the device after such time period 
when the device is purchased  most providers require that rental payments previously made on the device be credited toward the purchase price 
these credits are processed at the time the payment is received for the purchase of the device  which creates a time lag between billing of the purchase and processing of the rental credit 
our rental credit reserve accounts for unprocessed rental credits based on the number of devices converted to purchase 
the reserve is calculated by first assessing the number of our products being rented during the relevant period and our historical conversion rate of rentals to sales  and then reducing our revenue by the applicable amount 
the cost to refurbish rented products is expensed as incurred as part of cost of sales 
reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable 
in addition to the reserves for sales allowances  rebates  returns and rental credits  we have also established a reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable 
these uncollectible accounts are a result of nonpayment from our customers and patients 
the reserve is based on historical trends and current relationships with our customers and providers 

table of contents deferred tax asset valuation allowance in assessing the potential realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon whether we attain future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
based upon management s projections of future taxable income  and the periods and manner in which our deferred tax assets will be available  management estimates that it is more likely than not that all of our deferred tax assets will be available to offset future taxable income 
as such  no valuation allowance has been provided against the deferred tax asset balance 
our gross deferred tax asset balance is approximately million at december  and primarily relates to inventory and other reserves  accrued compensation and a net operating loss carry forward 
based on our current projections  we estimate that we will utilize these deferred tax items in future years before expiration 
goodwill and intangible assets we must make estimates related to the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination or asset acquisition  as well as the ongoing measurement of the useful life and value of intangible assets and goodwill 
with respect to valuations of intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination or asset acquisition  we use external third party evaluations in determining the respective fair values and relative allocations of acquisition cost to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred which may affect the estimated useful life  or the recoverability of the remaining balances of our goodwill and other intangible assets 
if such events or circumstances were to indicate that the carrying amount of those assets would not be recoverable  we would estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment is subjective and requires management to exercise judgment in making assumptions related to future cash flows and discount rates 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges were less than the carrying amount of goodwill and other long lived assets  we would recognize an impairment loss 
goodwill was tested for impairment during the fourth quarters of and for both years  we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill 
at december   we have goodwill and intangible assets as follows in thousands goodwill intangibles  net surgical implant division orthopedic rehabilitation division total recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas  inventory costs 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no

the new standard will become effective for us in the third quarter of we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas r and the impact it will have on our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents significant demands inventory the nature of our business requires us to maintain sufficient inventory on hand at all times to meet the requirements of our customers 
throughout our history  our largest demand for capital has come from inventory 
our surgical implant division must maintain sufficient quantities and a complete array of sizes of our products in consigned locations throughout the country for surgeries to be performed on a daily and timely basis 
our orthopedic rehabilitation division also maintains inventory consignment for its at home therapy products 
in addition  all of our divisions must have sufficient quantities on hand to supply their dealers and distributors with product within a reasonable timeframe based on market needs 
capital expenditures the following table summarizes our capital expenditures during the indicated periods in thousands buildings and leasehold improvements equipment software furniture and fixtures surgical implant instrumentation total we have made significant investments in the surgical implant instrumentation required to implant our surgical products 
the size of our investment in this instrumentation has increased due to the increasing size of our sales force and the expansion of our product lines 
consistent with industry practice  we provide surgeons with the implant instruments necessary to implant the device surgically 
following surgery  the instruments are returned to our agents or us  and the hospital pays us for any products used in the surgery 
in the united states  we capitalize and depreciate the surgical implant instrumentation we utilize in support of our domestic sales force  whereas the instruments are sold to our international customers 
the depreciation associated with the surgical implant instrumentation is accounted for as a selling expense and is included as part of total selling  general and administrative expenses 
we have invested in various machine tools in order to increase our manufacturing capacity 
we primarily acquire our machinery through capital leases or acquisitions 
additionally  we have devoted significant capital resources to expanding and improving our information systems through the addition of computer hardware and software  and various other related equipment required to support a growing organization 
we acquired million of property and equipment in connection with the acquisition of empi in additionally  we acquired million in property and equipment related to our acquisition of the chattanooga group in research and development our industry is characterized by continual technological improvement 
our customers demand innovation for a variety of reasons including increased range of motion  faster recovery periods  ease of use and longer product life span among other things 
in response to this demand  we have continued to invest in research and development efforts to benefit both of our divisions 
our product enhancements and new product development processes typically require fda and international regulatory agency approval 
as such  we must invest significant time and resources in order to meet our customers expectations 
we committed of net sales during  during and during to our research and development efforts and we expect to maintain or increase this level of commitment as we continue to grow 
in  the surgical implant division continued the rollout of the dknee  which continues to fuel the growth in knee sales 
the dknee was introduced in germany and the middle east this year 
the surgical implant division also continued the rollout of the keramos ceramic hip acetabular cup in  making encore one of only two companies to offer both metal on metal and ceramic on ceramic bearings for total hips in the united states 
additional new product releases in include the epik unicondylar knee  offset head and revision options for the foundation shoulder system  and the rollout of the cyclone anterior cervical plate 
in our orthopedic rehabilitation division  we introduced a new line of electrotherapy products 
with the recently announced food and drug administration k clearance of our new orthopedic therapy laser devices  which we will market as part of our clinical electrotherapy and therapeutic ultrasound 
table of contents product lines  and our ongoing clinical trials involving our mobile bearing knee system and reverse shoulder prosthesis  we continue to build a healthy pipeline of innovative  technologically advanced products 
liquidity and capital resources during the twelve months ended december   our operating activities provided million of cash as compared to million provided for the twelve months ended december   resulting in a net decrease of million 
this decrease in operating cash flow results primarily from increases in our gross accounts receivable and inventory balances which are offset by improved net income  adjusted for non cash items 
our accounts receivable in used cash of million due to increasing sales levels while in accounts receivable used cash of million 
these differences resulted in a decline in operating cash flow of million from during  our inventory used cash of million  whereas in increases in our inventory used cash of million 
this results in a decline in operating cash flow of million from additionally  our accounts payable and accrued liabilities in used cash of million  as opposed to when increases in payables and accrued liabilities provided cash of million 
this resulted in a decrease in cash flow of million from year to year 
these declines in operating cash flow were offset by an improvement in our net income  adjusted for non cash items 
net income  adjusted for non cash items  provided million in operating cash flow during  an increase of million from the million provided in investing activities used million of cash for the twelve months ended december  compared to million of cash for the twelve months ended december  this increase is primarily due to the purchase of empi during  which utilized million of cash 
capital expenditures used an additional million in over the capital expenditure outlays in a significant portion of our ongoing capital expenditures related to instrument sets required by our surgical implant division to service the additional sales and the growth in the domestic sales force 
we also invested in machine tools in order to increase our manufacturing capacity and in hardware and software to improve our information systems both of which are necessary to support a growing organization 
additionally  we used  of cash to purchase a license to manufacture and sell products utilizing a patented implant design and mechanism and to purchase the rights to manufacture a new laser therapy device 
the conversion of our invested cash from securities with maturities greater than three months into cash resulted in a million source of cash from investing activities 
cash provided by financing activities in the twelve months of increased by million to million when compared to  when cash provided by financing activities was million 
this increase is primarily the result of capital raising activities to support our acquisition strategy 
proceeds from the net issuance of our long term debt were million in this compared to when net payments on long term debt were million 
in  we received million in net proceeds from issuance of common stock principally related to the exercise of stock options 
in we received million in net proceeds from common stock issuances primarily from the two separate offerings of our common stock for a total of million shares providing net proceeds of million 
the remaining net proceeds from common stock were from the exercise of warrants and options 
in addition  in  we received million in additional proceeds from short swing profits related to the completion of our public offering of six million shares of our common stock in december since our inception  we have financed our operations through the sale of equity securities  borrowings and cash flow from operations 
we believe there is sufficient liquidity to fund current operations and contingencies 
on october   we entered into a new senior credit facility with a syndicate of banks  financial institutions and other institutional lenders led by bank of america  na  that provides for aggregate borrowings of up to million  comprised of a five year million revolving credit facility  and a six year million term loan facility the credit facility 
proceeds from the term loan facility were used to finance the cash portion of our purchase of empi 
the revolving credit facility is available to be used for general corporate purposes  subject to certain limitations 
as of december   we had not borrowed any of this available amount 
we executed various security documents  and we pledged all of our domestic assets and of the equity holdings of our foreign subsidiary to the lenders to secure the financing under the credit facility 
the interest rate under the credit facility is dependent on  among other things  our total debt to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ratio 
based on that ratio as of december   our interest rate is equal to bank of america s base rate plus  or the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
in february  we borrowed funds from our existing line of credit to finance the million cash purchase price of a new acquisition 
there are potential future milestone payments of million related to this acquisition based upon the performance of the acquired product lines 
beginning march   the term loan facility is payable in quarterly installments of principal of a million  for each of the first quarterly periods  b million  for each of the next eight quarterly periods  and c million  for each of the last four quarterly periods  with the last payment due in october additionally  on october   we sold million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the notes to institutional investors at a purchase price of of the principal amount of the notes 
interest on the notes accrues at the rate of per annum and is payable semi annually on april and october  beginning on april  the lender s rights under the notes are junior and subordinate to the rights of the various lenders and the security interests created by the security documents executed pursuant to the credit facility 

table of contents these debt arrangements contain operating and financial agreements and restrictions  which may restrict our business and financing activities 
these debt agreements restrict our ability to i incur additional indebtedness  ii issue redeemable equity interests and preferred equity interests  iii pay dividends or make distributions  repurchase equity interests or make other restricted payments  iv make capital expenditures  v create liens  vi enter into transactions with our affiliates  vii make investments  viii sell assets  or ix enter into mergers or consolidations 
the debt agreements also require us to meet certain financial tests 
as of the date of this report  we are in compliance with all debt covenants and warranties 
on august   we sold  shares of our common stock for per share in a public offering 
this offering generated total gross proceeds of approximately million and we used the net proceeds of approximately million to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness under our senior subordinated notes payable to capitalsource finance llc and our outstanding indebtedness under our previous bank of america credit facility 
on december   we sold an additional  shares of our common stock for per share in a public offering 
this offering generated total gross proceeds of approximately million and we used the net proceeds of approximately million as a portion of the consideration for the recent empi acquisition 
we believe that our existing cash  plus the amounts we expect to generate from operations and amounts available through our existing million revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our operating needs for the next twelve months  including working capital requirements  capital expenditures  debt repayment obligations and potentially smaller product acquisitions 
while we currently believe that we will be able to meet all of our financial covenants imposed by our credit agreements  there is no assurance that we will in fact be able to do so or that we will be able to obtain a waiver of default or amendments to our credit agreements in the future 
we continue to expand our business through selected acquisitions of businesses or products in the orthopedic industry 
we have completed four acquisitions since that have allowed us to extend our business in the orthopedic market to include rehabilitation equipment 
we have a history of raising capital through a combination of debt and equity offerings to finance these acquisitions 
as additional financing needs arise  we will consider sources of financing to include a combination of debt or equity 
we may issue debt or equity in anticipation of future financing needs  to position our capital structure towards a certain debt to equity range or to replace existing borrowing agreements 
in addition to the current restrictions and requirements contained in our current loan and credit agreements  the maximum amounts allowable to borrow under our current credit facilities could limit our flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities 
this potential high degree of leverage could have negative consequences for us  including the following i our ability to obtain additional financing  if necessary  for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or financing may not be available to us on favorable terms  ii we would need a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness  including indebtedness that we may incur in the future  iii payments on our indebtedness would reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities  iv a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows could make it difficult for us to meet our debt service requirements and force us to modify our operations  v our debt level could make us more vulnerable than our competitors to a downturn in either our business or the economy generally  and vi because some of our debt has a variable rate of interest  it would expose us to the risk of increased interest rates

these forward looking statements are further qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  primarily risks from changing interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
our primary exposure is to changing interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our credit facility  which bears interest at floating rates based on the london interbank offering rate libor or the prime rate plus an applicable borrowing margin 
our outstanding balance under this agreement was million as of december  we manage our interest rate risk by balancing the amount of fixed and variable debt 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the market value  but do not impact earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value  but do impact future earnings and cash flow  assuming other factors are held constant 
our million credit facility is based on variable interest rates 
as of december   utilizing a hedging strategy  we have swapped variable rates for fixed rates on million of the borrowing under the credit facility thereby locking in a fixed rate on this portion of the principal 
all of our other debt is fixed rate debt 
we may use additional derivative financial instruments where appropriate to manage our interest rate risk 
however  as a matter of policy  we do not enter into derivative or other financial investments for trading or speculative purposes 
over the past year  in particular with the empi acquisition  we have begun to directly distribute our orthopedic rehabilitation division products in selected foreign markets  and some of the sales of our products in european markets are denominated in euros  which would cause currency fluctuations to more directly impact our operating results 
for example  in periods in which the euro strengthens against the us dollar  our international net revenues increase because our euro denominated net revenues will translate into a greater number of us dollars 
conversely  in periods in which the euro weakens against the us dollar  our international revenues decrease because our euro denominated net revenues will translate into fewer us dollars 
during the fourth quarter of  our average monthly euro sales approximated million 
this fourth quarter amount is more indicative of our future international operations following the purchase of empi s international operations 
our german subsidiary  whose functional currency is euros  is billed for certain inventory in us dollars 
our us operations are subject to risk associated with international currency exchange rates on purchases of inventory from a small number of suppliers 
our german subsidiary currently utilizes international currency derivatives to limit its risk to currency fluctuations 
these derivatives are in the form of forward currency contracts used to manage currency fluctuation on purchases of inventory that are denominated in us dollars 
to date  we have not used international currency derivatives to hedge against our investment in our german subsidiary or its operating results  which are converted into us dollars at period end and average rates  respectively
