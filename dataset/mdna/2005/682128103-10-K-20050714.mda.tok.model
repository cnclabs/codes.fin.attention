overview we design  develop and market high performance  highly integrated and cost efficient semiconductor image sensor devices 
our main products  image sensing devices we refer to by the name camerachip  are used to capture an image electronically and are used in a number of consumer and commercial mass market applications 
our camerachips are designed to use the cmos fabrication process 
we have designed the majority of our camerachip as single chip solutions that integrate several distinct functions including image capture  image processing  color processing  signal conversion and output of a fully processed image or video stream 
we believe that our highly integrated camerachips enable camera device manufacturers to build high quality camera products that are smaller  less complex  more reliable  lower cost and more power efficient than cameras using either traditional ccds or multiple chip cmos image sensors 
in august  we announced the introduction of our advanced omnipixel technology 
omnipixel technology represents a global redesign that features new pixel architecture  new circuit design  new embedded algorithms  new materials and new process technology 
omnipixel technology also includes support for features such as auto focus  zooming  panning and mechanical shutter control 
in september  we introduced our first small scale  cmos image sensor with five megapixels 
the megapixel sensor s new architecture is based on our omnipixel technology 
the sensor s micron pixels allowed us to design a megapixel device with an optical format footprint of just inches  making the new five megapixel sensor small enough to meet the increasing demand for smaller  low cost cameras with high performance 
in november  we announced that we were shipping samples of our latest megapixel omnipixel image sensor to leading manufacturers of camera cell phones 
we now offer a complete line of sensors from vga to megapixels that use our omnipixel technology 
in february  we announced the introduction of the first smart sensor image sensor  the ov  that is capable of storing and subsequently identifying unique images for applications such as character recognition and facial recognition 
the target market for the ov is mass market smart toys 
our image sensor products are sold to customers who incorporate them in either digital or analog mass market products 
digital mass market products that currently incorporate our image sensor products include camera cell phones  digital still and video cameras 
analog products that currently incorporate our image sensor products include security and surveillance products and interactive video game and toy cameras 
we sell our products worldwide directly to oems  which include branded customers and contract manufacturers  and vars  and indirectly through distributors 
we currently outsource the wafer fabrication  color filter application and packaging of our image sensor products 
this approach allows us to focus our resources on the design  development and marketing of our products and significantly reduces our capital requirements 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued during fiscal and early fiscal  we relocated a substantial portion of our automated image testing equipment from the united states to china 
we expect to expand our testing capabilities with additional automated testing equipment  which will also be located in china 
in october  we entered into a shareholders agreement  or the visera agreement  with tsmc  pursuant to which we agreed with tsmc to form visera technology company  or visera  a joint venture in taiwan 
visera s mission is to provide manufacturing services and automated final testing services 
in connection with the formation of visera  tsmc and we have separately entered into nonexclusive license agreements with visera pursuant to which both parties will license certain intellectual property to visera relating to manufacturing services and automated final testing services 
once visera has the capability to deliver high quality manufacturing services and automated final testing services  we are committed to direct a substantial portion of our requirements in these areas to visera  subject to pricing and technology requirements 
tsmc and we have also committed not to compete directly or indirectly with visera in the provision of certain manufacturing services and automated final testing services 
historically  we have relied upon tsmc to provide us with a substantial proportion of our wafers 
as a part of the visera agreement  tsmc has agreed to commit substantial wafer manufacturing capacity to us in exchange for our commitment to purchase a substantial portion of our wafers from tsmc  subject to pricing and technology requirements 
in may  we entered into an agreement with powerchip semiconductor corporation  or psc  to establish a joint venture in taiwan 
the purpose of the joint venture  which is called silicon optronics  inc  or soi  is to conduct manufacturing  marketing and selling of certain of our legacy products 
in connection with the establishment of soi  we have agreed to enter into manufacturing and other agreements as appropriate with psc 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we assumed control of the board of directors of soi and as of april   consolidated soi into our financial statements for the first time 
in april  we completed our acquisition of privately held cdm optics  inc  or cdm  and cdm became a wholly owned subsidiary of omnivision 
cdm is located in boulder  colorado 
cdm is the exclusive licensee from an affiliate of the university of colorado of a patented technology  known as wavefront coding  which substantially increases the performance of an imaging system by increasing the depth of field and or correcting optical aberrations within the image 
in transforming the task of focusing a lens from an opto mechanical process to one of optical encoding and signal processing  wavefront coding is expected to significantly reduce the size and complexity of the auto focus function on future camera modules utilizing our sensors 
the closing consideration consisted of million in cash and approximately  shares of our common stock 
we are obligated to pay an additional million in cash upon the sale of a pre determined number of revenue producing products incorporating cdm s technology 
cdm and the costs associated with the acquisition are included in our consolidated balance sheets at april  as of april   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately million in short term investments 
to mitigate market risk related to short term investments  we have an investment policy designed to preserve the value of capital and to generate interest income from these investments without material exposure to market fluctuations 
market risk is the potential loss due to the change in value of a financial instrument as a result of changes in interest rates or bond prices 
our policy is to invest in financial instruments with short durations  limiting interest rate exposure  and to measure performance against comparable benchmarks 
we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations with ratings of a or better and money market funds 
the current economic environment we operate in a challenging economic environment that has undergone significant changes in technology and in patterns of global trade 
we strive to remain a leader in the development and marketing of image sensing devices based on the cmos fabrication process and have benefited from the growing market demand for and acceptance of this technology 
the shift in global fabrication to asia has introduced a range of cost pressures on domestic manufacturers 
in response to these pressures  and in order to be closer to our primary customer base and our 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued sources of offshore fabrication  we relocated a substantial portion of our testing operations to china 
since our inception  we have shipped more than million image sensors  including approximately million in fiscal  which demonstrated the capabilities of our production system  including our sources of offshore fabrication 
to enhance our production capabilities  we have initiated partnerships with a number of vendors  including tsmc  one of the largest wafer fabrication companies in the world 
since we generate a large portion of our product sales through vars and distributors  we cannot accurately confirm the distribution of our revenues across specific product categories and can only estimate our revenues by market segment 
we benefited from growth in shipments for camera cell phones on a year over year basis  driven by increased demand for our megapixel image sensors 
our estimated sales to the digital still camera market reflected an increase in the three months ended april  from the levels achieved in the previous quarter as a result  in part  of the introduction of a new megapixel chip based on our recently announced omnipixel technology 
the digital still camera market demonstrates a continuing trend toward higher resolution products  with a growing acceptance of cmos image sensors 
we have continued to address this trend through the development and introduction of higher resolution products 
in anticipation of this market trend  we developed and introduced in september our first small scale  cmos image sensor with five megapixels 
the megapixel sensor s new architecture is based on our omnipixel technology 
in february  we announced eight design wins for this product representing the first uses of a megapixel cmos image sensor to process both still and video images in mass market consumer devices 
concurrent with the transition to higher resolution products  we have seen increased competition in the megapixel market with resulting pressures on product pricing 
we believe that excess capacity on the part of ccd manufacturers continues to contribute to aggressive price reductions in the megapixel product category 
we believe the market opportunity represented by camera cell phones remains very large 
we also believe that  like the digital still camera market  camera cell phone demand will continue to shift toward higher resolutions 
in february  we released our quarter inch megapixel image sensor designed specifically for camera cell phones and are currently in mass production with this product 
the fourth quarter of fiscal marked the first time that megapixel unit shipments exceeded vga unit shipments  and we expect the trend to higher resolutions to continue 
we also believe that vga resolution sensors will continue to account for a large portion of the volume shipments in handsets for the remainder of calendar the digital sensor market also demonstrates a trend toward increasingly sophisticated optical applications 
in february  we introduced the first low cost optical recognition sensor designed specifically for the consumer toy market 
toys that incorporate this technology are able to recognize  learn and recall patterns and human faces and react accordingly 
however  we believe this low cost optical recognition sensor  which permits such applications as facial recognition  motion tracking and pattern recognition  will facilitate the development of many affordable smart toys for mass market introduction by christmas as the markets for image sensors have grown  we have experienced increased competition from manufacturers of cmos and ccd image sensors 
in particular  we have experienced increased competition from companies such as magna chip  micron and sony in the market for cmos image sensors 
in addition  we expect to see continued price competition in the image sensor market for mobile phones and digital cameras as those markets continue to grow 
although we believe that we currently compete effectively in those markets  our competitive position could be impaired by companies that have greater financial  technical  marketing  manufacturing and distribution resources  broader product lines  better access to large customer bases  greater name recognition  longer operating histories and more established strategic and financial relationships than we do 
such companies may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
as a result of the increase in competition and the growth of various consumer product applications for image sensors  we have experienced a shortening in the life cycle of some image sensor products 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued for example  although in the security and surveillance market we continue to sell image sensors introduced more than four years ago  in the camera cell phone market  product life cycles can be as short as six months 
with the shortening of product life cycles  it will be increasingly difficult to accurately forecast customer demand for our products 
as a result  we face the risk of being unable to fulfill customer orders if we underestimate market demand and the risks of excess inventory and product obsolescence if we overestimate market demand for our products 
the shortening of product life cycles also increases the importance of having short product development cycles and being accurate in the prediction of market trends in the design of new products 
many of the products using our camerachip and omnipixel image sensors are consumer electronics goods that have particular seasonal cycles such as camera cell phones  digital still and video cameras and cameras for toys and games 
historically  demand from oems and distributors that serve such consumer product markets has been stronger in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year and weaker in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year 
in august  we announced the introduction of our advanced omnipixel technology 
in september  we introduced our first small scale  cmos image sensor with five megapixels based on our new omnipixel technology 
in february  we introduced our new smart sensor image sensor technology 
certain risks are inherent in the introduction of such new products and technology 
during the early stages of production  the production yields and gross margins for new products are typically lower than those of established products 
in addition  in preparation for new product introductions  we gradually ramp down production of established products 
with our week production cycle  it is extremely difficult to predict precisely how many units of established products we will need 
it is also difficult to accurately predict the speed of the ramp of new products 
as a result  it is possible that we could suffer from shortages for certain products and build inventories in excess of demand for other products 
sources of revenues we generate almost all our revenue by selling our products directly to oems and vars and indirectly through distributors 
we treat sales to oems and vars as one source of revenue  and distributors as another 
our revenue recognition policies for the two groups are different 
see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition below for additional information regarding recognition of revenue 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an ongoing basis we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes  litigation and contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and material effects on our operating results and financial position may result 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our estimates reflect the following critical accounting policies revenue recognition we generate our revenue by selling our products to oems  vars and distributors 
for shipments to oems  vars and distributors without agreements that allow for returns or credits  we recognize revenue using the sell in method 
under this method  we recognize revenue when title passes to the customer provided that we have received a signed purchase order  the price is fixed or determinable  title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer  collection of resulting receivables is considered reasonably assured  product returns are reasonably estimable  there are no customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued material obligations 
we provide for future returns based on historical experience at the time we recognize revenue 
for shipments to distributors under agreements allowing for returns or credits  we recognize revenue using the sell through method under which we defer revenue until the distributor resells the product to its customer and notifies us in writing of such sale 
deferred income on shipments to distributors represents the amount billed less the cost of inventory shipped to but not yet sold by distributors 
see allowance for doubtful accounts and sales return reserve below for additional information regarding sales return reserves 
in addition  we recognize a minimal amount of revenue when we provide engineering assistance to certain of our customers 
we recognize the associated revenue only upon the completion of  and acceptance by  the customer of the services performed 
the revenue is based on a fixed fee  which is agreed upon prior to initiation of the engineering assistance 
historically  revenue generated from such arrangements has been immaterial 
in order to determine whether collection is probable  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer the recognition of revenue until collection becomes reasonably assured or upon receipt of payment 
allowance for doubtful accounts we undertake credit evaluations for all major sale transactions before we release product for shipment 
normal payment terms apply upon transfer of risk of loss 
on an ongoing basis  we analyze the payment history of customer accounts  including recent customer purchases 
we evaluate aged items in accounts receivable and provide reserves for doubtful accounts 
customer creditworthiness and economic conditions may change and increase the risk of collectibility and may require additional provisions  which would negatively impact our operating results 
as of april   our allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately of total accounts receivable 
sales return reserve based on historical sales returns and other known factors  we provide for estimated sales returns in the same period we record the related revenues 
the net change in our net sales return reserve balance in fiscal was approximately of revenues  and the reserve was equivalent to of total accounts receivable at april  inventory provisions and effect on gross margin we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on historical usage rates and our forecast of future demand for our products  generally for the coming six months 
because of risk of obsolescence  we will generally provide a reserve for the costs of our inventories in excess of our forecast for the applicable period 
in fiscal  and  we sold certain previously reserved products 
even though we sold the products at a price that was less than our original cost  because the inventory was previously reserved  sales of these products improved our gross margins 
the sale of previously reserved inventory in fiscal had an immaterial effect on gross margin 
we attempt to control our inventory levels so that we do not hold inventories in excess of demand for the succeeding months 
however  because we need to place non cancelable orders with significant lead time and because it is difficult to estimate product demand  it is possible that we will build inventories in excess of demand for future periods 
if we have inventories in excess of estimated product demand  we will provide a reserve  which could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position 
in preparation for new product introductions  we gradually ramp down production of established products  while preparing for production of newer products 
with our week production cycle  it is extremely difficult to predict precisely how many units of established products we need 
it is also difficult to accurately predict the speed of the ramp of new products or the projected life cycles of new products which have continued to shorten in duration 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued under these circumstances  it is possible that we could suffer from shortages for certain products and also build inventories in excess of demand for other products 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of assets useful lives and future cash flows 
when such events occur  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
to date  we have not recognized any impairment loss 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following operating losses  significant negative industry trends  significant underutilization of the assets  and significant changes in how we use the assets or our plans for their use 
accounting for income taxes as of april   we had recorded a valuation allowance of million to offset california tax credit carryovers 
we believe that it is more likely than not that we will not realize these carryovers 
in the future  when the credit is utilized and the valuation allowance is released  million of the tax benefit resulting from the exercise of employee stock options will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity rather than a reduction of the income tax expense in the year such event occurs 
for fiscal  and  the income tax provision reflected an effective tax rate of  and  respectively 
these rates were less than the combined federal and state statutory rate of approximately because of the lower tax rates that prevail in jurisdictions outside the united states  the reversal of the fiscal valuation allowance  certain tax credits and other factors 
we expect that our consolidated effective tax rate will decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal and be less than the combined federal and state statutory rates 
achieving an effective tax rate in fiscal that is less than the combined federal and state statutory rates is principally dependent upon the proportion of our income we earn in jurisdictions outside the united states 
litigation and contingencies from time to time  we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims with respect to such matters as patents and other actions arising out of the normal course of business  as well as other matters identified in legal proceedings in part i  item of this annual report 
our success and future revenue growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies 
we have been issued patents and have a number of pending united states and foreign patent applications 
however  we cannot provide assurance that any patent will be issued as a result of any applications or  if issued  that any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  it is possible that existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
see legal proceedings for a description of the counterclaim ic media brought against us with respect to one of our foreign patents 
it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization  develop corresponding technology independently or design around our patents 
effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued these disputes may result in costly and time consuming litigation or require the license of additional elements of intellectual property for a fee 
it is possible that other companies might pursue litigation with respect to any claims such companies purport to have against us 
the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain 
in the event of an adverse result in any litigation with respect to intellectual property rights relevant to our products that could arise in the future  we could be required to obtain licenses to the infringed technology  pay substantial damages under applicable law  including treble damages if we are held to have willfully infringed  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products or to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology 
litigation frequently involves substantial expenditures and can require significant management attention  even if we ultimately prevail 
given the uncertainties associated with litigation  if our assessments prove to be wrong  or if additional information becomes available such that we estimate that there is a possible loss or possible range of loss associated with these contingencies  then we would record the minimum estimated liability  which could materially impact our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
results of operations the following table sets forth the results of our operations as a percentage of revenues 
our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
fiscal year ended april  revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative stock compensation charge total operating expenses income from operations interest income other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income revenues we derive revenues from the sale of our image sensor products for use in a wide variety of consumer and commercial mass market applications including camera cell phones  digital still cameras  security and surveillance cameras and interactive video and toy cameras 
revenues increased to approximately million for fiscal from million for fiscal revenues increased to approximately million for fiscal from million for fiscal as shown in the table below  these increased revenues are due to an increase in sales of our image sensor products for digital applications  principally camera cell phones and digital still cameras  partially offset by declines in average selling prices 
revenues from sales of image sensor products for digital as compared to analog applications 
our image sensor products are sold to customers who incorporate them into either digital or analog applications 
examples of digital applications that incorporate our image sensor products are camera cell phones  digital still cameras  personal computer camera applications and interactive video and digital toy cameras 
examples of analog applications that incorporate our image sensor products are security and surveillance cameras and analog toy cameras 
we sell a large portion of our products through vars and distributors  and often we do not know 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the product or end use market addressed by the manufacturers who ultimately embed our image sensors into their products 
as a result of our sales to vars and distributors and because our image sensor products can be used in a wide variety of digital or analog products  we cannot accurately confirm the distribution of our revenues across specific product categories 
however  we are able to confirm the distribution of our revenues by digital and analog product categories  and they are as follows in thousands fiscal year ended april  digital applications analog applications total comparison of fiscal and fiscal digital revenues 
revenues from sales of image sensor products for digital applications increased to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenues from sales of image sensor products for digital applications represented and of revenues in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the year over year increase in revenues from sales of image sensor products for digital applications for fiscal was primarily due to an increase in unit sales of approximately million  or  resulting from increased demand for image sensor products used in camera cell phone and digital still camera applications 
we believe that demand in the camera cell phone market during fiscal continued to reflect a continuing shift toward higher resolutions and increased requirements from service providers to include camera functionality in handsets as consumers upgrade their cell phones 
for fiscal  the increase in unit sales was partially offset by a decline in average sales prices resulting from the intensely competitive nature of the image sensor market 
our image sensor products face competition from a number of sources  including companies that sell ccd image sensors  as well as other companies that sell cmos image sensors 
this competition has resulted in rapid technological change  evolving standards  reductions in product sales prices and rapid product obsolescence 
as a result of this highly competitive environment  we expect that average sales prices for digital image sensor products will decline in the future 
analog revenues 
revenues from sales of image sensor products for analog applications increased to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenues from sales of image sensor products for analog applications represented and of revenues in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in revenues from sales of image sensor products for analog applications in fiscal primarily was due to an increase in unit sales of approximately million  or 
the decline in analog revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal resulted from the proportionately greater increase in digital revenues during the period 
image sensor products for analog applications are used primarily in cameras for security applications and toys and games 
the increase in unit sales was partially offset by a decline in average sales prices in fiscal we expect that average sales prices for analog image sensor products will decline in the future 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal digital revenues 
revenues from sales of camerachips for digital applications increased in fiscal from fiscal and represented and of our revenues in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in revenues from sales of camerachips for digital applications in fiscal primarily was due to increases in unit sales of approximately million  or  and was led by increases of approximately million  or  in unit sales of lower resolution camerachips products used primarily in cell phone and toy applications  which carry a lower average sales price than camerachips used for digital still camera applications 
we believe that demand in the cell phone market resulted from increased requirements from service providers to include camera functionality on handsets as consumers upgrade their cell phones 
the increase in revenues from sales of high resolution camerachips used primarily for digital still camera applications also resulted from increases in unit sales of million  or  in fiscal the increase in unit sales was partially offset by a decline in average sales prices during fiscal 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued analog revenues 
revenues from sales of camerachips for analog applications increased in fiscal from fiscal and represented and of our revenues in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
this increase in revenues from sales of camerachips for analog applications in fiscal was due primarily to increases of approximately million  or  in unit sales 
the decline in analog revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal resulted from the proportionately greater increase in digital revenues during the period 
such camerachips for analog applications are used primarily in cameras for toys and games and security applications 
the increase in unit sales was partially offset by a decline in average sales prices in fiscal revenues from sales to oems and vars as compared to distributors we sell our image sensor products either directly to oems and vars or indirectly through distributors 
the following table shows the percentage of revenues from sales to oems and vars and distributors in each of fiscal  and fiscal year ended april  oems and vars distributors total oems and vars 
in fiscal  two oem customers accounted for approximately and our revenues  respectively 
in fiscal  no single oem or var customer accounted for or more of our revenues 
in fiscal  one oem customer accounted for more than approximately of our revenues 
for fiscal  and  no other oem or var customer accounted for or more of our revenues 
distributors 
in fiscal  and  one distributor customer accounted for approximately  and of our revenues  respectively 
for fiscal  and  no other distributor customer accounted for or more of our revenues 
revenues from domestic sales as compared to foreign sales the following table shows the percentage of our revenues derived from sales of our image sensor products to domestic customers as compared to foreign customers in each of fiscal  and fiscal year ended april  domestic sales foreign sales total we derive the majority of our foreign sales from customers in asia and  to a lesser extent  in europe 
over time  our sales to asia pacific customers have increased primarily as a result of the continuing trend of outsourcing the production of consumer electronics products to asian manufacturers and facilities 
because of the preponderance of asia pacific manufacturers and the fact that virtually all products incorporating our image sensor products are sold globally  we believe that such figures do not accurately reflect the geographic distribution of sales of our products into end user markets 
gross profit comparison of fiscal and fiscal gross margin for fiscal and was and of revenues  respectively 
our gross margins in fiscal were favorably impacted by changes in product mix 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our gross margins were also favorably impacted by approximately million of gross profit attributable to the sale of inventory that had been substantially written off in prior fiscal years 
in addition  in the second quarter of fiscal  our gross margins benefited from a million reduction in cost of goods sold arising from the settlement of a dispute related to the late cancellation of an order from one of our customers 
our gross margins in fiscal were adversely affected late in the fiscal year by approximately million as the result of a temporary back end yield issue with one of our products that was unrelated to our underlying image sensor technology 
the yield issue was limited in duration and  during the first quarter of the current fiscal year  the yield has returned to a level close to standard 
our gross margins in fiscal were adversely impacted by approximately million in additional provisions related to the possible replacement of product which did not meet a particular customer s specifications 
for fiscal  approximately million of gross profit was attributable to the sale of previously written off inventory 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal gross margin for fiscal and was and of revenues  respectively 
the increase in gross margin for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower unit costs as a result of improved efficiency in our production sequence 
for fiscal  approximately million of gross profit was attributable to the sale of previously reserved inventory 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and personnel related expenses and costs for purchased materials  designs  tooling  depreciation of computers and workstations  and amortization of computer aided design software 
because we accrue the non recurring engineering costs associated with each new product design when we release the design to the foundry  and the number of new designs can fluctuate from period to period  research and development expense may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
research and development expenses for fiscal  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses for fiscal  and represented  and  respectively 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal the increase in research and development expenses of approximately million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted primarily from a million increase in non recurring engineering expenses related to new product development required to improve our current product line and support new product introductions  a million increase in salary and payroll related expenses associated with additional personnel and a million increase in expenses for software  patent prosecution and engineering supplies 
examples of new product development expenses include tape out and prototype runs with our wafer manufacturers 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses will continue to increase as we develop and introduce new products employing our omnipixel and smart sensor technologies and begin to support the research and development efforts of our recent acquisition  cdm 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal the increase in research and development expenses of approximately million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted primarily from a million increase in non recurring engineering expenses related to new product development required to improve our current product line and support new product introductions  a million increase in salary and payroll related expenses associated with additional personnel and a million increase in expenses for software  patent prosecution and engineering supplies

comparison of fiscal and fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately million  or for fiscal from fiscal resulted primarily from a million increase in legal and accounting expenses resulting from the investigation into  and subsequent restatement of  our financial statements for the first three quarters of fiscal  the costs of the litigation that ensued  and from the work we performed to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley legislation  a million increase in salary and payroll related expenses  a million increase in third party commissions associated with our increased revenues and a million increase in outside service expenses 
the increase was partially offset by a million decrease in provisions for bad debts 
we anticipate that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in the future due to the continued expansion of our organization  including ongoing compliance with sarbanes oxley regulations and the continuing upgrade of our enterprise resource planning  or erp  system 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately million  or  for fiscal from fiscal resulted primarily from a million increase in commissions associated with increased revenues  a million increase in salary and payroll related expenses  a million increase in provisions for bad debts related to the increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for our foreign operations that were primarily engaged in selling activities and a million increase in legal and accounting expenses

interest income for fiscal  and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
increased interest income in fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted from higher balances in interest bearing accounts resulting primarily from cash from operations  and by higher interest rates 
increased interest income for fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted from increased investments in interest bearing accounts resulting from approximately million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in our follow on public offering in july and cash provided by operating activities  partially offset by lower interest rates 
other income loss  net other income loss  net  for fiscal was a loss of million on a net basis and consisted principally of our portion of the losses recorded by one company which we accounted for in fiscal using the equity method of accounting  impac technology co  ltd  partially offset by income recorded by soi another investee company which we accounted for during fiscal using the equity method of accounting 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we assumed control of the board of directors of soi 
on april   soi was consolidated with our financial statements for the first time and will be included in our consolidated operating results in fiscal other income loss  net for fiscal was income of million and consisted primarily of proceeds from the settlement of litigation 
we did not have any other income loss  net in fiscal 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued provision for income taxes we generated approximately million  million and million in income before income taxes for fiscal  and  respectively 
we recorded a provision for income taxes for fiscal  and of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
for fiscal  and  the effective rate was  and  respectively 
these rates were less than the combined federal and state statutory rate of approximately because of certain tax credits and other factors 
the lower effective tax rate for fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the mix of income between domestic and foreign entities for the current fiscal year 
the higher effective tax rate for fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the release of the valuation allowance in fiscal we expect that our consolidated effective tax rate will decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal and will be less than the combined federal and state statutory rates 
achieving an effective tax rate in fiscal that is less than the combined federal and state statutory rates is principally contingent upon the proportion of our total pre tax income that is generated by our foreign affiliates 
on october   the american jobs creation act the ajca was signed into law 
the ajca provides for a deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the ajca  for an effective tax cost of of any such repatriated foreign earnings 
we may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in fiscal we have begun an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision and in particular of the limitation of the deduction to certain qualifying expenses incurred in the united states 
we do not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until late in fiscal when our qualifying expenses for the fiscal year will be known 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity at april  consisted of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
liquidity our working capital increased by approximately million to million as of april  from million as of april  the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in cash and cash equivalents  a million increase in inventories to support future sales and a million increase in accounts receivable  net  consistent with the increase in revenues from prior year levels  a  decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets and a million decrease in restricted cash  these increases were partially offset by a million increase in accrued income taxes payable  a million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities to support increased levels of operations  a million decrease in refundable and deferred income taxes and a  increase in short term investments 
cash flows from operating activities for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million as compared to million for fiscal  primarily due to net income of approximately million for fiscal  adjusted for non cash charges of million in depreciation and amortization and million in tax benefits from stock option exercises  and a million increase in accrued income taxes payable  a million increase in refundable and deferred income taxes and a million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities  partially offset by a million increase in inventories  a million increase in accounts receivable  net  and a million decrease in accounts payable 
the million increase in accounts receivable  net  reflects the higher level of revenues during fiscal  combined with an increase in days of sales outstanding to days as of april  from days as of april  the million increase in inventories was attributable to our expansion of work in process inventories late in the fiscal year in anticipation of increased future sales of our new omnipixel products 
the increase is driven by our to week production cycle and reflects our anticipated increase in sales activity during the first half of fiscal inventory turns decreased to as of april  from as of april   as we increased inventory levels to reduce supply constraints 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million as compared to million for fiscal  primarily due to net income of approximately million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal  a million increase in accounts payable  a million increase in deferred income  a million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities  and a million decrease in refundable and deferred income taxes  which were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable  net  a million increase in inventories to support future sales  and a million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets 
the million increase in accounts receivable  net  reflects the significantly higher level of revenues during fiscal  combined with an increase in days of sales outstanding from days as of april  to days as of april  the increase in accounts receivable  net  was partially offset by a million increase in the reserve for sales returns  which rose as a result of the large increase in revenues for fiscal  and by a million increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts  which rose as a result of the large increase in accounts receivable balances 
the million increase in inventories was attributable to higher inventory levels required to support future sales 
inventory turns  calculated based on the fiscal quarters ended april  and  decreased from as of april  to as of april   as we increased inventory levels to reduce supply constraints 
accounts payable increased concurrently with the increase in inventory purchases 
cash flows from investing activities for fiscal  our cash used in investing activities decreased to approximately million from million for fiscal the cash used in fiscal consisted of a million payment for the acquisition of cdm  net of cash acquired  million of equity investments in soi  million in purchases of property  plant and equipment and million in purchase of intangible assets 
these uses were partially offset by a million in proceeds from the consolidation of soi  million reduction in restricted cash as a result of the settlement of court proceedings and the subsequent release of a bond filed pursuant to those proceedings 
for fiscal  our cash used in investing activities increased to approximately million from million for fiscal  due to million in net purchases of short term investments  million in purchases of property  plant and equipment  million in purchases of long term non marketable investments and a million increase in restricted cash 
net cash used in investing activities of million for fiscal resulted from million in net purchases of short term investments  million in purchases of property  plant and equipment and million in purchases of long term investments 
the million increase in purchases of property  plant and equipment in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the additional investment in buildings  building improvements and machinery and equipment to support the expanding operations of hwsc 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we have reclassified certain previously reported amounts to conform them to the current period presentation 
at january   we reclassified certain auction rate securities from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments as of january  and for all prior periods 
as of january  and april   respectively  we held approximately million and million of these auction rate securities  which were reclassified

capital resources we currently expect our available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with cash that we anticipate to be generated from business operations  to be sufficient to satisfy our foreseeable working capital requirements 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in june  our board of directors authorized us to use up to million of our available cash in an open market program to repurchase our common stock 
our ability to generate cash from operations in the future is subject to substantial risks described below under the caption factors affecting future results 
we encourage you to review these risks carefully 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of april  and the effect such obligations and commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands greater less than than total year years years years contractual obligations operating leases noncancelable wafer purchase orders total contractual obligations other commercial commitments investment in china joint venture with tsmc total commercial commitments total contractual obligations and commercial commitments relates to the remaining million of registered capital for our chinese subsidiary 
we established this subsidiary as part of our efforts to increase capacity and reduce costs for testing our camerachips 
in october  we entered into a shareholders agreement with tsmc pursuant to which we agreed with tsmc to form visera  a joint venture in taiwan  for the purposes of providing manufacturing services and automated final testing services related to cmos image sensors 
together with tsmc and certain employees and affiliates of visera  we have committed to provide an aggregate of million in total capital to visera  which commitments may be made in the form of cash or asset contributions 
our company and tsmc have equal interests in visera and our share of this capital commitment to visera is million 
of this amount  we expect to contribute approximately million of assets to the joint venture  including technology  plant and equipment currently owned by us or to be purchased with funds for existing commercial commitments  and net cash of million 
in the first phase  in november  we contributed million in cash to visera and granted a non exclusive license to certain of our manufacturing and automated final testing technologies and patents 
the million shown in the above table represents the balance of our current net cash commitment

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors affecting future results this annual report on form k  including this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause our future business  financial condition or results of operations to differ materially from our historical results or currently anticipated results  including those set forth below 
risks related to our business we face intense competition in our markets from more established cmos and ccd image sensor manufacturers  and if we are unable to compete successfully we may not be able to maintain or grow our business 
the image sensor market is intensely competitive  and we expect competition in this industry to continue to increase 
this competition has resulted in rapid technological change  evolving standards  reductions in product sales prices and rapid product obsolescence 
if we are unable to successfully meet these competitive challenges  we may be unable to maintain and grow our business 
any inability on our part to compete successfully would also adversely affect our results of operations and impair our financial condition 
our image sensor products face competition from other companies that sell cmos image sensors and from companies that sell ccd image sensors 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater presence in key markets  greater name recognition  larger customer bases  more established strategic and financial relationships and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
our competitors include established cmos image sensor manufacturers such as agilent  canon  cypress  ess  fujitsu  kodak  magna chip  micron  mitsubishi electronic  samsung  sharp  sony  stmicroelectronics and toshiba as well as ccd image sensor manufacturers such as fuji  matsushita  nec  sanyo  sharp  sony and toshiba 
in addition  we compete with a large number of smaller cmos manufacturers including foveon  pixart and pixelplus 
competition with these and other companies may force us to reduce our prices 
for instance  we have seen increased competition in the megapixel market with resulting pressures on product pricing 
downward pressure on pricing could result in decreased revenues and gross margins  which would adversely affect our profitability 
in august  we announced the introduction of our new omnipixel technology 
in november  we demonstrated a prototype of our new smart sensor image sensor that is capable of storing and subsequently identifying unique images 
in november  we announced that we are shipping samples of our latest megapixel cmos image sensor to leading manufacturers of camera cell phones 
our new products compete against other cmos image sensors and against ccd image sensors  and we cannot guarantee that existing or new customers will adopt and purchase these new products 
we also cannot guarantee the growth of end user markets that will require these new image sensors 
if our enhanced products and technologies do not gain market acceptance  we may not be able to maintain our market share 
our competitors may acquire or enter into strategic or commercial agreements or arrangements with foundries or providers of color filter processing  assembly or packaging services 
these strategic arrangements between our competitors and third party service providers could involve preferential or exclusive arrangements for our competitors 
such strategic alliances could impair our ability to secure sufficient capacity from foundries and service providers to meet our demand for wafer manufacturing  color filter processing  assembly or packaging services  adversely affecting our ability to meet customer demand for our products 
in addition  competitors may enter into exclusive relationships with distributors  which could reduce available distribution channels for our products and impair our ability to sell our products and grow our business 
further  some of our customers may also be developers of image sensors  and this could potentially adversely affect our results of operations  business and prospects 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our success depends on the timely development  introduction  marketing and selling of new cmos image sensors  which we might not be able to achieve 
our failure to successfully develop new products that achieve market acceptance in a timely fashion would adversely affect our ability to grow our business and our operating results 
in august  we announced the introduction of our new omnipixel technology 
the first product based on the new technology was a megapixel sensor 
in september  we introduced a megapixel sensor based on the omnipixel technology and our first small scale  cmos image sensor with five megapixels based on the omnipixel technology 
in february  we announced the introduction of the first new smart sensor image sensor that is capable of storing and subsequently identifying unique images for applications such as character recognition and facial recognition 
we also plan to introduce several additional image sensor products in the remainder of calendar the development  introduction and market acceptance of products such as these are critical to our ability to sustain and grow our business 
any failure to successfully develop  introduce  market and sell new products could materially adversely affect our business and operating results 
the development of new products is highly complex  and we have in the past experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products 
as our products integrate new and more advanced functions  they become more complex and increasingly difficult to design and debug 
successful product development and introduction depend on a number of factors  including accurate prediction of market requirements and evolving standards  including pixel resolution  output interface standards  power requirements  optical lens size  input standards and operating systems for personal computers and other platforms  development of advanced technologies and capabilities  definition  timely completion and introduction of new cmos image sensors that satisfy customer requirements  development of products that maintain a technological advantage over the products of our competitors  including our advantages with respect to the functionality and pixel capability of our image sensor products and our proprietary testing processes  and market acceptance of the new products 
accomplishing all of this is time consuming and expensive 
we may be unable to develop new products or product enhancements in time to capture market opportunities or achieve a significant or sustainable acceptance in new and existing markets 
in addition  our products could become obsolete sooner than anticipated because of a rapid change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or the reduced life cycles for consumer products 
failure to obtain design wins could cause our market share and revenues to decline and could impair our ability to grow our business 
our future success is dependent upon manufacturers designing our image sensor products into their products 
to achieve design wins  which are decisions by manufacturers to design our products into their systems  we must define and deliver cost effective and innovative image sensor solutions 
our ability to achieve design wins is subject to numerous risks including competitive pressures as well as technological risks 
if we do not achieve a design win with a prospective customer  it may be difficult to sell our image sensor products to such prospective customer in the future because once a manufacturer has designed a supplier s products into its systems  the manufacturer may be reluctant to change its source of components due to the significant costs  time  effort and risk associated with qualifying a new supplier 
accordingly  if we fail to achieve design wins with key device manufacturers that embed image sensors in their products  our market share or revenues could decrease 
furthermore  to the extent that our competitors secure design wins  our ability to expand our business in the future will be impaired 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued historically  our revenues have been dependent upon a few key customers  the loss of one or more of which could significantly reduce our revenues 
historically  a relatively small number of oems  vars and distributors have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues 
any material delay  cancellation or reduction of purchase orders from one of our major customers or distributors could result in our failure to achieve anticipated revenue for a particular period 
if we are unable to retain one or more of our largest oem  distributor or var customers  or if we are unable to maintain our current level of revenues from one or more of these significant customers  our business and results of operation would be impaired and our stock price could decrease  potentially significantly 
in fiscal  two oem customers accounted for approximately and our revenues  respectively 
in fiscal  one distributor customer accounted for approximately of our revenues 
our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will continue to depend significantly on our ability to retain our current key customers and attract new customers  as well as on the financial condition and success of our oems  vars and distributors 
declines in our average sales prices may result in declines in our revenues and gross margin 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience pressure to reduce the sales prices of our products  and our average sales prices have declined as a result 
competition in our product markets is intense and as this competition continues to intensify  we anticipate that these pricing pressures will increase as well 
we expect that the average sales prices for many of our products will continue to decline over time 
declines in our average sales prices could result in reduced revenues unless we can increase unit sales to offset these price declines 
unless we can reduce costs to compensate  reductions in our selling prices will cause a decline in our gross margins and could materially and adversely affect our operating results and impair our financial condition 
we have increased and intend to continue to increase our research and development expenses in an attempt to continue the development of our new generation of image sensor products in fiscal years and however  if we are unable to timely introduce new products that incorporate more advanced technology and include more advanced features that can be sold at higher average sales prices  our financial results could be adversely affected 
problems with wafer manufacturing and or back end processing yields could result in higher product costs and could impair our ability to meet customer demand for our products 
if the foundries manufacturing the wafers used in our products cannot achieve the yields we expect  we will incur higher per unit costs and reduced product availability 
foundries that supply our wafers have experienced problems in the past achieving acceptable wafer manufacturing yields 
wafer yields are a function of both of our design technology and the particular foundry s manufacturing process technology 
low yields may result from design errors or manufacturing failures in new or existing products 
unlike many other semiconductor products  optical products can be effectively tested only when they are complete 
accordingly we perform a final test of our products only after they are assembled 
as a result  yield problems may not be identified until our products are well into the production process 
the risks associated with low yields could be increased because we rely on third party offshore foundries for our wafers  which can increase the effort and time required to identify  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems 
in addition to wafer manufacturing yields  our products are subject to yield loss in subsequent manufacturing steps  often referred to as back end processing  such as dicing cutting the wafer into individual devices  or die and packaging 
any of these potential problems with wafer manufacturing and or back end processing yields could result in a reduction in our ability to timely deliver products to customers  which could adversely affect our customer relations and make it more difficult to sustain and grow our business 
for example  our gross margin for the fiscal quarter ended april  was lower than anticipated due to lower yields on one of our products 
sales of our image sensor products for camera cell phones account for a large portion of our revenues from digital applications on an annual basis  and any decline in sales to the camera cell phone market or failure of this market to continue to grow as expected could adversely affect our results of operations 
sales to the camera cell phone market account for a large portion of our revenues from digital applications 
although we can only estimate the percentages of our products that are used in the camera cell phone market due to the significant amount of our image sensor products that 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued are sold through distributors and vars  we believe that the camera cell phone market accounted for approximately and of our revenues in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our sales to the camera cell phone market increased in fiscal due to a continuing shift toward higher resolutions and increased requirements from service providers to include camera functionality on handsets 
we expect that revenues from sales of our image sensor products to the camera cell phone market will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues during fiscal any factors adversely affecting the demand for our image sensors in this market could cause our business to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations 
the digital image sensor market for camera cell phones is extremely competitive  and we expect to face increased competition in this market in the future 
if we fail to continue to achieve design wins with key camera cell phone manufacturers  our market share or revenues could decrease 
the image sensor market for camera cell phones is also subject to rapid technology change 
in order to compete successfully in this market  we will have to correctly forecast customer demand for technological improvements and be able to deliver such products on a timely basis at competitive costs 
if we fail to do this  our results of operations  business and prospects would be materially adversely affected 
in the past  we have experienced problems accurately forecasting customer demand in other markets 
if sales to the camera cell phone market do not increase  our results of operations  business and prospects would be materially adversely affected 
if we do not forecast customer demand correctly  our business could be impaired and our stock price may decline 
our sales are generally made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term purchase commitments  and we manufacture products and build inventory based on our estimates of customer demand 
accordingly  we must rely on multiple assumptions about forecasted customer demand 
we are continually working to improve our sales forecasting procedures 
if we overestimate customer demand  we may manufacture products that we may be unable to sell  or we may have to sell our products to other customers at lower prices 
this could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  our customers may cancel or defer orders at any time 
we have experienced problems with accurately forecasting customer demand in the past 
for example  beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  the demand for our image sensor products for use in pc cameras decreased significantly and one of our significant oem customers unexpectedly canceled its purchase orders 
recently  our customers have increasingly pushed to have us fill orders quickly 
this results in a smaller backlog of orders and requires us to more accurately predict customer demand because we have to make commitments to have products manufactured before we receive firm purchase orders from our customers 
if we underestimate customer demand  we may be unable to manufacture sufficient products quickly enough to meet actual demand  causing us to lose customers and impairing our ability to grow our business 
in preparation for new product introductions  we gradually ramp down production of established products 
with our week production cycle  it is extremely difficult to predict precisely how many units of established products we will need 
the length of our production cycle required that we increase work in process inventory during the third quarter of fiscal in anticipation of increased sales activity during and following the fourth quarter of fiscal it will also be difficult to accurately predict the speed of the ramp of our new products and the impact on inventory levels presented by the shorter life cycles of end user products 
the shorter product life cycle is a result of an increase in competition and the growth of various consumer product applications for image sensors 
for example  although in the security and surveillance market we continue to sell image sensor products introduced more than four years ago  in the camera cell phone market  the product life cycle of image sensors can be as little as six months 
under these circumstances  it is possible that we could suffer from shortages for certain products and  if we underestimate market demand  we face the risk of being unable to fulfill customer orders 
we also face the risk of excess inventory and product obsolescence if we overestimate market demand for our products and build inventories in excess of demand 
our ability to accurately forecast sales is also a critical factor in our ability to meet analyst expectations for our quarterly and annual operating results 
any failure to meet these expectations would likely lead to a substantial decline in our stock price 
our lengthy manufacturing  packaging and assembly cycle  in addition to our customers design cycle  may result in uncertainty and delays in generating revenues 
the production of our image sensors requires a lengthy manufacturing  packaging and assembly process  typically lasting approximately 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued weeks 
additional time may pass before a customer commences volume shipments of products that incorporate our image sensors 
even when a manufacturer decides to design our image sensors into its products  the manufacturer may never ship final products incorporating our image sensors 
given this lengthy cycle  we experience a delay between the time we incur expenditures for research and development and sales and marketing efforts and the time we generate revenue  if any  from these expenditures 
this delay makes it more difficult to forecast customer demand  which adds uncertainty to the manufacturing planning process and could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  the product life cycle for certain of our image sensor products designed for use in certain applications can be relatively short 
if we fail to appropriately time the manufacturing  packaging and assembly process  our products may become obsolete before they can be incorporated into our customers products and we may never realize a return on investment for the expenditures we incur in developing and producing these products 
we depend on a limited number of third party wafer foundries  which reduces our ability to control our manufacturing process 
we do not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility 
instead  we primarily rely on tsmc  psc and other subcontract foundries to produce all of our wafers 
historically  we have relied upon tsmc to provide us with a substantial majority of our wafers 
as a part of our joint venture with tsmc  tsmc has agreed to commit substantial wafer manufacturing capacity to us in exchange for our commitment to purchase a substantial portion of our wafers from tsmc  subject to pricing and technology requirements 
we do not have long term supply agreements with any other foundries 
as a result  we have to secure manufacturing availability on a purchase order basis 
these foundries have no obligation to supply products to us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specific price  except as set forth in a particular purchase order 
in general  our reliance on third party foundries involves a number of significant risks  including reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs  lack of guaranteed production capacity or product supply  unavailability of  or delayed access to  next generation or key process technologies  and financial difficulties or disruptions in the operations of third party foundries due to causes beyond our control 
if tsmc or any of our other foundries were unable to continue manufacturing our wafers in the required volumes  at acceptable quality  yields and costs  or in a timely manner  we would have to identify and qualify substitute foundries  which would be time consuming and difficult  and could increase our costs or result in unforeseen manufacturing problems 
in addition  if competition for foundry capacity increases we may be required to pay increased amounts for manufacturing services 
we are also exposed to additional risks if we transfer our production of semiconductors from one foundry to another  as such transfer could interrupt our manufacturing process 
further  some of our foundries may also be developers of image sensor products 
if one or more of our other foundries were to decide not to fabricate our interface chips for competitive or other reasons  we would have to identify and qualify other sources for these products 
we rely on third party service providers for color filter application and packaging services  which reduces our control over delivery schedules  product quality and cost  and could adversely affect our ability to deliver products to customers 
we rely on visera our joint venture with tsmc and dai nippon printing for the color filter processing of our completed wafers 
in addition  we rely on advanced semiconductor engineering inc  or ase  impac  kyocera and sun yang digital image  or sydi  for substantially all of our ceramic chip packages 
we rely on impac  our equity investee  for our plastic chip packages 
we rely on xintec  another investee company  and to a lesser extent  shellcase  for chip scale packages  which are generally used in our products designed for the smallest form factor applications 
we do not have long term agreements with any of these service providers and typically obtain services on a purchase order basis 
if for any reason one or more of these service providers becomes unable or unwilling to continue to provide color filter 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued processing or packaging services of acceptable quality  at acceptable costs and in a timely manner  our ability to deliver our products to our customers could be severely impaired 
we would have to identify and qualify substitute service providers  which could be time consuming and difficult and could result in unforeseen operational problems 
substitute service providers might not be available or  if available  might be unwilling or unable to offer services on acceptable terms 
in addition  if competition for color filter processing or packaging capacity increases  we may be required to pay or invest significant amounts to secure access to these services  which could adversely impact our operating results 
the number of companies that provide these services is limited and some of them have limited operating histories and financial resources 
in the event our current providers refuse or are unable to continue to provide these services to us  we may be unable to procure services from alternate service providers 
furthermore  if customer demand for our products increases  we may be unable to secure sufficient additional capacity from our current service providers on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
moreover  our reliance on a limited number of third party service providers to provide color filter processing services subjects us to reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and costs 
this lack of control may cause unforeseen product shortages or may increase our costs of manufacturing  assembling or testing of our products  which would adversely affect our operating results 
our ability to deliver products that meet customer demand is dependent upon our ability to meet new and changing requirements for color filter application and sensor packaging 
we expect that as we develop new products to meet technological advances and new and changing industry and customer demands  our color filter application and ceramic  plastic and chip scale packaging requirements will also evolve 
our ability to continue to profitably deliver products that meet customer demand is dependent upon our ability to procure third party services that meet these new requirements on a cost effective basis 
we have historically relied exclusively on third parties to provide these services 
there can be no assurances that any of these parties will be able to develop enhancements to the services they provide to us to meet these new and changing industry and customer requirements 
furthermore  even if these service providers are able to develop their services to meet new and evolving requirements  these services may not be available at a cost that enables us to sustain profitability 
we depend on the increased acceptance of mass market image sensor applications to grow our business and increase our revenues 
our business strategy depends in large part on the continued growth of various markets into which we sell our image sensor products  including the markets for camera cell phones  digital still and video cameras  commercial and home security and surveillance applications and toys and games  including interactive video games 
our ability to sustain and grow our business also depends on the emergence of new markets for our products such as smart sensor applications  cameras for automotive applications  personal identification systems  medical imaging devices and embedded applications for personal computers 
if these current and new markets do not grow and develop as anticipated  we may be unable to sustain or grow the sales of our products 
in addition  the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected if certain of these new markets do not emerge or develop as expected 
securities analysts may already factor revenue from such new markets into their future estimates of our financial performance and any failure of such markets to develop as expected by such securities analysts may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our customers experience fluctuating product cycles and seasonality  which could cause our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period 
many of the products using our image sensors  such as digital still cameras  camera cell phones and cameras for toys and games  are consumer electronics goods 
these mass market camera devices generally have seasonal cycles which historically have caused the sales of our customers to fluctuate quarter to quarter 
these seasonal demand patterns could  in turn  cause our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period 
historically  demand from oems and distributors that serve such consumer product markets has been stronger in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year and weaker in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year 
if we fail to predict accurately and 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued respond appropriately on a timely basis to meet seasonal fluctuations  or if there is any disruption of consumer buying habits during these key periods  our business and operating results would be harmed 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results make it difficult to predict our future performance and may result in volatility in the market price of our common stock 
our quarterly operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future based on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors and other industry risks  many of which are more fully discussed in our other risk factors  include our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products  our ability to achieve acceptable wafer manufacturing yields  our gain or loss of a large customer  our ability to manage our product transitions  the availability of production capacities at the semiconductor foundries that manufacture our products or components of our products  the growth of the market for products and applications using cmos image sensors  the timing and size of orders from our customers  the volume of our product returns  the seasonal nature of customer demand for our products  the deferral of customer orders in anticipation of new products  product designs or enhancements by us  and the announcement and introduction of products and technologies by our competitors 
in addition  our introduction of new products and our product mix have affected and may continue to affect our quarterly operating results 
changes in our product mix could adversely affect our operating results  because some products provide higher margins than others 
we typically experience lower yields when manufacturing new products through the initial production phase  and consequently our gross margins on new products have historically been lower than our gross margins on our more established products 
we also anticipate that the rate of orders from our customers may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our expenses  including our future capital commitments to hwsc  and our joint venture with tsmc are relatively fixed  and our inventory levels are based on our expectations of future revenues 
consequently  if we do not achieve revenues in any quarter as expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our operating results for that quarter  and potentially future quarters  may be harmed 
any one or more of these factors is difficult to forecast and could result in fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
our operating results in a given quarter could be substantially less than anticipated  and  if we fail to meet market analyst expectations  a substantial decline in our stock price could result 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could adversely affect the price of our common stock in a manner unrelated to our long term operating performance 
changes in accounting rules for stock based compensation will adversely affect our reported operating results  and may adversely affect our stock price and our competitiveness in the employee marketplace 
since our founding  we have used employee stock options and other stock based compensation to hire  motivate and retain our employees 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  which will require that  beginning in the quarter ending july   we measure compensation costs for all stock based compensation including stock options at fair value and recognize these costs as expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
the recognition of these expenses in our statements of income will have a negative affect on our earnings per share  which could negatively impact our future stock price 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in addition  if we reduce or alter our use of stock based compensation to minimize the recognition of these expenses  our ability to recruit  motivate and retain employees may be impaired  which could put us at a competitive disadvantage in the employee marketplace 
we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired 
we are required under generally accepted accounting principles to review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization  and slower growth rates in our industry 
we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined 
this may adversely impact our results of operations 
as of april   our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets totaled approximately million 
we maintain a backlog of customer orders that is subject to cancellation or delay in delivery schedules  and any cancellation or delay may result in lower than anticipated revenues 
our sales are generally made pursuant to standard purchase orders 
we include in our backlog only those customer orders for which we have accepted purchase orders and assigned shipment dates within the upcoming months 
orders constituting our current backlog are subject to cancellation or changes in delivery schedules  and backlog may not necessarily be an indication of future revenue 
any cancellation or delay in orders which constitute our current or future backlog may result in lower than expected revenues 
if we are unable to successfully implement and maintain processes and procedures to achieve and maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting  our ability to provide reliable and timely financial reports could be harmed and this could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
we are required to comply with the rules promulgated under section of the sarbanes oxley act of section requires that we prepare an annual management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  and requires a report by our independent registered public accountants addressing this assessment  and addressing the effectiveness of our internal control 
pursuant to section  we were required to perform an evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting as of april   and have pricewaterhousecoopers llp  an independent registered public accounting firm  publicly attest to such evaluation 
as of april   management asserted  and pricewaterhousecoopers attested  that there were no material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting 
while we currently believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective  the effectiveness of our internal controls in future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in our internal processes  and or the degree of our compliance with our internal controls over financial reporting or with our policies or procedures may deteriorate 
if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective for any given reporting period or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to attest that our management s report is fairly stated or they are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls  our ability to provide reliable and timely financial reports could be harmed  investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and this could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
we have in the past discovered  and may in the future discover  areas of our internal controls that need improvement 
for example  we restated our financial statements for the first  second and third quarters of fiscal the restatements arose out of an internal review which was initiated in response to issues raised by an employee 
we notified the audit committee of the board of directors of the issues raised  and the audit committee  with assistance from special legal counsel  conducted its own independent investigation 
as a result of the internal review and the independent investigation  management and the audit committee determined that certain errors had occurred which principally affected the timing of revenue recognition for certain sales 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the independent investigation concluded that there was no evidence of wrongdoing in connection with these errors 
the restatements of our financial results for the first three quarters of fiscal related primarily to two issues identified as part of the internal review and independent investigation 
first  beginning in the second half of fiscal and continuing through the first nine months of fiscal  certain distribution sales  for which we recognize revenue on a sell through basis  were not reported to us by one of our distributors in a timely manner 
in addition  in the second and third quarters of fiscal  during the transition of testing operations and certain international sales functions to overseas locations  some shipments made to customers late in the quarter were incorrectly classified as transferring title upon delivery as opposed to upon shipment  and therefore revenue was not recognized when product was shipped 
both of these issues resulted in delayed revenue recognition 
in july  and partly in connection with the restatement of our financial statements for the first  second and third quarters of fiscal  pricewaterhousecoopers llp identified material weaknesses in our internal controls and procedures relating to errors in our recognition of revenue resulting from incorrectly reviewing distributor reports and from incorrectly applying revenue recognition policies in accordance with title transfer  risk of loss and related shipping terms 
pricewaterhousecoopers llp also noted a material weakness related to our need to increase our financial reporting and accounting staffing levels to ensure that we can meet our financial reporting obligations given the significant growth in our business in recent periods 
if these or similar types of issues arise with respect to our internal controls in future periods  they could impair our ability to produce accurate and timely financial reports 
corporate governance regulations have recently increased our compliance costs and could further increase our expenses if changes occur within our business 
changes in laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act  have imposed new requirements on us and on our officers  directors  attorneys and independent accountants 
in order to comply with these new rules  we have added internal resources and have utilized additional outside legal  accounting and advisory services  which increased our operating expenses in the fiscal year ending april  we expect to incur ongoing operating expenses as we maintain compliance with section in addition  if we undergo significant modifications to our structure through personnel or system changes  acquisitions  or otherwise  it may be increasingly difficult to maintain compliance with the existing and evolving corporate governance regulations 
there are risks associated with our operations in china 
in december  we established hwsc as part of our efforts to streamline our manufacturing process and reduce the costs and working capital associated with the testing of our image sensor products  and relocated our automated image testing equipment from the united states to china 
in addition  we also expect to expand testing capabilities with additional automated testing equipment  which will also be located in china 
however  there are significant administrative  legal and governmental risks to operating in china that could result in increased operating expenses or that could prevent us from achieving our objectives in operations 
the risks from operating in china that could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and ability to deliver our products and grow our business include  without limitation difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  particularly in attracting and retaining personnel qualified to design  sell and support cmos image sensors  difficulties in coordinating our operations in china with those in california  diversion of management attention  difficulties in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies across our global operations  including inventory management and financial consolidation  political and economic instability  which could have an adverse impact on foreign exchange rates in asia and could impair our ability to conduct our business in china  and inadequacy of the local infrastructure to support our needs 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we may experience integration or other problems with the recent or potential future acquisitions  which could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
new acquisitions could dilute the interests of existing stockholders  and the announcement of new acquisitions could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 
on april   we acquired all the outstanding securities of cdm optics  inc  or cdm  and cdm became a wholly owned subsidiary of our company 
we may in the future make other acquisitions of  or investments in  businesses that offer products  services and technologies that we believe would complement our products  including cmos image sensor manufacturers 
we may also make acquisitions of  or investments in  businesses that we believe could expand our distribution channels 
even if we were to announce an acquisition  we may not be able to complete it 
in addition  our acquisition of cdm and any future acquisition or substantial investment could present numerous risks  including difficulty in realizing the potential technological benefits of the transaction  difficulty in integrating the technology  operations or work force of the acquired business with our existing business  unanticipated expenses related to technology integration  disruption of our ongoing business  difficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transaction  difficulty in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  possible impairment of relationships with employees  customers  suppliers and strategic partners as a result of integration of new businesses and management personnel  impairment of assets related to resulting goodwill  and reductions in our future operating results from amortization of intangible assets  and potential unknown or unexpected liabilities associated with acquired businesses 
in connection with our acquisition of cdm  we delivered and will deliver consideration in the form of cash and shares of our common stock  and we expect that any future acquisitions could include consideration to be paid in cash  shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and our common stock 
if and when consideration for a transaction is paid in common stock  including the cdm transaction  it will result in dilution to our existing stockholders 
we may never achieve the anticipated benefits from our joint venture with tsmc 
in october  we entered into an agreement with tsmc to form visera  a joint venture in taiwan  for the purposes of providing manufacturing services and automated final testing services 
we expect that visera will eventually be able to provide us with a committed supply of high quality manufacturing services and automated final testing services at competitive prices 
however  there are significant legal  governmental and relationship risks to developing visera  and we cannot ensure that we will receive the expected benefits from the joint venture 
for example  visera may not be able to provide manufacturing services or automated testing services that have competitive technology or prices  which could adversely affect our product offerings and our ability to meet customer requirements for our products 
in addition  the formation of visera provides us with an additional source for certain manufacturing services which  in the future  may also make it more difficult for us to secure dependable services from competing merchant vendors who provide similar manufacturing services 
we are required to account for our investment in visera under the equity method  and any loss that visera incurs will negatively impact our reported earnings 
we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our alliances with  and strategic investments in  third parties 
we expect to develop our business partly through forming alliances or joint ventures with and making strategic investments in other companies  some of which may be companies at a relatively early stage of development 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued for example  in april we made an investment in xintec  a chip scale packaging service company  and in june we completed an investment in impac 
in addition  in october  we entered into an agreement with tsmc to form visera  a joint venture in taiwan 
in may  we entered into an agreement with psc under which we established soi  a joint venture as a company incorporated under the laws of taiwan  and we contributed million in exchange for an ownership percentage of approximately 
on april   soi was consolidated with our financial statements for the first time  and will be included in our consolidated operating results in fiscal the purpose of the joint venture is to conduct the business of manufacturing  marketing and selling of certain of our legacy products 
our investment in these companies may negatively impact our operating results  because  under certain circumstances  we are required to recognize our portion of any loss recorded by each of these companies or to consolidate them into our operating results 
in fiscal  we recognized a loss of approximately million as our portion of the losses recorded by impac  soi and visera which we are accounting for using the equity method 
we expect to continue to utilize partnerships  strategic alliances and investments  particularly those that enhance our manufacturing capacity and those that provide manufacturing services and testing capability 
these investments and partnering arrangements are crucial to our ability to grow our business and meet the increasing demands of our customers 
however  we cannot ensure that we will achieve the benefits expected as a result of these alliances 
for instance  we may not be able to receive acceptable quality and or wafer manufacturing yields from these companies  which could result in higher operating costs and could impair our ability to meet customer demand for our products 
in addition  certain of these investments or partnering relationships may place restrictions on the scope of our business  the geographic areas in which we can sell our products and the types of products that we can manufacture and sell 
for example  our agreement with tsmc provides that we may not engage in business that will directly compete with the business of visera 
this type of non competition provision may impact our ability to grow our business and to meet the demands of our customers 
several of these companies are at a relatively early stage of development and consequently they may continue to incur losses on a quarterly and annual basis for an extended period 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property  and therefore we may lose some of our competitive advantage 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies 
we have been issued patents and have a number of pending united states and foreign patent applications 
however  we cannot provide assurance that any patent will be issued as a result of any applications or  if issued  that any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
it is possible that existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
for example  in august we initiated a patent infringement action in taiwan  republic of china against ic media corporation of san jose  california for infringement of a taiwanese patent that had been issued to us 
in response to our patent infringement action  in october  ic media corporation initiated a cancellation proceeding in the taiwan intellectual property office with respect to the above referenced patent 
in july  the taiwan intellectual property office made an initial determination to grant the cancellation of the subject patent  which decision was upheld by the taiwan ministry of economic affairs and the high administrative court 
we decided not to appeal such decision by the may  deadline 
although we do not believe the cancellation of the taiwanese patent at issue in the dispute described above will have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects  there may be other situations where our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could materially and adversely affect our competitive position and operating results 
if a third party can copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization  develop corresponding technology independently or design around our patents  this could materially adversely affect our business and prospects 
effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries 
any disputes over our intellectual property rights  whatever the ultimate resolution of such disputes  may result in costly and time consuming litigation or require the license of additional elements of intellectual property for a fee 
we have been named as a defendant in certain litigation that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
we are currently a defendant in ongoing litigation matters as described in part i  item legal proceedings of this annual report 
we 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued are currently unable to estimate the possible loss or possible range of loss  if any  associated with the resolution of these litigation matters 
if we do not prevail in these matters  such failure could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows in the future 
in addition  the results of litigation are uncertain  and the litigation process may utilize a portion of our cash resources and divert management s attention from the day to day operations of our company  all of which could harm our business 
litigation regarding intellectual property could divert management attention  be costly to defend and prevent us from using or selling the challenged technology 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving intellectual property rights  including in the semiconductor industry 
we have in the past been  are currently  and may in the future be subject to legal proceedings and claims with respect to our intellectual property  including such matters as trade secrets  patents  product liabilities and other actions arising out of the normal course of business 
see part i  item legal proceedings of this annual report 
these claims may increase as our intellectual property portfolio becomes larger or more valuable 
intellectual property claims against us  and any resulting lawsuit  may cause us to incur significant expenses  subject us to liability for damages and invalidate our proprietary rights 
in fiscal we paid million to settle a litigation matter 
these lawsuits  regardless of their outcome  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and could divert management s time and attention 
any potential intellectual property litigation against us could also force us to take actions such as ceasing the sale or use of products or services that incorporate the infringed intellectual property  obtaining from the holder of the infringed intellectual property a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or redesigning those products or services that incorporate the disputed intellectual property  which could result in substantial unanticipated development expenses and prevent us from selling the products until the redesign is completed  if at all 
if we are subject to a successful claim of infringement and we fail to develop non infringing intellectual property or license the infringed intellectual property on acceptable terms and on a timely basis  we may be unable to sell some or all of our products  and our operating results could be adversely affected 
we may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors 
these claims could also result in significant expense and the diversion of technical and management attention 
if we do not effectively manage our growth  our ability to increase our revenues and improve our earnings could be adversely affected 
our growth has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on our management and other resources 
to manage our growth effectively  we must  among other things significantly improve our operational  financial and accounting systems  train and manage our existing employee base  attract and retain qualified personnel with relevant experience  and effectively manage accounts receivable and inventory 
for example  our failure to effectively manage our inventory levels could either result in excess inventories  which could adversely affect our gross margins and operating results  or lead to an inability to fill customer orders  which would result in lower sales and could harm our relationships with existing and potential customers 
we also must manage multiple relationships with customers  business partners and other third parties  such as our foundries and process and assembly vendors 
moreover  our growth may significantly overburden our management and financial systems and other resources 
we may not make adequate allowances for the costs and risks associated with our expansion 
in addition  our systems  procedures or controls may not 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued be adequate to support our operations  and we may not be able to expand quickly enough to capitalize on potential market opportunities 
our future operating results will also depend on our ability to expand sales and marketing  research and development  accounting  finance and administrative support 
our future tax rates could be higher than we anticipate if the proportion of future operating income generated outside the us by our foreign subsidiaries is less than we expect 
a number of factors will affect our future tax rate  and certain of these factors could increase our effective tax rate in future periods  which could adversely impact our operating results 
for example  if our foreign subsidiaries are unable to achieve the levels of operating income that we expect  our effective tax rate may be significantly higher than it has been in prior periods 
in common with all multi national companies  we are subject to tax in multiple jurisdictions 
the tax authorities in any given jurisdiction may seek to increase the taxes being collected by  for example  asserting that the transfer prices we charge between related entities are either too high or too low depending on which side of the transaction they are looking at 
although we believe we have provided sufficient taxes for all prior periods  adjustments that could be proposed could  in some cases  result in liabilities in excess of such provisions 
our sales through distributors increase the complexity of our business  which may increase our operating costs and may reduce our ability to forecast revenues 
during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  approximately and of our sales were made through distributors 
selling through distributors reduces our ability to accurately forecast sales and increases the complexity of our business  requiring us to  among other matters manage a more complex supply chain  manage the level of inventory at each distributor  provide for credits  return rights and price protection  estimate the impact of credits  return rights  price protection and unsold inventory at distributors  and monitor the financial condition and creditworthiness of our distributors 
any failure to manage these challenges could cause us to inaccurately forecast sales and carry excess or insufficient inventory  thereby adversely affecting our operating results 
we face foreign business  political and economic risks  because a majority of our products and those of our customers are manufactured and sold outside of the united states 
we face difficulties in managing our third party foundries  color filter application service providers  ceramic and plastic packaging service providers and our foreign distributors  most of whom are located in asia 
any political and economic instability in asia might have an adverse impact on foreign exchange rates and could cause service disruptions for our vendors and distributors and adversely affect our customers 
sales outside of the united states accounted for approximately of our revenues for fiscal and fiscal we anticipate that sales outside of the united states will continue to account for nearly all of our revenues in future periods 
dependence on sales to foreign customers involves certain risks  including longer payment cycles  the adverse effects of tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions that impair trade  decreased visibility as to future demand  difficulties in accounts receivable collections  and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and labor practices 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued sales of our products have been denominated to date exclusively in us dollars 
over the last several years  the us dollar has weakened against most other currencies 
future increases in the value of the us dollar  if any  would increase the price of our products in the currency of the countries in which our customers are located 
this may result in our customers seeking lower priced suppliers  which could adversely impact our operating results 
a portion of our international revenues may be denominated in foreign currencies in the future  which would subject us to risks associated with fluctuations in those foreign currencies 
we may be unable to maintain our recent levels of profitability 
if we fail to sustain or increase our recent levels of profitability  our financial condition may be materially and adversely affected  and the trading price of our common stock may decline 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we recorded net income of million  million and million  respectively 
we plan to hire additional personnel throughout various departments of our company  and we expect our selling  general and administrative and other expenses to increase 
if our revenues were to decrease or if we cannot effectively control the growth of our expenses  we may be unable to sustain profitability at levels consistent with our recent financial performance 
the high level of complexity and integration of our products increases the risk of latent defects  which could damage customer relationships and increase our costs 
because we integrate many functions on a single chip  our products are complex and are based upon evolving technology 
the integration of additional functions into the complex operations of our products could result in a greater risk that customers or end users could discover latent defects or subtle faults after volumes of product have already been shipped 
although we test our products  we have in the past and may in the future encounter defects or errors 
for example  in the third quarter of fiscal  we made a provision of million related to the possible replacement of products that did not meet a particular customer s specifications 
delivery of products with defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems may damage our reputation and ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
in addition  product defects and errors could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical resources  delayed product shipments  increased product returns  product warranty costs for recall and replacement and product liability claims against us which may not be fully covered by insurance 
our business could be harmed if we lose the services of one or more members of our senior management team  or if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees  or the decision of one or more of these individuals to join a competitor  could adversely affect our business and harm our operating results and financial condition 
our success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of our senior management and certain other key technical personnel 
none of our senior management is bound by an employment or non competition agreement 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our employees 
our success also depends on our ability to identify  attract and retain qualified sales  marketing  finance  management and technical personnel  particularly analog or mixed signal design engineers 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications 
if we do not succeed in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications  our revenues and product development efforts could be harmed 
we may not be able to integrate cdm s business operations into our company successfully 
therefore  we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition  which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
we acquired cdm with the expectation that the acquisition would result in benefits to us 
however  the acquisition involves the integration of two companies that have previously operated independently and therefore requires significant effort from each company to integrate research and development  along with sales and marketing  administrative and customer service functions  and management information systems 
such integration may be time consuming and costly and we may encounter difficulties integrating cdm s technology into our 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued products in a profitable manner or we may experience the loss of cdm s or our personnel 
if the integration does not proceed as expected  if we are not able to integrate cdm s technology into our products  if the attention of management is diverted or if we encounter any other difficulties or unanticipated expenses in the transition process  the anticipated benefits may not be realized and the price of our common stock may be affected 
we need to upgrade our enterprise resource planning system 
as our business grows and becomes more complex  we have to expand and upgrade our enterprise resource planning  or erp  system which is critical to the accounting and financial functions of our company 
our current erp system was developed for companies much smaller than we are now 
we are now in the early stages of evaluating alternative solutions  both short term and long term  to meet the operating  administrative and financial reporting requirements of our business 
failure to properly or adequately address these issues could result in the diversion of management s attention and resources and could materially adversely affect our operating results and impact our ability to manage our business 
at some point  we may outgrow our existing erp system and need to transition our systems to a new platform 
such a transition would be time consuming and costly  and would require management resources in excess of those we currently have 
our operations may be impaired as a result of disasters  business interruptions or similar events 
disasters such as earthquakes  water  fire  electrical failure  accidents and epidemics affecting our operating activities  major facilities  and employees and customers health could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
in particular  our asian operations and most of our third party manufacturers and service providers involved in the manufacturing of our products are located within relative close proximity 
therefore  any disaster that strikes within close proximity of that geographic area could be tremendously disruptive to our business and could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we do not currently have a disaster recovery plan 
acts of war and terrorist acts may seriously harm our business and revenue  costs and expenses and financial condition 
acts of war or terrorist acts  wherever they occur around the world  may cause damage or disruption to our business  employees  facilities  suppliers  distributors or customers  which could significantly impact our revenue  costs  expenses and financial condition 
in addition  as a company with significant operations and major distributors and customers located in asia  we may be adversely impacted by heightened tensions and acts of war that occur in locations such as the korean peninsula  taiwan and china 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks or perceived threats to national security  and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
we are uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 
risks related to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock provisions in our charter documents and delaware law  as well as our stockholders rights plan  could prevent or delay a change in control of our company and may reduce the market price of our common stock 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable 
these provisions include adjusting the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of preferred stock without stockholder approval  providing for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  requiring supermajority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  and 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent 
provisions of delaware law also may discourage  delay or prevent another company from acquiring or merging with us 
our board of directors adopted a preferred stock rights agreement in august pursuant to the rights agreement  our board of directors declared a dividend of one right to purchase one one thousandth share of our series a participating preferred stock for each outstanding share of our common stock 
the dividend was paid on september  to stockholders of record as of the close of business on that date 
each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from us one one thousandth of a share of series a preferred at an exercise price of reflecting the stock split that took effect on february  and the amendment to the rights agreement our board of directors approved in june  subject to adjustment 
the exercise of the rights could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of our company  including  without limitation  discouraging a proxy contest or making more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock 
the rights agreement could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock 
our stock has been and will likely continue to be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  that may prevent our stockholders from selling our common stock at a profit 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially  and there can be no assurance that such volatility will not continue 
since the beginning of fiscal through july   the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a high of per share to a low of per share 
the closing sales price of our common stock on july  was per share 
the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in the past  and the market prices of the securities of semiconductor companies have been especially volatile 
this market volatility  as well as general economic  market or political conditions  could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  changes in financial estimates of securities analysts  release of lock up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding shares of common stock or sales of additional shares of common stock  sales or the perception in the market of possible sales of shares of our common stock by our directors  officers  employees or principal stockholders  changes in market valuations of other technology companies  and announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations  design wins  contracts  standards or acquisitions 
due to these factors  the price of our stock may decline and investors may be unable to resell their shares of our stock for a profit 
in addition  the stock market experiences extreme volatility that often is unrelated to the performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to decline regardless of our performance

the great majority of our transactions with our customers and vendors denominated in us dollars 
the only expenses we incur in currencies other than us dollars are certain costs affecting gross profit  selling  general and administrative and research and development expenses  which are primarily incurred in china  where chinese yuan renminbi cny is the local currency 
historically  the chinese government has benchmarked the cny exchange ratio against the us dollar  thereby mitigating the associated foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk 
we do not believe that our foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk is significant  especially if the chinese government continues to benchmark the cny against the us dollar 
moreover  given that the only expenses that we incur in denominations other than us dollars are certain cost affecting gross profits  selling  general and administrative and research and development expenses which historically have not been a significant percentage of our revenues  we do not believe that a change in foreign currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on our future net income or cash flows 
we have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies or used any other derivative financial instruments as we do not believe that we currently have any significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk 
although we transact our business in us dollars  future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the competitiveness of our products and results of operations 
quantitative and qualitative discussion of market interest rate risk our cash equivalents and short term investments are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect our interest income and  in the future  the fair market value of our investments 
we manage our exposure to financial market risk by performing ongoing evaluations of our investment portfolio 
we presently invest in money market funds  certificates of deposit issued by banks  high grade corporate securities and government bonds maturing approximately months or less from the date of purchase  with the exception of auction rate securities  which bear a maturity date of up to thirty years and are re negotiated every days 
due to the short maturities of our investments  the carrying value should approximate the fair market value 
in addition  we do not use our investments for trading or other speculative purposes 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  we do not expect that an immediate change in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates
