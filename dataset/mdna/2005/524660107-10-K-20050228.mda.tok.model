item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation beginning on page in our businesses serving office furniture manufacturers and users of plastic components  we will continue striving to develop new products  providing opportunities to supply more components to customers 
we also expect to continue making strategic acquisitions that add new products or expand operations into new regions of the world 
overview of the aluminum products segment segment groups business units aluminum products aluminum die casting tool die our aluminum products segment is the leading independent producer of non automotive aluminum die castings in north america 
we also produce zinc and magnesium die castings 
we work with customers from the design concept stage to market introduction and then through the product lifecycle to refine the product and reduce cost 
we sell aluminum  zinc and magnesium die cast components to a diverse group of customers that manufacture industrial and consumer products 
our customers include small engine and diesel engine builders motorcycle  truck  off road and recreational vehicle including all terrain vehicles and snowmobiles and automobile makers manufacturers of outdoor lighting fixtures  cable line amplifiers  wireless communications systems and other cable and telecommunication products gas barbeque grill manufacturers consumer appliance and power tool manufacturers computer  electronic and electric motor producers 
table of contents we also manufacture and refurbish dies also known as molds or tools for all types and sizes of die casting machines 
these are sold to customers that buy our die castings and to other die cast manufacturers 
we also provide extensive machining  coating  finishing  sub assembly and other value added services related to the die cast components that we sell 
key strategies market share growth is a major focus 
we plan to continue to pursue large users of castings  target customers who currently make some of their own aluminum components  and look for opportunities to expand into new markets where die cast components are used 
we plan to continue striving to develop technology that allows opportunities for growth in new markets 
finally  we are committed to establishing a global presence  enabling us to supply customers as they take more production overseas 
acquisitions may play a part in accomplishing these plans 
overview of the industrial materials segment segment groups business units industrial materials wire wire drawing wire products steel rod tubing steel tubing the industrial materials segment produces steel rod  drawn wire and welded steel tubing  as well as specialty wire products 
drawn wire and welded steel tubing are important raw materials that are widely used to manufacture our products 
about of the drawn wire and about of the welded steel tubing that we produce is used to manufacture other products made by the company 
for example  wire is used to make bedding and furniture components commercial fixtures and point of purchase displays automotive seating components welded steel tubing is used in many of the same products including motion furniture mechanisms store fixtures  displays  shelving and storage products automotive seat frames atv  rv and snowmobile accessories in addition to supplying a portion of our own raw material needs  we sell drawn wire and welded steel tubing to a diverse group of industrial customers  including bedding and furniture makers automotive seating manufacturers lawn and garden equipment manufacturers recreational equipment eg atv and rv producers mechanical spring makers we also produce specialty wire products such as wire ties used by cotton gins to tie bales of cotton wire tying heads used by waste recyclers and solid waste removal businesses to bale materials shaped wire used by automotive companies and medical supply businesses 
table of contents currently  our wire mills use over  tons of steel rod each year 
our steel rod mill has provided a consistent supply of quality steel rod for the industrial materials segment 
the rod mill produces about  tons annually  nearly all of which is used by leggett businesses 
the mill produces only a few sizes and types of rod improving the mill s operating efficiency 
we operate the mill s electric furnace which has a capacity of about one million tons during off peak times to reduce energy costs 
the mill is located near a steel scrap market that over the long term should provide consistent supply to the mill 
the rod mill is also located reasonably close to our wire mills 
key strategies the core strategy of our wire and tubing businesses is to efficiently supply other leggett businesses raw material requirements 
we expect that growth  to a large extent  should occur as our internal requirements expand  both domestically and abroad 
we also expect to grow as we work with customers on programs that improve their efficiency for example  packaging multiple components supplied by other leggett businesses 
finally  we expect to expand our capabilities to add value through the forming  shaping  and welding of our wire and tube 
this may occur through start up operations or acquisitions 
overview of the specialized products segment segment groups business units specialized products automotive automotive machinery machinery our specialized products segment manufactures components for the automotive industry and designs  builds and sells specialized machinery and equipment 
in the automotive group  we manufacture lumbar systems for automotive seating including manual  way power  way power  massage systems  and memory options seat suspension systems automotive control cables  such as shift cables  cruise control cables  seat belt cables  accelerator cables  seat control cables  and latch release cables primary customers for these products are automobile seating manufacturers 
in the machinery group  we primarily manufacture highly automated quilting machines for fabrics used to cover mattresses and other home furnishings coilers used to shape wire into various types of springs industrial sewing machines material handling systems wide format digital printing equipment other products for factory automation the primary customers for these products are bedding manufacturers 
we also design and produce some of these specialized products for our own use 

table of contents key strategies in our automotive group  we plan to continue the focus on research and development  looking for ways to improve the function and cost of our products 
the introduction of new capabilities and products creates the potential for us to expand into new markets 
growing our global presence to serve developing markets and to expand our sourcing options will remain a key objective  as will assisting our customers with vendor consolidation to reduce the complexity and cost of their supply chain 
our machinery group designs and manufactures equipment that is used to produce the proprietary innersprings we develop for our bedding customers 
in most cases  this equipment is not available in the marketplace 
providing proprietary machinery is a critical function of our machinery group  and a key factor contributing to the success of our bedding operations 
in addition  we will continue striving to develop technology to improve efficiency in our own plants as well as those of our customers 
acquisitions our typical acquisition is a small  private  profitable  entrepreneurial company 
our acquisition targets are generally complementary to our existing businesses 
over the past ten years  the average acquisition target has had annual revenues between and million  which we believe makes the risk from any single acquisition low 
in our history  we have completed only four acquisitions of businesses with annual sales greater than million 
we do not follow a fixed timetable for buying companies 
rather  we aim to be opportunistic by taking advantage of circumstances as they arise 
as a result  the pace and size of acquisitions in any given year could be significantly more or less than the average over the longer term 
in total  we acquired nine businesses during representing approximately million in annualized sales 
the acquired businesses are expected to add annualized sales within our segments as follows residential furnishings million commercial fixturing components million specialized products million for further information on acquisitions and divestitures  see note b and note n of the notes to consolidated financial statements

foreign operations the percentages of our trade sales from products manufactured outside the united states for the previous three years are shown in the table below 
year percent the majority of our international operations  measured by trade sales  are in canada  europe and mexico 
the canadian operations manufacture products including innersprings for mattresses  fabricated wire for the bedding  furniture and automotive industries  and cut to size bed frame lumber 
we manufacture shelving for 
table of contents retailers  wire and steel storage systems and racks for the interior of service vans and utility vehicles  and point of purchase displays for retailers  as well as chair frames and bases  table bases and office chair controls  and plastic injection moldings 
we also make lumbar supports for automotive seats 
our operations in europe produce  among other things  innersprings for mattresses  structural fabric for industrial and residential uses  various wire products  office chair mechanisms and automotive lumbar seating systems 
we also sell machinery and equipment designed to manufacture innersprings for mattresses and other bedding related components 
finally  we have one operation in europe that designs and distributes point of purchase displays for retailers 
the mexican operations manufacture products including innersprings and wire grid tops for mattresses  fabricated wire for the bedding industry  and structural fabric for industrial and residential uses 
we produce aluminum die castings and provide machining  sub assembly and other value added services related to aluminum die castings 
we also produce commercial shelving  material handling equipment  and automotive control cable systems 
we have an increasing asian presence 
prior to  we owned three production facilities in china 
two of these plants produce mattress innersprings for sale into the chinese market 
the third plant produces machinery and replacement parts for machines used in the bedding industry 
in  we began operations in our fourth plant  a facility to manufacture recliner mechanisms and various bases for upholstered furniture 
this plant primarily sells products to furniture manufacturers in china who produce upholstered furniture for export and to some leggett operations on an inter company basis 
with this facility we are also positioned to supply growing demand in the local market 
in  we added four additional operations in china 
one facility produces small electric motors primarily used in lumbar systems for automotive seating 
another manufactures cables for these lumbar systems 
a third produces innersprings for mattresses and sofa cushions  while the fourth facility manufactures innersprings and bedding machinery 
we also purchased an assembler and distributor of automotive lumbar supports and seat suspension grids in south korea 
finally  our ornamental bed unit imports finished beds from asia for sale in the united states 
our fixture display group also sources certain shelving and racks from chinese suppliers 
many other business units of the company have long standing  well established relationships with suppliers in asia for components and finished products 
our strategy regarding international expansion is to locate our operations where demand for components is growing 
as our customers move the production of their finished products overseas  we need to be located nearby to supply them efficiently 
in addition  these operations should allow us to supply growing demand in the local markets 
our international operations face the risks associated with any operation in a foreign state 
these risks include the nationalization of private enterprises political instability in certain countries differences in foreign laws that make it difficult to protect intellectual property and enforce contract rights credit risks increased costs due to tariffs  customs and shipping rates potential problems obtaining raw materials  and disruptions related to the availability of electricity and transportation during times of crisis or war foreign currency fluctuation 
table of contents such risks could result in increases in costs  reduction in profits  the inability to do business and other adverse effects on the company s business

sales by product line the following table shows the approximate percentages of our sales to external customers by product line for the last three years product line bedding components residential furniture components finished consumer products other residential furnishing products store displays  fixtures storage products office furnishings plastic components aluminum products wire  wire products steel tubing automotive products specialized machinery 
table of contents distribution of products our products are sold and distributed primarily through the company s sales personnel 
however  many of our businesses have relationships and agreements with sales representatives and distributors 
we do not believe any of these agreements or relationships would  if terminated  have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the company 
raw materials we use a variety of raw materials in manufacturing our products 
some of the most important raw materials include steel scrap steel rod coil and sheet steel angle iron aluminum rough green lumber woven and non woven fabrics textile scrap foam chemicals and foam scrap plastic resin the raw materials for many of our businesses are supplied by our own facilities 
for example  steel rod is used to produce steel wire  which we use to make innersprings and box springs for mattresses  displays  shelving and racks for retail customers  and automotive seating components 
our own wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our requirements for steel wire 
the steel rod produced at our rod mill supplies roughly half of our current rod requirements 
we also produce welded steel tubing and dimension lumber both for our own consumption and for sale to customers outside the company 
we believe that worldwide supply sources are available for all the raw materials used by the company 
however  we have experienced higher raw material costs most notably steel during the past two years 
we purchase about million tons of steel annually  accounting for approximately of our cost of goods sold 
in  inflation caused the company to pay over million more for steel than it did in most steel vendors rescinded previous contracts  and moved to day pricing 
the company announced or implemented steel related price increases in most segments 
although the company anticipates the costs for steel to stabilize  the future pricing of steel is uncertain and could increase in even beyond current levels 
the degree to which we are able to mitigate or recover these escalating costs  should they occur  is likely to be a significant factor influencing earnings 
customers we serve thousands of customers worldwide  sustaining many long term business relationships 
no customer accounted for more than five percent of the company s consolidated revenues in our top ten customers accounted for less than nineteen percent of the company s consolidated revenues in the commercial fixturing components segment has one customer that accounted for approximately of the segment s sales 
aluminum products has two customers  one of which accounted for approximately and another that accounted for approximately of the segment s sales 
the specialized products segment has three customers which accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the segment s sales 
the loss of any one of these customers may have a material adverse effect upon the relevant segment 

table of contents patents and trademarks leggett holds approximately  patents and has approximately in process for its various product lines 
we have registered over trademarks  with more than in process 
no single patent or group of patents  or trademark or group of trademarks  is material to our business as a whole 
most of our patents and trademarks relate to products sold in the specialized products and residential furnishings segments 
examples of our most significant trademarks include semi flex  lok fast and dyna lock boxspring components and foundations mira coil  lura flex and superlastic mattress innersprings nova bond and rollout insulators for mattresses adjustamagic adjustable electric beds wallhugger recliner chairs super sagless motion and sofa sleeper mechanisms no sag sinuous wire tack jump and patternlink quilting machines hanes fiber materials schukra  pullmaflex and flex o lators automotive products masterack  amco and rhc spacemaster fixtures and displays spuhl mattress innerspring manufacturing machines gribetz and porter quilting and sewing manufacturing machines research and development we maintain research  engineering and testing centers in carthage  missouri  and also do research and development work at many of our other facilities 
we are unable to precisely calculate the cost of research and development because the personnel involved in product and machinery development also spend portions of their time in other areas 
however  we believe the cost of research and development was approximately million in  million in and million in employees we have approximately  active employees  of which approximately  are engaged in production 
of the total active employees  roughly  are international employees 
approximately of our employees are represented by labor unions 
we did not experience any material work stoppage related to the negotiation of contracts with labor unions during management is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to the negotiation of contracts with labor unions during the largest group of employees  approximately  works in the residential furnishings segment 
approximately  employees work in commercial fixturing components  while approximately  employees work in specialized products 
roughly  work in the aluminum products segment and approximately  are employed by our industrial materials segment 
competition many companies offer products that compete with those manufactured and sold by leggett 
the number of competing companies varies by product line  but the markets for our products are highly competitive in all aspects 
a number of our customers manufacture components similar to ours for their own use 
the primary competitive factors in our business include price  product quality  innovation  and customer service 
in certain of our markets a portion of us manufacturing is moving overseas 
we face increasing price competition from foreign competitors  especially those in asia who supply component parts to our customers 
table of contents chinese and asian manufacturing facilities 
we have  and continue to develop  significant asian supply sources 
we also have  and continue to develop  a manufacturing presence in asia 
our asian facilities manufacture products for asian markets as well as for our customers in other parts of the world 
we believe we are the largest independent manufacturer in north america of the following components for residential furniture and bedding retail store fixtures and point of purchase displays components for office furniture non automotive aluminum die castings drawn steel wire automotive seat support and lumbar systems carpet underlay adjustable beds bedding industry machinery for wire forming  sewing and quilting seasonality the company does not experience significant seasonality  however  quarter to quarter sales have generally varied in proportion to the total year by about 
the timing of acquisitions and economic factors in any year can distort the underlying seasonality in certain of our businesses 
nevertheless  for the company as a whole  the second and third quarters typically have proportionately greater sales  while the first and fourth quarters are generally lower 
residential furnishings typically has the strongest sales in the second and third quarters due to increased consumer demand for bedding and furniture during the late summer and fall months 
commercial fixturing and components generally has heavy third quarter sales of its store fixture products  with the first and fourth quarters normally lower 
this aligns with the industry s normal construction cycle  and the opening of new stores and completion of remodeling projects in advance of the holiday season 
aluminum products sales are proportionately greater in the first two calendar quarters due to typically stronger spring and early summer demand for barbeque grills and lawn and garden equipment 
industrial materials sales peak in the third and fourth quarters from higher demand for bedding products and seasonal demand for wire ties used for baling cotton which is typically harvested in the early fall 
specialized products has relatively little quarter to quarter variation in sales  although the automotive business is somewhat heavier in the second and fourth quarters of the year and somewhat lower in the third quarter  due to model changeovers and plant shutdowns in the automobile industry during the summer 
backlog our relationships with our customers and our manufacturing and inventory practices do not provide for a significant backlog of orders 
production and inventory levels are geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and projections of future demand based on customer relationships

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
introduction what we do leggett platt is a fortune diversified manufacturer that conceives  designs  and produces a broad range of engineered components and products that can be found in most homes  retail stores  offices  and automobiles 
we make components that are often hidden within  but integral to  our customers products 
we are north america s leading independent manufacturer of components for residential furniture and bedding  adjustable beds  carpet underlay  retail store fixtures and point of purchase displays  components for office furniture  non automotive aluminum die castings  drawn steel wire  automotive seat support and lumbar systems  and machinery used by the bedding industry for wire forming  sewing  and quilting 
our segments our year old company is composed of business units under five reportable segments  with approximately  employee partners  and more than facilities located in over countries around the world 
our five segments are residential furnishings  commercial fixturing components  aluminum products  industrial materials  and specialized products 
residential furnishings  our largest segment  generated of the company s total sales in the operations in this segment supply a variety of components mainly used by bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers in the assembly of their finished products 
we also sell adjustable beds  bed frames  ornamental beds  carpet cushion  and other finished products 
in  commercial fixturing components contributed of total sales 
operations in this segment produce a store fixtures  point of purchase displays  and storage products used by retailers  b chair controls  bases  and other components for office furniture manufacturers  and c injection molded plastic components used in a variety of end products 
aluminum products represented of s total sales 
we are north america s leading independent producer of non automotive aluminum die castings 
our operations serve a diverse group of customers that manufacture products including motorcycles  diesel and small engines  outdoor lighting fixtures  gas barbeque grills  appliances  power tools  and consumer electronics  among others 
industrial materials generated of our total sales in these operations primarily supply steel rod  drawn steel wire  and welded steel tubing to other leggett operations and to external customers 
our wire and tubing is used to make bedding  furniture  automotive seats  retail store fixtures and displays  mechanical springs  and many other end products 
specialized products contributed of s total sales 
from this segment we supply lumbar systems and wire components used by automotive seating manufacturers 
we also design and produce machinery  both for our own use and for others  including bedding manufacturers 
customers we serve a broad suite of customers with no single customer representing even of our sales 
many are firms whose names are widely recognized  they include most manufacturers of furniture  bedding  and automobiles  most major retailers  and a variety of other manufacturers 
our products are primarily sold through our own sales employees 
however  some of our businesses also use independent sales representatives and distributors 

table of contents competition we believe we gain our competitive advantage through many key attributes  including low cost operations  internal production of key raw materials  manufacturing expertise  product innovation  high quality products  focus on customer service  long lived relationships with customers  and financial strength 
many companies offer products that compete with those we make 
the number of competitors varies by product line they tend to be smaller  private companies  but most of our markets are very competitive 
we face increasing competition from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their finished product from asia 
we are establishing operations in asia to continue supplying those customers 
at the end of  leggett operated eight chinese facilities 
although we can generally produce components at a lower cost in the us  as our customers move the production of their finished products overseas  we must be located nearby to supply them efficiently 
many of our competitors  both domestic and foreign  compete primarily on the basis of price 
we are also price competitive  but we focus to a greater degree on product quality  innovation  and customer service 
major factors that impact our business same location sales growth should be a primary driver of future earnings 
our operating performance is heavily influenced by market demand for our components and products 
this demand is impacted by many broad economic factors  including consumer sentiment  employment levels  housing turnover  and interest rates 
these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods  and therefore drive demand for our components and products 
we are also impacted by trends in business capital spending  approximately one quarter of our sales relates to this segment of the economy 
raw material cost trends can also significantly impact earnings 
steel is our largest raw material  representing approximately of our cost of goods sold 
as progressed  the price of certain types of steel nearly doubled  but we were able to recover most of our higher costs through selling price increases 
although we expect costs to stabilize  unanticipated large changes could significantly affect earnings 
our ability to recover additional cost increases  should they occur  is a major factor that could impact future results 
unprecedented price increases in the steel market during led to an above average scrap to rod market price spread 
this market spread benefited our earnings through our steel rod mill  however  we believe this spread is not sustainable long term 
inflation in other raw materials can also impact operations 
those major materials include chemicals  fibers  and resins all of which are generally impacted by changes in oil prices  and lumber 
aluminum is also a significant material used in our operations  but our earnings exposure to this commodity is partially mitigated by pricing arrangements we have with our customers 
in october  we announced increased attention to our poorly performing fixture display operations 
this tactical plan was aimed at accomplishing improved operating efficiency  better adherence to standard costs  tighter inventory control  cost reduction  and more competent staffing 
we made progress under the tactical plan in as discussed later in this md a 
still  there is more work to be done to reach our targeted margins for this business 
the success of the plan could have a significant impact on future operating results 
as we expand internationally  our exposure to foreign currencies grows 
significant changes in the exchange rates of the us dollar to foreign currencies impact our results 
in our md a  we discussed availability of steel as a potential issue impacting our business 
as progressed  worldwide demand for steel moderated slightly and worldwide supply increased as new mills particularly in china were brought on line 
heading into  we believe availability of steel is no longer as large an issue in the market 
in addition  we believe we are better positioned than our competitors to secure supply due to our internal production of key raw materials  financial strength  and purchasing leverage 

table of contents in last year s md a  we also discussed uncertainty regarding natural gas prices 
although still at higher than historical levels  energy costs were relatively stable in we continue to monitor pricing and have locked in prices on a small amount of our natural gas requirements for the next three years 
results of operations vs 
sales in exceeded our prior record by  and earnings increased substantially 
margins also improved for the full year 
during the year  we were challenged by rapidly escalating steel costs  but we were successful in recovering most of the higher costs through selling price increases 
our steel rod mill operated at full capacity for the year  and this brought significant earnings benefits 
improved performance of our fixture display operations also contributed to our earnings growth 
further details about these items and our consolidated and segment results are discussed below 
consolidated results the following table shows the changes in sales and earnings from to and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes dollar amounts in millions net sales year ended december  acquisition sales growth same location sales growth year ended december  net earnings year ended december  increased sales  operating improvements  and other gains from asset sales lower inventory obsolescence lower tax rate weaker us dollar higher restructuring costs year ended december  we set a record for sales in at billion  up from same location sales increased from the combined effect of inflation  unit volume growth  and currency rate changes 
approximately two thirds of the organic growth came from inflation as we implemented price increases to pass along higher raw material costs 
unit volumes improved in many businesses  but gains were strongest in upholstered furniture components  carpet underlay  aluminum components  and machinery 
for the year  world wide bedding units were roughly flat 
volume declined slightly in our fixture display operations 
currency rate changes also added to same location sales growth  but to a much lesser extent than inflation and unit volume gains 
rising steel costs were our largest challenge in we purchase roughly million tons of steel each year  accounting for approximately of our cost of goods sold 
during  prices increased significantly  and for the year we paid over million more for steel than in due to the magnitude of these increases  we were compelled to pass along our higher costs 
in addition to steel  we experienced inflation in other raw materials during chemical  fiber  and resin costs increased as oil prices rose 
aluminum costs also increased  but our earnings exposure to this commodity is currently limited by the pricing arrangements we have with our customers 

table of contents net earnings grew  to million  and earnings per share increased  to  from in several factors contributed to the earnings improvement sales increase higher sales were the primary factor contributing to s earnings growth 
unit volume gains led to improved overhead absorption in many of our businesses 
in addition  prior years plant consolidations and cost cutting helped lower our fixed costs and allowed us to utilize capacity more efficiently as volume increased 
selling and administrative expenses increased at a slightly slower rate than sales  also benefiting earnings 
gains from our steel rod mill earnings benefited in from full production at our steel rod mill 
efficiency improved significantly year over year  since we were ramping up production in in addition  we benefited from an above average scrap to rod price spread 
improvements in our fixture display operations steps taken under the fixture display tactical plan contributed to the earnings growth we saw in earnings also benefited from gains on sales of buildings no longer used in operations  lower inventory obsolescence  and a lower income tax rate 
the income tax rate fell from in to in  due to our mix of domestic and foreign income and certain one time factors 
these improvements were partially offset by impacts from a weaker us dollar and slightly higher restructuring costs 
further weakening of the us dollar in impacted certain of our canadian operations that sell in us dollars but incur their costs in canadian dollars 
these operations experienced margin deterioration in segment results residential furnishings sales in residential furnishings increased  or million in same location sales grew  with more than half coming from inflation 
acquisitions added the remaining 
unit volume gains were strongest in upholstered furniture components and carpet underlay  but these improvements were mitigated slightly by approximately flat world wide bedding demand 
our furniture components businesses have performed well for the past three years  and in  posted double digit  world wide unit sales growth in mechanisms for upholstered furniture 
we sell to nearly all manufacturers of motion upholstered furniture 
these customers include major public furniture producers as well as smaller privately owned manufacturers 
our international presence and depth of product line allow us to efficiently supply upholstered furniture manufacturers in many parts of the world 
we benefit from world wide demand  since our components are used in furniture produced not only in north america  but also in europe and asia 
we ve also benefited from an industry trend to incorporate high quality motion features into more lines of furniture 
our continuing strong performance results from growing share with domestic producers and a well established international presence 
world wide demand for bedding components was strong in early  but moderated in the second and third quarters  and declined in the fourth quarter primarily from weakness in the us market 
we believe that reduced advertising expenditures by bedding manufacturers during the fourth quarter led to less promotion by retailers and  in turn  lower demand for bedding 
in early  most bedding manufacturers implemented price increases to recover the higher costs they were absorbing late in these recoveries should allow the manufacturers to return to normal levels of promotion in  and therefore we expect demand to improve 
earnings before interest and taxes ebit grew or million in segment ebit margins improved to  versus in earnings gains came from sales growth  which resulted in higher utilization rates and improved overhead absorption in certain businesses 
table of contents prior cost reduction and plant consolidation efforts selling price increases  primarily to recover escalating steel costs  and gains from the sale of buildings no longer used in operations these improvements were partially offset by higher raw material costs  the impact of a weaker us dollar primarily versus the canadian dollar  and modest restructuring charges 
commercial fixturing components for the full year  sales grew  or million  with acquisitions accounting for the bulk of the increase 
same location sales increased  as inflation more than offset a unit volume decline 
slight unit declines in our fixture display operations were partially offset by mid single digit unit growth in our office furniture components businesses 
continued weak demand for store fixtures reflects reluctance on the part of many retailers to increase capital spending on construction of new stores and renovation of existing stores 
gains in office furniture components volume continue a trend of stable to improving market conditions 
ebit more than doubled  from million in to million in segment ebit margins improved to  versus in earnings gains came from benefits from fixture display tactical plan  including cost savings and improved operational efficiency non recurrence of s inventory write downs higher sales in our office furniture components businesses  and gains from the sale of buildings no longer used in operations these items were partially offset by higher raw material costs  currency rate impacts  and modest restructuring charges 
aluminum products in  sales grew  or million  solely from organic growth 
unit volume gains contributed three quarters of the improvement 
during the past year  sales benefited from new programs for producers of motorcycles  small engines  and large appliances  among others 
much of this segment s growth over the past few years has come through continued effort to increase market share 
these gains should continue to occur as we increase volume with existing customers  target customers who currently make their own components  and expand into new markets where die cast components are used 
a recent example of this continued growth is a new arrangement with briggs stratton to supply aluminum castings to their assembly plant in auburn  al 
production is expected to begin in late ebit increased or million in segment ebit margins improved to  versus in earnings gains from higher sales were partially offset by inflation in aluminum costs 
industrial materials sales in industrial materials increased or million in  almost entirely due to inflation 
unit volumes were up modestly in the first three quarters  but declined in the fourth quarter from weaker bedding demand 
for the full year  volume was essentially flat 
ebit increased significantly  from million in to million in segment ebit margins improved to  versus in earnings benefited from higher sales  full utilization of the steel rod mill  and an above average scrap to rod price spread which benefited the rod mill 

table of contents specialized products in  sales grew  or million 
same location sales increased  with unit volumes and currency each contributing about half the growth 
acquisitions added the remaining 
our machinery operations posted double digit gains for the full year  as bedding manufacturers increased spending on new equipment 
in addition  we saw modest growth in our automotive businesses  reflecting benefits of new programs and increased product placement 
ebit was down million or in ebit margins decreased to  versus in the earnings decline resulted from currency impacts in certain automotive operations  we incur costs in canadian dollars and sell in us dollars 
the weaker us dollar caused margin declines in these operations 
higher raw material costs due to the longer term supply contracts we have with many automotive customers  we experienced lags in recovering our higher steel costs 
other factors  including restructuring  depreciation  and new product development 
these declines were partially offset by gains from higher sales 
vs 
we made progress in several areas in demand in many of our markets improved as the year progressed 
same location sales recovered from early year declines and finished the year up slightly 
we gained ground on key internal initiatives  most notably  the start up of our rod mill  the addition of five operations in china  and the completion of the fourth largest acquisition in our history 
late in the year  we announced increased attention to our poorly performing fixture display operations 
we were challenged by rapidly rising steel costs  higher energy costs  and a weaker us dollar 
further details about these items and our consolidated and segment results are discussed below 
consolidated results the following table shows the changes in sales and earnings from to and also identifies the major factors contributing to the changes dollar amounts in millions net sales year ended december  acquisition sales growth same location sales growth year ended december  net earnings year ended december  weaker us dollar higher energy costs higher inventory obsolescence lower restructuring costs reduced bad debt expense unabsorbed overhead  operating inefficiency  and increased steel costs year ended december  
table of contents sales increased to billion 
same location sales growth resulted primarily from currency rate changes 
unit volumes for the year were essentially flat 
net earnings decreased  to million 
eps was down  to from in several factors contributed to the earnings decline weakening of the us dollar  primarily against the canadian dollar some of our canadian operations sell in us dollars but incur their costs in canadian dollars 
these operations experienced margin declines in price increases were implemented in some of these operations  but us competitors who were not experiencing this impact made further price increases challenging 
higher energy costs natural gas prices during were higher on average than in reduced overhead absorption weak demand during the first half of led to lower production levels  particularly in our us bedding components and wire drawing operations 
volume improved late in the year  and the earnings impact lessened 
other declines came from unusually high inventory obsolescence  operating inefficiency in certain locations  and increased steel costs 
partially offsetting these negative factors were lower restructuring costs  reduced bad debt expense  and income tax rate reduction 
the income tax rate fell from in to in  primarily from the realization of foreign tax credit carryforwards 
segment results residential furnishings sales increased  or million  with organic growth and acquisitions contributing almost equally 
most operating units experienced a rebound in customer demand in the second half of the year 
full year improvements were reported in several categories  including upholstered furniture components  ornamental and adjustable beds  and carpet underlay 
sales from foreign operations also increased for the year  in part from currency impacts  as foreign currencies now convert to more us dollars 
these gains were partially offset by sales declines in our fiber operations 
sales in our us bedding components businesses also decreased for the full year due to weak demand in early beginning in june  demand improved and our bedding components operations posted growth during the second half of the year 
ebit decreased  or million 
earnings were impacted by a weaker us dollar versus the canadian dollar higher steel and energy costs unabsorbed overhead from lower production at us bedding components operations during the first half of the year  and the non recurrence of a partial reversal of a canadian lumber duty accrual higher sales and lower restructuring costs partially offset these factors 
commercial fixturing components sales grew  or million  primarily from acquisitions 
our july acquisition of rhc spacemaster contributed the majority of this growth 
same location sales were down slightly 
although certain major retailers continued with new store openings and refurbishments in  most retailers limited their capital spending during the year 
demand for office furniture components also remained at very low levels throughout  but modest improvements began to develop late in the year 
ebit for the segment declined million  or  primarily due to inventory write downs a weaker us dollar versus the canadian dollar 
table of contents higher steel costs price competition  and operational inefficiency in certain operations in the third quarter of  we announced a focused management effort to improve the operating efficiency and margins of the fixture display portion of this segment 
as previously discussed  progress was made under that tactical plan during lower restructuring costs offset some of these negative factors 
aluminum products sales decreased million or 
three divestitures reduced sales by million  but same location sales gains of offset some of this decline 
no acquisitions were made during new programs for castings used in motorcycles  small engines  and large appliances represented the majority of the same location sales increase 
these gains were partially offset by a decline in sales of barbeque grill castings 
ebit increased million  or  primarily due to same location sales growth 
lower restructuring and non recurring charges benefited ebit by approximately million  but were partially offset by an unfavorable change in sales mix 
industrial materials sales were down  or million  reflecting lower same location sales 
this decline resulted from weakness in many of our end markets  including wire demand from bedding manufacturers in the first half of  and tubing demand for atv s and accessories 
certain markets began to recover late in the year and volumes improved  particularly in the wire drawing operations 
ebit fell  or million  due to lower sales and production volume  and higher steel and energy costs 
these factors were partially offset by the non recurrence of start up costs associated with the steel rod mill  lower restructuring charges  and a gain from the sale of a tubing fabrication business 
specialized products sales grew  or million  largely from a gain in same location sales 
new automotive programs  increased shipments of bedding machinery during the second half of  and currency rates positively impacted sales 
ebit was up slightly  as the effects of higher sales were offset by impacts from the weaker u 
s dollar  sales mix  and other smaller factors 
cash flow and capitalization our priorities for use of cash  in order of importance  are fund internal growth and acquisitions extend our track record of annual dividend increases use remaining cash if any to repurchase stock over the last three years we used approximately million in cash each year to fund these priorities 
in round figures  approximately was used for capital expenditures  for funding annual dividends  for acquisitions  and for stock repurchases 

table of contents our primary source of cash is internal operations 
over the last three years cash from operations was more than adequate to fund the items mentioned above 
when proceeds from asset sales are included  we generated sufficient cash over the last three years to reduce net debt by over million 
long term debt as a percent of total capitalization net of cash and current maturities of debt declined from at the end of to at the end of over the next few years  we plan to gradually increase net debt as a percent of total capitalization back toward our long term target of  while maintaining our longstanding single a debt rating 
we see benefit to modestly increasing debt  and little risk given our competitive position and consistently strong cash flow 
additional detail on a the uses of cash  b operating cash flow  and c debt position and total capitalization is provided below 
cash flow uses of cash capital expenditures in totaled million  up from million in and million in we make these investments to modernize  maintain  and expand manufacturing capacity 
in  we expect capital spending to approximate million  with the increase related primarily to a few major expansion projects 
acquisition spending totaled million in  down from million in and in line with s total of million 
in  we purchased nine companies that should add about million to annual revenues 
in residential furnishings  we acquired three businesses with total sales of approximately million 
the largest with sales of about million designs and produces comforters  decorative pillows  and other top of bed accessories 
in commercial fixturing components  we added three operations with sales that total about million 
two of these operations with sales of about million produce injection molded plastic components used primarily in office furniture 
the remaining three businesses should add approximately million in sales to our specialized products segment 
the largest of the three has annual revenues of about million and makes tubing and wire products used primarily in automotive seating 
additional details of acquisitions are discussed in note b to the financial statements 
we paid cash dividends of million  million  and million during   and  respectively 
over the past three years  dividends have increased at a compounded annual rate 
our long term target for dividend payout is approximately one third of the prior three years average earnings 
calculated in the same manner as our target  dividend payout was in  in  and in as earnings grow  we expect to move back toward the payout target 
repurchases of common stock net of issuances totaled million in  million in  and million in these purchases were made primarily to replace shares issued in employee stock plans 
as mentioned earlier  we expect to gradually increase net debt back to our long standing target of of total capitalization 
as this occurs  additional cash will be available 
we plan to use this cash and cash from operations  primarily to finance growth and extend our record of annual dividend increases 
remaining cash should go toward repurchasing stock 
the amount available to repurchase shares will fluctuate each year with earnings  capital spending  and the pace of acquisitions 
although no specific schedule has been established  we have been authorized by the board of directors to repurchase up to million shares each year beginning january  this authorization was granted at the august  board of directors meeting and replaced all previous stock repurchase authorizations 

table of contents operating cash flow cash flow from operations is our primary source of funds  and totaled million  million  and million for   and this past year  cash flow from operations benefited from stronger earnings  but was reduced overall by an increase in working capital 
accounts receivable and inventory balances increased in  primarily from inflation and currency impacts 
these increases were partially offset by higher accounts payable and other current liabilities  also the result of inflation and currency 
in and  operating cash was relatively strong despite weak earnings  in part due to our ability to reduce working capital 
working capital levels vary by segment  with aluminum products and commercial fixturing components requirements generally higher than company averages 
accounts receivable balances in these segments are typically higher due to the longer credit and collection time required to service certain customers of the aluminum die casting and fixture display businesses 
these same businesses also require higher inventory investments due to the custom nature of their products  longer manufacturing lead times in certain cases  and the needs of many customers to receive large volumes of product within short periods of time 
capitalization the table below presents key debt and capitalization statistics at the end of the three most recent years 
dollar amounts in millions long term debt outstanding scheduled maturities average interest rates average maturities in years revolving credit commercial paper total long term debt deferred income taxes and other liabilities shareholders equity total capitalization unused committed credit long term short term total unused committed credit current maturities of long term debt cash and cash equivalents ratio of earnings to fixed charges x x x fixed charges include interest expense  capitalized interest  and implied interest included in operating leases 

table of contents the next table shows the calculation of long term debt as a percent of total capitalization  net of cash and current maturities  at december  and we believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities more appropriately reflects financial leverage  since cash is readily available to repay debt 
these adjustments also enable meaningful comparisons to historical periods 
prior to  current debt maturities and cash balances were much smaller 
dollar amounts in millions long term debt current debt maturities cash and cash equivalents net debt  after adjustments total capitalization current debt maturities cash and cash equivalents total capitalization  after adjustments debt to total capitalization before adjustments after adjustments total debt including long term debt and current debt maturities increased million in during the year we repaid million of debt that came due  and in november  we issued million of year notes at a coupon rate 
with this issuance  we took advantage of current interest rates and locked in another portion of long term debt 
in the past two years  we ve issued million of fixed rate debt with an average remaining life of just over years  and an average coupon rate of about 
in february  we repaid million of medium term notes that came due 
most of our debt has a fixed repayment date 
at the end of  this debt consisted primarily of medium term notes 
our public debt currently carries a moody s rating of a and a standard poor s rating of a 
we have maintained a single a rating on our debt for over a decade 
we can also raise cash by issuing up to million in commercial paper through a program that is backed by million in revolving credit 
we believe we have sufficient availability of funds to support our ongoing operations and take advantage of growth opportunities 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our future contractual obligations and commitments total payments due by period after years contractual obligations less than year years years dollar amounts in millions long term debt capitalized leases operating leases purchase obligations interest payments other obligations total contractual cash obligations long term debt excludes million of market value adjustments related to interest rate swap agreements on notes that mature in the long term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if we were not able to make the principal and interest payments when due 
purchase obligations primarily include open short term days purchase orders that arise in the normal course of operating our facilities 
interest payments are calculated on debt outstanding at december  at rates in effect at the end of the year 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we make many critical estimates when preparing financial statements  these are discussed below 
the first group of comments addresses major estimates that impact our earnings each year  and later  we identify and discuss those estimates that impact earnings less frequently 
for more information regarding our significant accounting policies  please refer to note a to the financial statements 
the most critical estimates impacting our ongoing results relate to credit losses costs related to pension  worker s compensation  automobile  product and general liability  property  and medical programs inventory losses from obsolescence income taxes with respect to credit losses  our customers are diverse  but many are small to medium sized companies and some are highly leveraged 
bankruptcy can occur with some of these customers relatively quickly and with little warning  particularly in a changing economic environment  adding to the difficulty in estimating credit losses 
worker s compensation  automobile  product and general liability  property  and medical insurance costs may require an extended period after the actual loss occurred before the exact amount of the cost is known 
estimates of these costs over that period  which in some cases is several years  will vary from the final amount 
changing customer specifications  technology  customer bankruptcy and other factors result in inventory losses that are difficult to estimate precisely 
at any financial statement date  the impact of these factors on inventory value may not be completely known 
income taxes are recorded at rates in effect in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
we have tax loss carryforwards in certain jurisdictions 
valuation reserves are established against these future potential tax benefits based on our estimate of their ultimate realization 
actual realization of these benefits may vary from these estimates 
also  certain assumptions have been made about the distribution of earnings from subsidiaries which may not be accurate in the future  thereby affecting the tax impact of such earnings 
finally  ultimate resolution of issues raised by ongoing tax audits is not predictable and could affect our tax liabilities 
our accounting estimates of these costs and losses are based on actuarial estimates  prior experience  current trends and or specific information regarding relevant events or transactions 
we believe our reserves for these potential losses are adequate 
the next group of comments addresses estimates that may occasionally impact our earnings 
the most significant of these estimates relate to goodwill and asset impairments  and unusual litigation and claims 
losses related to these items are recognized when specific facts which affect the estimate are known 
goodwill impairment is formally assessed on an annual basis  as required by sfas no 
 and also when we experience significant negative deviations from the assumptions underlying the fair market valuation of each reporting unit 
asset impairments are monitored by periodically focusing on underperforming locations that have insufficient cash flows 
many assumptions about the future are necessary in the determination of fair market value for each of our ten reporting units as defined by sfas no 

the key assumptions are discount rate  organic sales growth  margins  capital expenditure requirements  and working capital requirements 
no goodwill impairment has been determined to date for any of our reporting units 
the key assumptions are re evaluated annually  or more frequently if significant changes become apparent  using our most recent assessment of the performance potential of each reporting unit 
recent performance of the reporting unit is an important factor  but not the only factor  in the annual assessment 
fair market values calculated for each reporting unit may go up or down each year based on a re evaluation of the key assumptions 

table of contents our fixture display operations have experienced deterioration of profitability in recent years due to external market factors and unsatisfactory internal performance 
late in  we responded with a tactical plan which has already been discussed in this md a 
about million of goodwill is associated with these operations 
although we made progress in  margins must continue to improve in order to avoid possible future impairment of this goodwill 
we have not recorded any significant losses for litigation and claims in the last three years  and we are not aware of any significant unrecorded exposures 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
 share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas r clarifies and expands statement s guidance in several areas  including recognizing share based compensation cost  measuring fair value  classifying an award as equity or as a liability  and attributing compensation cost to reporting periods 
sfas r is effective for leggett platt beginning with the first day of our fiscal third quarter july  and applies to all awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled on or after that date 
we adopted  as of january   the provisions of statement as originally issued and  as such  have evaluated sfas no 
r and believe it will not have a material impact on our financial reporting and disclosures 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
this statement revises the criteria used to determine whether nonmonetary exchanges are measured based on the recorded amounts of the assets exchanged or on their fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june   and is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial reporting and disclosures 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
amends prior guidance to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of freight  handling cost and wasted material 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial reporting and disclosures 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb staff positions fas and fas  providing guidance regarding certain accounting and reporting issues associated with the american jobs creation act of fasb staff position has not had  nor is it expected to have  a material impact on our financial reporting or disclosures 
regarding fas  the company is still in the process of evaluating the effects of the repatriation provision of the american jobs creation act and expects to complete that evaluation by december  to date  the company has not remitted any amounts under the repatriation provision 
currently  the related range of income tax effects of such a repatriation cannot be reasonably estimated 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk unaudited dollar amounts in millions interest rates the table below provides information about the company s debt sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the company has no other significant financial instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates 
substantially all of the debt shown in the table is denominated in united states dollars 
during  of fixed rate debt maturing in february was issued and converted to variable rate debt by use of an interest rate swap agreement 
this swap agreement  which contains the same payment date as the original issue  was used primarily 
table of contents to manage the fixed variable interest rate mix of its debt portfolio 
in march  the company sold its rights under the agreement for  which is being amortized over the remaining period of the related debt 
the fair value of fixed rate debt was calculated using the us treasury bond rate as of december  and december  for similar remaining maturities  plus an estimated spread over such treasury securities representing the company s interest costs under its medium term note program 
the fair value of fixed rate debt was greater than its carrying value by and at december  and  respectively

exchange rates the company does not hedge all net foreign currency exposures related to transactions denominated in other than its associated functional currencies 
the company may occasionally hedge firm specific commitments or other anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
the decision by management to hedge any such transactions is made on a case by case basis 
the amount of forward contracts outstanding at december  was approximately pay usd receive mxn  pay gbp receive usd 
the highest amount during was approximately pay usd receive mxn  pay gbp receive usd 
in  these contracts were primarily used to reduce volatility from usd raw materials purchases for certain uk subsidiaries and to hedge about of expected mexican peso needs for the company views its investment in foreign subsidiaries as a long term commitment  and  except for the cross currency swap agreement disclosed below  does not hedge translation exposures 
the investment in a foreign subsidiary may take the form of either permanent capital or notes 
the company s net investment in foreign subsidiaries subject to translation exposure at december is as follows functional currency canadian dollar european currencies mexican peso other total cross currency swap agreement in december  the company entered into a million swiss francs chf five year cross currency rate swap agreement with wachovia bank  na this agreement is designated as a net investment hedge 
the purpose of this swap is to hedge chf denominated assets  thereby reducing exposure to volatility in the exchange rate 
in addition  the terms of this agreement include that the company will receive interest on usd at a fixed rate of and pay interest on million chf at a fixed rate of 

table of contents during  the company paid interest of on the chf portion and received interest of on the usd portion of the agreement 
at december   the unrealized loss on the cross currency swap was approximately commodity prices other than for planned purchases of natural gas  the company does not generally use derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposures to changes in commodity prices 
in august  the company entered into fixed price swap agreements to hedge portions of its anticipated purchases of natural gas 
the company hedged approximately of its anticipated natural gas consumption for the month period beginning in september  of its anticipated consumption for the month period beginning september  and of its anticipated consumption for the month period beginning september approximately of natural gas contracts were outstanding as of december  through december   there was no significant gain or loss  realized or unrealized  on these contracts
