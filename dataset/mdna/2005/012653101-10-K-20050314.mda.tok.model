the dispute arises out of a stock purchase agreement between a predecessor to albemarle overseas development and a predecessor to aventis under which of the stock of potasse et produits chimiques  sa  now known as albemarle ppc  was acquired by albemarle overseas development 
the dispute relates to a chemical facility in thann  france owned by albemarle ppc 
under the terms of the agreement  we believe that aventis is obligated to indemnify albemarle overseas development and albemarle ppc  and hold them harmless from certain claims  losses  damages  costs or any other present or prospective liabilities arising out of soil and groundwater contamination at the site in thann 
beginning in may  the french government  with respect to the management of pollution risk on the site of active industrial installations  required albemarle ppc to conduct an environmental risk study of the thann facility 
in june  the french government directed albemarle ppc to undertake a more detailed risk study of groundwater contamination 
the administrative process of the french government is still ongoing as of the present date 
albemarle overseas development has demanded indemnification from aventis for the cost of the studies  but aventis has refused to pay 
the request for arbitration requests indemnification of albemarle overseas development by aventis for all costs incurred by albemarle ppc in connection with any environmental claims of the french government for the albemarle ppc facility and a declaratory judgment as to the liability of aventis under the agreement for costs to be incurred in the future by albemarle ppc in connection with such claims 
arbitration related to the question of liability is currently scheduled for june at this time  it is not possible to predict what the french government will require with respect to the thann facility  since this matter is in its initial stages and environmental matters are subject to many uncertainties 
we believe  however  that we are entitled to be fully indemnified by aventis for all liabilities arising from this matter but no assurance can be given that we will prevail in this matter 
if we do not prevail in the arbitration and the government requires additional remediation  the costs of remediation could be significant 
on june   we initiated a petition for breach of contract and declaratory judgment against amerisure insurance company and amerisure mutual insurance company f k a michigan mutual insurance company in the nineteenth judicial district court  parish of baton rouge  louisiana on the grounds of the defendants refusal to honor their respective obligations under certain insurance policies on which we were named an additional insured to reimburse us for certain damages incurred by us in the discontinuance of product support for and the withdrawal from a water treatment venture 
this proceeding has been removed to united states district court for the middle district of louisiana where it is currently pending 
we have also initiated formal discussions related to such damages with our primary general commercial liability carrier 
no assurance can be given that we will prevail in this matter 
in addition  we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings of types regarded as common in our businesses  particularly administrative or judicial proceedings seeking remediation under environmental laws  such as superfund  products liability and premises liability litigation 
we maintain a financial accrual for these proceedings that includes defense costs and potential damages  as estimated by our general counsel 
we also maintain insurance to mitigate certain of such risks

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december   and on july   we acquired the refinery catalysts business of akzo nobel nv refinery catalysts business 
following this acquisition  we restated our financial statements to reflect the realignment of our polyolefin catalysts business from our polymer chemicals segment  which we renamed polymer additives  to our new catalysts operating segment 
the polymer additives and catalysts operating segment data herein are recast for net sales  operating profit and identifiable assets for each of the years ended december  and to reflect the realignment 
after the realignment  the polymer additives operating segment is comprised of the flame retardants and stabilizers and additives product areas 
the catalysts operating segment is comprised of the refinery catalysts and polyolefin catalysts product areas 
the fine chemicals operating segment is comprised of the performance chemicals  pharmachemicals  agrichemicals  and fine chemistry services and intermediates product areas 
in addition  we restated our financial statements for the year ended december  to move the recognition of revenue of a fourth quarter transaction from december  results to the first quarter and second quarter of a discussion of consolidated financial condition and sources of additional capital is included under a separate heading financial condition and liquidity on page forward looking statements some of the information presented in this form k  including the documents incorporated by reference  may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements are based on our current expectations  which are in turn based on assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on our albemarle corporation and subsidiaries current knowledge of our business and operations 
we have used words such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  intend  may  should  will and variations of such words and similar expressions to identify such forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions  which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control

we assume no obligation to provide revisions to any forward looking statements should circumstances change  except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws 
the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading global developer  manufacturer and marketer of highly engineered specialty chemicals 
our products and services enhance the value of our customers end products by improving performance  providing essential product attributes  lowering cost and simplifying processing 
we sell a highly diversified mix of products to a wide range of customers  including manufacturers of consumer electronics  building and construction materials  automotive parts  packaging  pharmachemicals and agrichemicals  and petroleum refiners 
we believe that our commercial and geographic diversity  technical expertise  flexible  low cost global manufacturing base  and experienced management team enable us to maintain leading market positions in those areas of the specialty chemicals industry in which we operate 
growth of our polymer additives segment is expected to be derived from increasing demand for electrical and electronic equipment  new construction and increasingly stringent fire safety regulations in many countries around the world 
growth in our catalysts segment is expected to be driven by increasing demand for petroleum products  generally deteriorating quality of crude oil feedstock and implementation of more stringent fuel quality requirements as a part of anti pollution initiatives 
the fine chemicals segment continues to benefit from the continued rapid pace of innovation and the introduction of new products  coupled with a movement by pharmaceutical companies to outsource certain research  product development and manufacturing functions 
acquisition of the refinery catalysts business on july   we acquired the refinery catalysts business of akzo nobel nv for approximately million including expenses at applicable exchange rates 
in the fourth quarter of  we adjusted the purchase price by approximately million due primarily to a payment to akzo nobel as part of the post closing working capital adjustments 
we believe that this acquisition significantly enhances our business by giving us a strong new operating segment 
following this acquisition  we transferred our albemarle corporation and subsidiaries existing polyolefin catalysts business from our polymer chemicals segment  which we renamed polymer additives  to a newly created catalysts segment  which also includes the assets we acquired from akzo nobel 
our operations are now managed and reported as three operating segments polymer additives  catalysts  and fine chemicals 
under the terms of the sale agreement  we acquired two wholly owned subsidiaries of akzo nobel one in the united states and one in the netherlands  sales  marketing  intellectual property and other assets used in the acquired business  and interests in three different joint ventures f brica carioca de catalisadores sa  a brazilian joint venture  nippon ketjen co  ltd  a japanese joint venture  and eurecat sa  a french joint venture with affiliates in the united states  saudi arabia and italy 
as part of the acquisition  we also agreed to assume the liabilities of the two acquired subsidiaries and certain liabilities of akzo nobel and its affiliates related to the acquired business 
we retained substantially all employees of the acquired business  including all of the incumbent managers 
the sale agreement provides for a working capital adjustment based on the acquired business working capital on july   as compared to a baseline working capital previously agreed upon by the parties 
in the fourth quarter of  we adjusted the purchase price by approximately million due primarily to a payment to akzo nobel as part of the post closing working capital adjustments 
the purchase price allocation is not final at the time of this filing due to working capital and other contractual settlement issues with the seller as well as the establishment of final tangible and intangible asset values under review with third party valuation consultants 
however  we do not expect the final purchase price accounting to differ materially from the amounts reported at december  we expect the major elements of the purchase price allocation to be completed in the first quarter of  with the exception of working capital and other contractual issues  which are subject to final negotiation  and settlement procedures pursuant to the terms of the sale agreement 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into a new senior credit agreement  consisting of a million revolving credit facility and a million five year term loan facility  and a million day loan agreement 
we used the initial borrowings under the new senior credit agreement and the day loan agreement to consummate the acquisition  refinance our then existing credit agreement and pay related fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith 
public offerings of common stock and senior notes on january   we announced concurrent public offerings of  shares of its common stock and million of senior notes 
the common stock offering sale  after the inclusion of  over allotment shares requested and sold by the company s underwriters  totaled  shares  of which an aggregate of  shares were sold by a member of the family of fd gottwald  jr 
and certain affiliates of the family 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of these shares by the selling shareholders 
both offerings closed on january  with a common stock sale price of per share and the sale of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in the senior notes offering at the public offering price of of par 
we used the net proceeds from both offerings of million to repay the million day bridge loan that we incurred in connection with our acquisition of the refinery catalysts business 
outlook the refinery catalysts business acquisition was a significant event in our ten year history 
the refinery catalysts business adds a number of foundation technologies to our portfolio  including hpc catalysts and fcc catalysts  as well as new products targeting the fast growing clean fuels catalysts market 
we expect that sales from innovative products such as these will contribute to our ability to turnover our portfolio of sales from new products roughly every five years 
in  successful execution of our price increase strategies across the majority of our businesses will remain a key focus 
we expect continued pressure from raw material costs in  particularly in bisphenol a  ethylene  olefins  chlorine and caustic and metals  including molybdenum  nickel and cobalt 
based upon the full year forecast  we expect that our raw materials costs will increase approximately to million compared to business fundamentals are strong which should lead to solid cash flow and strong earnings  with increases due in part to our success in increasing prices during the last half of however  we are closely watching leading indicators in the electronics market for signs of a slowdown  which could impact the extent of margin recovery 
in  we launched a three year  million manufacturing cost reduction program to reduce our fixed cost base 
as of fourth quarter  we achieved an annual run rate on savings equivalent to million 
this program is being expanded to include our newly acquired facilities 
albemarle corporation and subsidiaries with the successful completion of the common stock and notes offerings in january  we substantially reduced our debt to capital rate and set interest costs by repaying the million day loan 
at year s end  our debt to capital rate was approximately  and after the common stock and notes offerings  our debt to equity ratio has been reduced to approximately 
we intend to use future free cash flow to continue to reduce debt  targeting a debt to capital rate over the next twelve months 
we will continue to drive our business to generate cash and to further strengthen the balance sheet 
on december   bp announced that it will close its linear alpha olefins plant in pasadena  texas by the end of december according to bp  effective february   it will terminate certain operating and service agreements pursuant to which we provide operating and support services and certain utilities to bp and bp provides operating and support services and certain utilities to us at our facilities in pasadena  texas 
for the year ended december   these agreements resulted in net payments to us from bp of approximately  we are currently negotiating with bp regarding the terms of the termination 
in addition  we are working internally to develop a plan to mitigate the impact of the termination of these agreements 
polymer additives polymer additives experienced the eighth straight quarter of record net sales as a result of continued strong demand in our key markets  with an average growth of approximately per quarter 
our critical areas of focus will be in driving operating margin improvement  executing development business growth plans in china  increasing global flame retardant advocacy  and continuing success in our new product development portfolio 
unless market demand materially declines  we expect to continue our four year growth trend with year over year increases in catalysts during we expect to realize underlying growth in shipments of refinery catalysts and will continue our efforts to improve margins to offset increased raw material cost 
fcc catalysts volumes are expected to experience some temporary softening in early due to seasonal refinery turnarounds  but we may begin to see an impact in the first quarter from our announced price increases 
we are seeing good demand for hpc catalysts in the first quarter  despite the higher prices resulting from raw material inflation 
there are early indications that prices for molybdenum  a key raw material  may stabilize 
as we combine our current polyolefin catalysts business with the acquired refinery catalysts business  we forecast that the catalysts segment will add more than to our legacy net sales level on an annual basis in the major global petroleum refineries continue to prepare for stricter fuel specifications  including the upcoming on road  diesel sulfur specifications that will be implemented in these stricter specifications are leading to new capital expenditures by petroleum refineries to expand hydroprocessing capability while increasing overall demand for high performance catalysts 
the recently announced opening of a specialty zeolite facility in our pasadena  texas complex  which produces a full range of hydrotreating and fcc additives  will allow us to utilize an innovative new process to address the increasing demand for additives that enhance light olefins production and the growing use of gasoline post treatment for sulfur reduction 
fine chemicals during  we expect to see increasingly high asset utilizations and margin improvement in the bromine products area 
critical areas of focus in this segment will continue to be fueling new product growth in life sciences and maximizing our long term bromine franchise value 
new product sales increased in and we expect this trend to continue in the impact of exiting the detergent zeolite business is now fully behind us 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed construction of a new chlorine production unit as part of our jordan bromine company jbc joint venture bromine production plant 
this facility  which is expected to have an annual capacity of approximately  metric tons  should serve to lower raw materials costs and contribute to improved profitability for the venture in albemarle corporation and subsidiaries results of operations net sales

listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be significant in the preparation of the financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate losses for uncollectible accounts based on the aging of receivables and the evaluation of the likelihood of success in collecting the receivables 
we also provide for claims receivables that are subject to legal proceedings 
depreciation 
book depreciation is estimated based upon internal engineering studies  which are conducted periodically 
engineering and manufacturing  with the advice of specific product management  review each project to make sure that assets to be capitalized are depreciated based upon the estimated product life and or individual asset life  whichever is less 
inventory obsolescence 
inventories are viewed on a quarterly basis to determine age  movement and turnover 
reserves are setup periodically based upon estimates to adjust inventory values in line with their net realizable value 
albemarle corporation and subsidiaries recovery of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recovery of our long lived assets on a segment basis by periodically analyzing our operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment 
acquisition accounting 
we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities when allocating the purchase price of an acquisition 
income taxes 
we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets 
legal accruals 
we estimate the amount of potential exposure and anticipated cost to defend that we may incur with respect to litigation  claims and assessments 
performance and life cycle guarantees 
we provide customers certain performance guarantees and life cycle guarantees 
these guarantees entitle the customer to claim compensation if the product does not conform to performance standards originally agreed upon 
performance guarantees relate to minimum technical specifications that products produced with the delivered catalysts must meet  such as yield and product quality 
life cycle guarantees relate to minimum periods for which performance of the delivered catalysts is guaranteed 
when either performance guarantees or life cycle guarantees are contractually agreed upon  an assessment of the appropriate revenue recognition treatment is evaluated 
environmental remediation liabilities 
we estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on site specific facts and circumstances 
cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter  the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan  and the extent of other parties share of responsibility 
actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize sales when the revenue is realized or realizable  and has been earned  in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
we recognize net sales as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer  which usually occurs at the time shipment is made 
the majority of our sales are sold free on board fob shipping point or on an equivalent basis  other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements 
our standard terms of delivery are included in our contracts of sale  order confirmation documents and invoices 
we recognize revenue from services when performance of the services has been completed 
we have a limited amount of consignment sales that are billed to the customer upon monthly notification of amounts used by the customers under these contracts 
claims receivable we record receivables for non trade claims on a case by case basis whenever management deems that the claim for recovery is probable 
recording of such receivables is preceded by the gathering and evaluation of factually supportable evidence and conditions surrounding the claim  and is generally based on application of specific contractual terms with third parties from which the claim arises 
in accordance with us gaap  we evaluate these receivables for collectibility on a regular basis  and we record provisions for uncollectible amounts when subsequent conditions indicate that collection of all or part of the receivable is not probable 
pension plans and other postretirement benefits we follow the guidance of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  when accounting for pension and postretirement benefits 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards 
this delayed recognition of actual results allows for the recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans 
the primary assumptions are as follows discount rate the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits  which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future 
expected return on plan assets we project the future return on plan assets based principally on prior performance 
these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs recorded currently 
albemarle corporation and subsidiaries rate of compensation increase for salary related plans  we project employees annual pay increases  which are used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
rate of increase in the per capita of covered health care benefits we project the expected increases in the cost of covered health care benefits 
during  we made changes to the assumptions related to the discount rate  the rate of compensation increase for salary related plans and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits 
we consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions 
in selecting the discount rate  consideration is given to fixed income security yields  specifically high quality bonds moody s aa corporate bond rate 
at december   the weighted average discount rate was reduced for the plans from to as a result of decreased yields for long term high quality bonds in estimating the expected return on plan assets  we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long term allocation of plan assets to these investments 
at december   the weighted average expected rate of return on pension plan assets was reduced from to and there was no change in the weighted average expected return on other postretirement benefit plan assets 
our us defined benefit plan for non represented employees was closed to new participants effective march  we adopted a defined contribution pension plan for us employees hired after march  in projecting the rate of compensation increase  we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates 
at december  and  the assumed weighted average rate of compensation increase was and  respectively  for the plans 
in selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits  we consider past performance and forecasts of future health care cost trends 
at december   the previously assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for us retirees was decreased 
the assumed health care cost trend rate for for pre coverage was per year  dropping by per year to an ultimate rate of  the trend rate for post coverage was per year  dropping by per year to an ultimate rate of 
the assumed health care cost trend rate for for pre coverage was per year  dropping by per year to an ultimate rate of  the trend rate for post coverage was per year  dropping by per year to an ultimate rate of 
the postretirement medical benefits provided to employees in the netherlands who retire after august includes an assumed increase in benefits of per year 
income taxes deferred income taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of income and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes  using the liability or balance sheet method 
such temporary differences result primarily from differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we are subject to periodic audit of our income tax returns by tax authorities 
in the united states  the irs has completed a review of our income tax returns through the year for the years after  the our income tax returns are either under review or could be subject to review by the irs 
in connection with our ongoing evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act of  at december   we determined that certain of our reported income tax accounts were overstated based on our detailed reviews 
net adjustments to reflect the reviews resulted in an increase in our net income of approximately million for the year ended december  additionally  we determined non profit and loss related differences in our taxable income calculations for certain of our past income tax returns relating mainly to depreciation adjustments recorded for purposes of determining taxable income 
these differences  which amounted to approximately million in deferred income tax liabilities as of december   were apportioned between current income tax payable approximately million and deferred income tax liabilities 
we believe that the increase in our net income of approximately million and this reclassification entry has had an immaterial impact on our reported financial position 
investments we have investments in joint ventures  nonmarketable securities and marketable equity securities 
the majority of our investments are in joint ventures 
since we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of albemarle corporation and subsidiaries these joint ventures  they are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee between and  although other factors  such as representation on the investee s board of directors and the impact of commercial arrangements  are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate 
our shares of the investee s earnings losses are included in the consolidated statement of income as equity in unconsolidated investments 
investments in marketable securities are accounted for as both available for sale securities with changes in fair value included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets and trading equities that are marked to market on a monthly basis through the consolidated statement of income 
joint ventures and nonmarketable securities results for immaterial entities are estimated based upon the overall performance of the entity where financial results are not available on a timely basis 
internal control over financial reporting section of the sarbanes oxley act of sox requires that we make an assertion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting beginning with our annual report on form k 
our independent registered public accounting firm  pricewaterhousecoopers  llp  must attest to management s assertion and provide its assessment on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
in order to make our assertion  we were required to identify material financial and operational processes  document internal controls supporting the financial reporting process and evaluate the design and effectiveness of these controls 
see report of independent registered public accounting firm in part i  item and management s report on internal control over financial reporting part i  item a 
we began preparing for our sox initiative prior to january  we formed a sox team to facilitate ongoing internal control reviews  coordinate the process for these reviews  provide direction to the business groups and corporate staff involved in the initiative and assist in the assessment of internal control over financial reporting 
we formed a steering committee  comprised of personnel from finance and alliances services  to set uniform guiding principles and policies  review the progress of the initiative  direct the efforts of the sox team and update the audit committee of the board of directors on an ongoing basis 
we also retained an accounting firm other than our independent registered public accounting firm to assist us in our compliance with sox the sox effort involved many of our employees around the world  including participation by the business areas and alliance services 
we viewed this evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as more than a regulatory exercise it was an opportunity to assess critically the financial control environment and make it even stronger 
we incurred initial costs associated with our sox initiative in and expect to incur costs in the future  particularly as we coordinate the sox evaluation with other regulatory requirements to review and evaluate the control environment 
management excluded the refinery catalysts business acquired from akzo nobel nv from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of december   because such business was acquired on july  by us in a material purchase business combination 
the refinery catalysts business total assets and total revenues represent approximately and  respectively  of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended december  financial condition and liquidity cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  up million from million at year end cash flows provided from operating activities  which rose for the third straight year  of million  together with approximately billion of proceeds from borrowings and million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options  were used to cover operating activities  make acquisitions totaling million  net of cash acquired  repay debt of million  fund capital expenditures totaling million  pay quarterly dividends to shareholders of million  fund million of realized euro denominated hedging losses and pay million of financing costs associated with the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business  fund investments amounting to million  purchase  shares of our common stock  and increase cash and cash equivalents by million 
cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  down million from million at year end for  cash flows provided from operating activities of million and  together with million of proceeds from borrowings from credit agreements  million of proceeds from the liquidation of a nonmarketable security  and million of existing cash and cash equivalents  were used to cover operating activities in  make three acquisitions totaling million see other recent acquisitions and joint ventures on page for details of the acquisitions  repay debt of million  fund capital expenditures and investments in joint ventures and nonmarketable securities of million and million  respectively  albemarle corporation and subsidiaries pay dividends to common shareholders of million and purchase approximately  shares of our common stock for million 
we anticipate that cash provided from operating activities in the future and borrowings under our new senior credit agreement will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses  satisfy debt service obligations  fund capital expenditures and make dividend payments 
on january   we announced concurrent public offerings of  shares of our common stock and million of senior notes 
the common stock offering sale  after the inclusion of  over allotment shares requested and sold by our underwriters  totaled  shares  of which an aggregate of  shares were sold by a member of the family of fd gottwald  jr 
and certain affiliates of the family 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of these shares by the selling shareholders 
both offerings closed on january  with a common stock sale price of per share and the sale of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in the senior notes offering at the public offering price of of par 
we used the net proceeds from both offerings of million to repay the million day bridge loan that we incurred in connection with its acquisition of the refinery catalysts business 
all of our borrowings under the million revolving credit facility  million five year term loan facility and day loan agreement bear interest at variable rates based on an average libor rate for deposits in the relevant currency plus an applicable rate currently 
the applicable rate is variable based on the rating of our senior unsecured long term debt by standard poors and moody s 
as of december   borrowings under the million revolving credit facility  million five year term loan facility and day loan agreement bore variable interest rates of  and  respectively  per annum 
borrowings under our new senior credit agreement and day loan agreement are conditioned upon compliance with the following financial covenants a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined  must be greater than or equal to as of the end of any fiscal quarter  b consolidated debt to capitalization ratio  as defined  at the end of any fiscal quarter must be less than or equal to i prior to the earlier of a july  and b our first equity issuance subsequent to july   and ii thereafter   c consolidated tangible domestic assets  as defined  must be or greater than or equal to million for us to make investments in entities and enterprises that are organized outside the united states  and d with the exception of liens specified in our new senior credit agreement and the day loan agreement  liens may not attach to assets where the aggregate amount of all indebtedness secured by such liens at any time exceeds of consolidated net worth  as defined in the agreements 
at december   our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio was the noncurrent portion of our long term debt amounted to million at december   compared to million at the end of with the increase being used to acquire the refinery catalysts business 
our long term debt  including the current portion and short term borrowings  as a percentage of total capitalization  amounted to at december  in addition  at december   we had the ability to borrow an additional million under our various credit arrangements

capital expenditures in of million were higher than the level of million 
our capital spending program is expected to be in the million range over the next few years  with expenditures expected to expand capacities at existing facilities to support an expected increase in sales 
capital spending for environmental and safety projects is expected to be somewhat higher in than the current year due to the increase in the number of manufacturing facilities 
we anticipate that future capital spending will be financed primarily with cash flow provided from operations with additional cash needed  if any  provided by borrowings  including borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on the company s specific cash requirements 
on october   we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the sec covering million of securities 
the shelf registration statement will permit us to issue from time to time a range of securities  including common stock  preferred stock and senior and subordinated debt 
in january  we completed concurrent underwritten public offerings of  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share and million aggregate principal amount of albemarle corporation and subsidiaries our senior notes due the offerings resulted in aggregate net proceeds of million 
we used the net proceeds from these offering to retire all of the indebtedness that we incurred under our day loan agreement to finance our acquisition of akzo nobel s refinery catalysts business 
we used the remaining net proceeds from the offerings remaining for general corporate purposes  including debt reduction 
as a result  the amount outstanding under the day loan at december    has been classified as long term debt 
in addition   of this amount has been reflected in the debt maturities as due in  consistent with the senior notes maturity date  and the difference of  has been reflected in the debt maturities as due in  because the proceeds from the stock issuance in january were used to pay down this amount 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding 
the notes will be effectively subordinated to any of our future secured indebtedness and to existing and future indebtedness our subsidiaries

safety and environmental matters we are subject to federal  state  local and foreign requirements regulating the handling  manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies  the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment 
to our knowledge  we are currently complying and expects to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws  regulations  statutes and ordinances 
compliance with existing federal  state  local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have in the future a material effect on earnings or our competitive position  but increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our results 
among other environmental requirements  we are subject to the federal superfund law  and similar state laws  under which we may be designated as a potentially responsible party prp and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites 
management believes that in most cases  our participation is de minimis 
further  almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated  studied and in many cases settled 
in de minimis situations  our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement  enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp  except for remote contingencies 
in other than de minimis prp matters  our records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial 
we accrue and expense our proportionate share of prp costs 
because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters  we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not be material to operations 
our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were approximately million in versus approximately million in and million in  excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures  and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years 
costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities  which at december  totaled approximately million  up million from december  albemarle corporation and subsidiaries we believe that most of the amount we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation matters in excess of the amounts recorded  if any  should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations  but could have a material adverse impact in any particular quarterly reporting period 
capital expenditures for pollution abatement and safety projects  including such costs that are included in other projects  were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
for each of the next few years  capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent regulatory requirements 
management s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollution abatement and safety regulations are subject to i the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations  and ii uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful  or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handing costs  and spoilage 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal which was the criterion specified in arb no 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of production be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no

r  which supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r will be effective as of the beginning of our third quarter  which begins after the effective date of june  sfas no 
r will result in the recognition of additional compensation expense relating to our incentive plans 
the amount at adoption is not expected to be significant 
this revision will require us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
we currently use the intrinsic value method from apb no 
to measure compensation expense for stock based awards to our employees 
under this standard  we generally do not recognize any compensation related to stock option grants for issues under our incentive plans 
under the new rules  we are required to adopt a fair value based method for measuring the compensation expense related to incentive stock awards 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion sfas no 

this statement is effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  this statement amends apb to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have an effect on us 
in december  the fasb issued staff position sfas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp sfas and fasb staff position sfas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp sfas 
the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law on october  the act provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities  which will be phased in from through in return  the act also provides for a two year phase out of the existing extra territorial income exclusion eti for foreign sales that was viewed to be inconsistent with international trade protocols by the european union 
we do not expect the net effect of the phase out of the eti and the phase in of this new deduction to result in a significant impact on the effective tax rate for fiscal years and based on current earnings levels 
in the long term  we expect that the new deduction will result in an increase of the annual effective tax rate by one percentage point based on current earnings levels in the years with a return to near current tax levels in however  due to the complexity of the act  we have entered into contractual arrangements with an external resource to evaluate the overall impact of the act on our earnings forecast 
under the guidance in fsp sfas  the deduction will be treated as a special deduction as described in sfas no 
as such  the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date 
rather  the impact of this deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on our tax return 
the act also creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and  as of today  uncertainty remains as to how to interpret albemarle corporation and subsidiaries numerous provisions in the act 
we are evaluating whether we can take advantage of this one time benefit offered for repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings  and have no basis at this time for projecting any benefits 
risk factors you should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information  including the financial information  contained in this annual report on form k 
our inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy  on a timely basis or at all  could have a material adverse effect on the margins of our products 
in  our raw material and energy costs increased approximately and approximately  respectively  compared to raw material costs and energy costs have continued to increase in the increases are primarily driven by significantly tighter market conditions and major increases in pricing of basic building blocks for our products such as crude oil  chlorine and metals  including molybdenum  which is used in the refinery catalysts business 
we generally attempt to pass changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers  but we may be unable to or be delayed in doing so 
our inability to pass through price increases or any limitation or delay in our passing through price increases could adversely affect our margins 
in addition to raising prices  raw material suppliers may extend lead times or limit supplies 
constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials could disrupt production and adversely affect the performance of our business 
we face competition from other specialty chemical companies  which places downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products 
we operate in a highly competitive marketplace  competing against a number of domestic and foreign specialty chemical producers 
competition is based on several key criteria  including product performance and quality  product price  product availability and security of supply  responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service 
some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources 
these competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do 
as a result  these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry  changes in the prices of raw materials and energy and in general economic conditions 
additionally  competitors pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices  which could affect our margins and profitability adversely 
our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is  and will continue to be  dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume  shifting to higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development 
if we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position  we could lose market share to our competitors 
downturns in our customers cyclical industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability 
downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals will adversely affect our sales 
many of our customers are in industries  including the electronics  building and construction  and automotive industries  that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions 
historically  downturns in general economic conditions have resulted in diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices  and we may experience similar problems in the future 
a decline in economic conditions in our customers cyclical industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our hpc catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals 
our hpc catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products 
the effectiveness of hpc catalysts diminishes with use  requiring the hpc catalysts to be replaced  on average  once every one to three years 
the sales of our hpc catalysts  therefore  are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the hpc catalysts in the processing units 
sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on environmental conditions  such as droughts  which may prevent farming for extended periods 
albemarle corporation and subsidiaries changes in our customers products can reduce the demand for our specialty chemicals 
our specialty chemicals are used for a broad range of applications by our customers 
changes in our customers products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary 
customers may also find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products 
for example  many of our flame retardants are incorporated into resin systems to enhance the flame retardancy of a particular polymer 
should a customer decide to use a different polymer due to price  performance or other considerations  we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer s new requirements 
consequently  it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use 
our business  results of operations  cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products 
our research and development efforts may not succeed and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products 
the specialty chemicals industry is subject to periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements 
in order to maintain our margins and remain competitive  we must successfully develop  manufacture and market new or improved products 
as a result  we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development 
ongoing investments in research and development for future products could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues 
additionally  for any new product program  there is a risk of technical or market failure in which case we may not be able to develop the new commercial products needed to maintain our competitive position or we may need to commit additional resources to new product development programs 
moreover  new products may have lower margins than the products they replace 
we also expect competition to increase as our competitors develop and introduce new and enhanced products 
for example  the fine chemicals segment is experiencing increased competition from large scale producers of pharmachemicals  particularly from asian sources 
in our catalysts segment  our petroleum refinery customers are processing crude oil feedstocks of declining quality  while at the same time operating under increasingly stringent regulations requiring the gasoline  diesel and other fuels they produce to contain fewer impurities  including sulfur 
as a result  our petroleum refining customers are demanding more effective and efficient catalysts products  and the average life cycle for new catalysts products has declined 
as new products enter the market  our products may become obsolete or competitors products may be marketed more effectively than our products 
if we fail to develop new products  maintain or improve our margins with our new products or keep pace with technological developments  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will suffer 
our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
protection of our proprietary processes  methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business 
we generally rely on patent  trade secret  trademark and copyright laws of the united states and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold  as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements  to protect our intellectual property rights 
the patent  trade secret  trademark and copyright laws of some countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies 
additionally  some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and  even if a patent application has been filed  it may not result in an issued patent 
if patents are issued to us  those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 
we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged  invalidated  circumvented or rendered unenforceable 
we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies 
if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others  we may be liable for damages  and we may be required to change our processes  to redesign our products partially or completely  to pay to use the technology of others or to stop using certain technologies or producing the infringing product entirely 
even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit  the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits 
we may not prevail in any intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 
we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise  continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position 
while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property  we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached  that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise 
albemarle corporation and subsidiaries our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside of the united states 
we and our joint ventures currently have production facilities  research and development facilities  and administrative and sales offices located outside the united states  including facilities and offices located in austria  belgium  brazil  france  germany  italy  japan  jordan  the netherlands  the people s republic of china  saudi arabia and the united kingdom 
we expect sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales and the net sales of our joint ventures 
accordingly  our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal  political  social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions 
risks inherent in international operations include the following agreements may be difficult to enforce and receivables difficult to collect  foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income  or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade or investment  including currency exchange controls  foreign operations may experience staffing difficulties and labor disputes  transportation and other shipping costs may increase  foreign governments may nationalize private enterprises  unexpected adverse changes in export duties  quotas and tariffs and difficulties in obtaining export licenses  intellectual property rights may be more difficult to enforce  fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in us dollars of products and services we provide in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency  general economic conditions in the countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our earnings from operations in those countries  our business and profitability in a particular country could be affected by political or economic repercussions on a domestic  country specific or global level from terrorist activities and the response to such activities  unexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements may occur  and compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may be burdensome 
in addition  certain of our joint ventures operate in high risk regions of the world such as the middle east and south america 
unanticipated events  such as geopolitical changes  could result in a write down of our investment in the affected joint venture 
our success as a global business will depend  in part  upon our ability to succeed in differing legal  regulatory  economic  social and political conditions by developing  implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business 
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  which may adversely affect our operating results and net income 
we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate 
the financial condition and results of operations of each foreign operating subsidiary and joint venture are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets and liabilities as foreign assets and liabilities that are translated into us dollars for presentation in our financial statements as well as our net sales  cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses 
the main foreign currencies for which we have exchange rate fluctuation exposure are the european union euro  japanese yen and british pound sterling 
exchange rates albemarle corporation and subsidiaries between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future 
significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currency denominated debt outstanding 
in addition to currency translation risks  we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from the currency in which it receives revenues 
our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks 
we incur substantial costs in order to comply with extensive environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
in the jurisdictions in which we operate  we are subject to numerous federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties 
ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts 
environmental laws have become increasingly strict in recent years 
we expect this trend to continue and anticipate that compliance will continue to require increased capital expenditures and operating costs 
violations of environmental  health and safety laws and regulations may subject us to fines  penalties and other liabilities and may require us to change certain business practices 
if we violate environmental  health and safety laws or regulations  in addition to being required to correct such violations  we can be held liable in administrative  civil or criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions could be imposed that could disrupt or limit our operations 
liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances  as well as personal injury  property damages or natural resource damages arising out of such hazardous substances  may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault  and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved  or even the entire loss 
such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue  including  for example  entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property  as well as entities that currently own or operate such property 
such liabilities can be difficult to identify and the extent of any such liabilities can be difficult to predict 
we use  and in the past have used  hazardous substances at many of our facilities  and we have in the past  and may in the future  be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials and the associated liabilities may be material 
we also have generated  and continue to generate  hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities 
some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that have resulted in site contamination 
we have also given contractual indemnities for environmental conditions relating to facilities we no longer own or operate 
the nature of our business  including historical operations at our current and former facilities  exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production  storage  use  transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment 
additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites  and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable  that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters 
contractual indemnities may be ineffective in protecting us from environmental liabilities 
at several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated  we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators  however  in the event we make a claim  the indemnifier may disagree with us 
in  we commenced an arbitration proceeding against aventis sa concerning its obligations with respect to contamination at our thann  france facility after aventis refused to accept our demands for indemnification under the contract pursuant to which we acquired the facility 
if those who currently or in the future disagree with us about the scope of their indemnity obligations prevail in their interpretation  our accrual and or our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially 
concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation  or reaction in our markets independent of regulation  that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products 
we manufacture a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups 
for example  for many years we have produced methyl bromide  a chemical that is particularly effective as a soil fumigant 
in recent years  the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly  driven by the montreal protocol of and related regulation prompted by findings regarding the chemical s potential to deplete the ozone layer 
the current regulations contemplate completion of the phase out of methyl bromide as a fumigant in  although certain aspects of the phase out have albemarle corporation and subsidiaries been delayed under implementing regulations that permit the use of methyl bromide on a year to year basis until a feasible alternative is available 
in addition  there has been increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups of polybrominated diphenylethers  or pbdes  which are used as flame retardants  in light of concerns about their potential impacts on human health and the environment 
we manufacture decabrom pde  a type of pbde compound 
in  our net sales of decabrom pde were less than of total net sales 
government regulation  if it occurs or studies evaluating the possibility of regulation  even if governmental regulation does not occur  may result in a decline in our net sales of decabrom pde 
we also manufacture naproxen  a bulk active widely used to provide temporary pain relief and fever reduction 
recently  an alzheimer s disease prevention trial being conducted by an arm of the us national institutes of health found that patients taking naproxen had a greater incidence of cardiovascular events  such as heart attack or stroke  than patients taking a placebo 
in  our net sales of naproxen were less than of total net sales 
we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 
our products provide important performance attributes to our customers products 
if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed  a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed 
these risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because  in certain instances  we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees 
a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more customers 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and limit our ability to react to changes in our industry or to implement our strategic initiatives 
in connection with our acquisition of the refinery catalysts business  we entered into a new senior credit agreement  consisting of a million revolving credit facility and a million five year term loan facility  and a million day loan agreement 
we used the initial borrowings under the senior credit agreement and the day loan agreement to consummate the acquisition  refinance our then existing credit agreement and pay fees and expenses in connection therewith 
in addition  on january   we completed the public offering of million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due we used the net proceeds from the senior notes offering together with the net proceeds from a concurrent public offering of  shares of our common stock to retire all of the indebtedness outstanding under our day loan agreement 
as of february   we had total indebtedness of million and we had also guaranteed million of indebtedness incurred by certain of our joint ventures 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you 
for example  it could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes  limit our ability to secure additional financing to implement our strategic initiatives  increase the amount of our interest expense because most of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest  which  if interest rates increase or our credit ratings decline  will result in higher interest expense  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt  restrict us from making strategic acquisitions  introducing new technologies or otherwise exploiting business opportunities  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our existing indebtedness  and albemarle corporation and subsidiaries limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds  dispose of assets or pay cash dividends 
in addition  we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
the terms of the senior credit agreement and the indenture governing the senior notes do not prohibit us from incurring substantial additional indebtedness 
if new debt is added to our current debt levels  the related risks that we now face could intensify 
we will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside our control 
based on an average interest rate of at february  and outstanding borrowings at that date of million  our annual interest expense would be million 
a change of in the interest rate applicable to such borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately million 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations  particularly if currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements are not realized on schedule or at all 
if we are unable to service our debt obligations  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity  reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets or raise additional equity 
we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all  which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations  or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms  could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 
our senior credit agreement and the indenture governing the senior notes contain restrictive covenants 
these covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility 
the failure to comply with the covenants in the senior credit agreement  the indenture governing the senior notes and the agreements governing other indebtedness  including indebtedness incurred in the future  could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a downgrading of the ratings on our debt or an increase in interest rates will cause our debt service obligations to increase 
borrowings under our senior credit agreement bear interest at floating rates 
the rates are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured long term debt by standard poor s ratings services s p and moody s investors services moody s 
s p has rated our senior unsecured long term debt as bbb and moody s has rated our senior unsecured long term debt as baa s p and or moody s may  in the future  downgrade our ratings 
the downgrading of our ratings or an increase in benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of our interest expense on borrowings under our senior credit agreement 
in addition  the downgrading of our ratings could adversely affect our future ability to obtain funding or materially increase the cost of any additional funding 
our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses  any of which could interrupt our production and adversely affect our results of operations 
our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing  storage  handling and transportation  including explosions  fires  inclement weather  natural disasters  mechanical failure  unscheduled downtime  transportation interruptions  remediation  chemical spills  discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks 
these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to  or destruction of  property and equipment and environmental contamination 
in addition  the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals 
accordingly  these hazards  and their consequences could have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole  including our results of operations and cash flows  both during and after the period of operational difficulties 
the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 
we maintain property  business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations  including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered 
we may incur losses beyond the limits  or outside the coverage  of our insurance policies  including liabilities for environmental remediation 
in addition  from time to time  various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on albemarle corporation and subsidiaries commercially acceptable terms or  in some cases  have not been available at all 
in the future  we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels  and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 
we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate the refinery catalysts business or future acquisitions into our business  which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 
as part of our business growth strategy  we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future 
our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources  including available cash and borrowing capacity 
the expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures  the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully  could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 
furthermore  we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 
as described under business acquisition of the refinery catalysts business  we acquired the refinery catalysts business on july  successful integration of this business is important to our future 
the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations 
some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management  unforeseen claims and liabilities  including unexpected environmental exposures  unforeseen adjustments  charges and write offs  problems enforcing the indemnification obligations of sellers of businesses or joint venture partners for claims and liabilities  unexpected losses of customers of  or suppliers to  the acquired business  difficulty in conforming the acquired business standards  processes  procedures and controls with our operations  variability in financial information arising from the implementation of purchase price accounting  inability to coordinate new product and process development  loss of senior managers and other critical personnel and problems with new labor unions  and challenges arising from the increased scope  geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 
we are not required to assess the effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting of the refinery catalysts business until fiscal section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules of the sec promulgated thereunder require issuer annual reports to contain a report of management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and an attestation of the issuer s independent registered public accounting firm as to that management report 
the first management internal controls report  as well as the first auditor attestation of that report  is included in this annual report form k 
the sec has clarified that the staff will not object if management s section report does not cover the internal controls of companies or businesses acquired during the fiscal year of the report where it is not possible for management to conduct a timely assessment following the consummation of the acquisition 
based on the staff s position  we excluded the refinery catalysts business from our section certification for therefore  we will not be required to determine the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting for the refinery catalysts business until we complete our assessment for fiscal albemarle corporation and subsidiaries we may incur significant charges in the event we close all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 
we periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner 
based on our assessments  we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units  move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility  discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 
we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised  we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations 
the closure of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges which could be significant 
if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel  it could have an adverse effect on our business 
the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business 
in addition  because of the specialized and technical nature of our business  our future performance is dependent on the continued service of  and on our ability to attract and retain  qualified management  scientific  technical  marketing and support personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel 
some of our employees are unionized  represented by workers councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the united states 
as of december   we had approximately  employees 
approximately of our  us employees are unionized 
two of our collective bargaining agreements expire in and one expires in in addition  a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the united states 
such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements 
for example  most of our employees in europe are represented by workers councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment  including salaries and benefits and staff changes  and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce 
although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees  a strike  work stoppage or slowdown by our employees or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 
our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations  which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures 
we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future 
the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties 
if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations  the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan 
in that case  our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to increase the level of our commitment to the joint venture 
also  differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues 
if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
although our pension plans are currently adequately funded  events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business 
we have several defined benefit pension plans around the world  including in the united states  the netherlands  germany  japan and belgium  covering most of our employees 
the us plans represent approximately of the total liabilities of the plans worldwide 
we are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries benefit and tax laws 
the amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans actuaries 
during  we made no contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plans 
our us qualified defined benefit pension plans in aggregate were approximately funded on an irs funding basis as of december  and  as a result  there are no required cash contributions to the plans in however  the actual amount of contributions made subsequent to will albemarle corporation and subsidiaries depend upon asset returns  then current interest rates  and a number of other factors 
the amount we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly 
specifically  if year end accumulated obligations exceed assets  we may elect to make a voluntary contribution  over and above the minimum required  in order to avoid additional minimum liability charges to our balance sheet and consequent reductions to shareholders equity 
these contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business 
the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events  including domestic and international terrorist attacks  may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 
chemical related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the united states and throughout the world 
as an acc member company  we have completed vulnerability assessments of our us manufacturing locations and met the requirements of this industry standard 
we have a corporate security standard and audits our facilities for compliance 
recent investments have been made to upgrade site security 
however  federal legislation is under consideration that could impose new site security requirements  specifically on chemical manufacturing facilities  which may increase our overhead expenses 
new federal regulations have already been adopted to increase the security of the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the united states 
we believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered 
we ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous 
bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities like washington  dc could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations 
broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture 
the occurrence of extraordinary events  including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities  cannot be predicted  and their occurrence can be expected to continue to affect negatively the economy in general  and specifically the markets for our products 
the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets  or assets used by us  could include loss of life and property damage 
in addition  available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or  if available  may be prohibitively expensive 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of operations  we are exposed to changes in financial market conditions due to the denomination of its business transactions in diverse foreign currencies and our ongoing manufacturing and funding activities 
as a result  future earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities are subject to market risk 
we have established policies  procedures and internal processes governing our management of uncertain market conditions  and we use both operational and financial market actions in our risk management activities  which include the use of derivative instruments 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we only enter into derivative contracts based on economic analysis of underlying exposures anticipating that adverse impacts on future earnings  cash flows and fair values due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will be offset by the proceeds from and changes in fair value of the derivative instruments 
we do not hedge our exposure to market risks in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings  cash flows and fair values 
short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are primarily due to operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies 
we cover certain known and anticipated operating exposures by using forward contracts 
the primary currencies for which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling and the us dollar in certain of its foreign locations 
in response to the greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods  we have increased the degree of risk management activities to minimize the impact on earnings of future periods 
we manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use  from time to time  of foreign currency forward contracts 
the principal objective of these contracts is to minimize the risks and or costs associated with global operating activities 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  which generally expire within one year  in the regular course of business to assist in managing our exposure against foreign currency fluctuations on sales and intercompany transactions 
the primary method to albemarle corporation and subsidiaries cover foreign currency exposure is to seek a natural hedge  in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures 
in the event a natural hedge is not available  a foreign currency forward contract may be employed to reduce currency exposure 
while these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value  such fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying foreign currency exposures being hedged 
gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized currently in income 
in connection with the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business  we entered into foreign currency forward hedging contracts to partially hedge the purchase price  which was denominated in euros 
as a result  we incurred a net charge of approximately million during the year ended december our financial instruments  subject to foreign currency exchange risk  consist of foreign currency forward contracts 
at december   no such contracts were outstanding 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we manage the worldwide exposure of our interest rate risks and foreign exchange exposure through our regular operations and financing activities 
we intend to use our senior credit agreement as the primary source of financing supplemented by several uncommitted line agreements  which could expose us to changes in interest rates  if various financial covenants are not met 
we manage our ratio of debt to capitalization with the objective of achieving the lowest cost of capital possible 
our raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather  supply conditions  political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors 
historically  we have not used futures  options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures 
however  the refinery catalysts business has used financing arrangements certain of which contain embedded derivatives to provide long term protection against changes in metals prices 
we seek to limit our exposure by entering into long term contracts when available  and we seek price increase limitations through contracts 
due to the increase in our outstanding indebtedness as a result of the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business  we may enter into interest rate swaps  collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into treasury lock agreements t locks with a notional value of million  to fix the yield on the us treasury security used to set the yield for approximately of our january million notes offering 
the t locks have fixed the yield on the us treasury security at approximately 
the value of the t locks will depend on the difference between the yield to maturity of the year us treasury security that has the maturity date most comparable to the maturity date of the notes when issued and the fixed rate of approximately 
the cumulative effect of the t lock agreements currently forecasted to be a charge of million will be amortized over the life of the notes as an adjustment to the interest expense of the notes 
at december   there were unrealized losses of approximately million million after income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
our operations are exposed to market risk from changes in natural gas prices 
we purchase natural gas to meet our production requirements for a portion of our month rolling forecast for north american natural gas requirements by entering into natural gas futures contracts to help mitigate uncertainty and volatility 
our hedge transactions are executed with a major financial institution 
such derivatives are held to secure natural gas at fixed prices and not for trading 
the natural gas contracts qualify as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
and are marked to market
