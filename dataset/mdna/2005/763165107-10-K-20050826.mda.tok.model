at may   the company was not in compliance with its credit agreement covenants with respect to the fixed charge coverage ratio 
on august   the company received a waiver from its lending group for the default and executed an amendment to the credit agreement 
the amendment changed the maximum permitted leverage ratios and the minimum required fixed charge coverage ratios for each of the first three quarters of fiscal to provide the company additional flexibility for these periods 
the company s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  was reduced in the second half of fiscal by restructuring charges  incremental inventory write down charges  and additional sg a spending due to higher costs related to audit  tax  and sarbanes oxley compliance fees  as compared to previous quarters in fiscal as the company continues to align operations with its engineered solutions strategy and improve operating efficiency in fiscal  ebitda may be impacted by additional costs associated with these initiatives

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
table of contents and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding the company s financial position and results of operations 
their application involves more significant judgments and estimates in preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the estimates are influenced by the following considerations continuing credit evaluation of customers financial conditions  aging of receivables  individually and in the aggregate  large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas  collectability and delinquency history by geographic area  and the fact that no single customer accounts for or more of net sales 
material changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments to the allowance affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable 
at may   the balance in the account was million as compared to million at may  impairment of investments the company holds a portfolio of investment securities and periodically assesses its recoverability 
in the event of a decline in fair value of an investment  the judgment is made whether the decline is other than temporary 
management s assessment as to the nature of a decline is largely based on the duration of that market decline  financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer  and the company s cash requirements and intent to hold the investment 
if an investment is impaired and the decline in market value is considered to be other than temporary  an appropriate write down is recorded 
the company recognized investment impairment in fiscal   and of   and  respectively 
inventories in fiscal  the company carried its inventories at the lower of cost or market using the last in  first out lifo method 
effective in fiscal  the north american operations  which represent a majority of its operations and approximately of its inventories  changed from the lifo method to the first in  first out fifo method 
all other inventories were consistently stated at the lower of cost or market using the fifo method 
the company believes the fifo method is preferable in these circumstances because it provides a better matching of revenue and expenses in the company s business environment 
the accounting change was not material to the financial statements for any of the periods  and accordingly  no retroactive restatement of prior years financial statements was made 
provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation  obsolescence  and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future demands  change in the industry  or market conditions differ from management s estimates  additional provisions may be necessary 
the company recorded inventory obsolescence and overstock provisions of million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively  which was included in the cost of products sold 
the provisions were principally for obsolete and slow moving parts 
the parts were written down to estimated realizable value

these policy and procedure changes included increased approval authorization levels for inventory purchases  quarterly quantitative and qualitative inventory aging analysis and review  changes in the budgeting process to establish targets and metrics that relate to its return on assets rather than only a revenue and profit expectation  and realignment of incentive programs in accordance with these targets and metrics 
the company is committed to inventory management as an ongoing process as the business evolves and technology changes 
long lived and intangible assets the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amounts of its long lived assets  including software  property  plant and equipment 
the company assesses in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the possibility of long lived assets being impaired when events trigger the likelihood 
impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount 
if impairment exists  the carrying value of the impaired asset is written down and impairment loss is recorded in operating results 
in assessing the potential impairment of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets  management makes significant estimates and assumptions regarding the discounted future cash flows to determine the fair value of the respective assets on an annual basis 
these estimates and their related assumptions include  but are not limited to  projected future operating results  industry and economy trends  market discount rates  indirect expense allocations  and tax rates 
if these estimates or assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy  company profitability  or market conditions  among other factors  this could adversely affect future goodwill and other intangible assets valuations and result in additional impairment charges 
effective june   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement changed the accounting for goodwill and indefinite lived assets from an amortization approach to an impairment only approach 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 the company recorded a transitional impairment charge during the first quarter of fiscal of million million net of tax  presented as a cumulative effect of accounting change 
the company performed its impairment test during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
the company did not find any indication that additional impairment existed and  therefore  no additional impairment loss was recorded in fiscal warranties the company offers warranties for specific products it manufactures 
the company also provides extended warranties for some products it sells that lengthen the period of coverage specified in the manufacturer s original warranty 
terms generally range from one to three years 
the company estimates the cost to perform under its warranty obligation and recognizes this estimated cost at the time of the related product sale 
the company reports this expense as an element of cost of products sold in its consolidated statement of operations 
each quarter  the company assesses actual warranty costs incurred  on a product by product basis  as compared to its estimated obligation 
the estimates with respect to new products are based generally on knowledge of the manufacturers experience and are extrapolated to reflect the extended warranty period  and are refined each quarter as better information with respect to warranty experience becomes known 
warranty reserves are established for costs that are expected to be incurred after the sale and delivery of products under warranty 
the warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures  historical experience  and other currently available evidence 

table of contents income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  the company could be required to increase its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets resulting in an increase in its effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results 
at may  and may   the company s deferred tax assets related to tax carryforwards were million and million  respectively 
the tax carryforwards are comprised of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credit carryovers 
a majority of the net operating losses and other tax credits can be carried forward for years 
the company has recorded valuation allowances for the majority of its federal deferred tax assets  loss carryforwards  and tax loss carryforwards of certain non us subsidiaries 
the company believes that the deferred tax assets for the remaining tax carryforwards are considered more likely than not to be realizable based on estimates of future taxable income and the implementation of tax planning strategies

table of contents include statements regarding the intent  belief or current expectations of the company  its directors  or its officers with respect to  among other things i trends affecting the company s financial condition or results of operations  ii the company s financing plans  iii the company s business and growth strategies  including potential acquisitions  and iv other plans and objectives for future operations 
investors are cautioned that any such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from those predicted in the forward looking statements or which may be anticipated from historical results or trends 
in addition to the information contained in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission  factors that could affect future performance include  among others  the following the company has had significant operating and net losses in the past and may have future losses 
the company reported net losses of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal and cannot ensure that it will not experience operating losses and net losses in the future 
the company may continue to lose money if its sales do not continue to increase or its expenses are not reduced 
the company cannot predict the extent to which sales will continue to increase across its businesses or how quickly its customers will consume their inventories of the company s products 
the company maintains a significant investment in inventory and has incurred significant charges for inventory obsolescence and overstock  and may incur similar charges in the future 
the company maintains significant inventories in an effort to ensure that customers have a reliable source of supply 
the market for many of its products is characterized by rapid change as a result of the development of new technologies  particularly in the semiconductor markets served by the company s rf and wireless communications group  evolving industry standards  and frequent new product introductions by some of its customers 
the company does not have many long term supply contracts with its customers 
generally  the company s product sales are made on a purchase order basis  which permits its customers to reduce or discontinue their purchases 
if the company fails to anticipate the changing needs of its customers and accurately forecast their requirements  its customers may not continue to place orders with them and the company may accumulate significant inventories of products which it will be unable to sell or return to its vendors  or which may decline in value substantially 
in fiscal  the company recorded a pre tax provision for inventory obsolescence and overstock of million  or million net of tax  due to an industry wide decline in sales  a prolonged recovery period  and changes in its mix of business toward higher technology products  particularly in the telecommunications market 
in fiscal  the company recorded an additional pre tax provision of million  or million net of tax  primarily for inventory obsolescence  overstock  and shrinkage  to write down inventory to net realizable value as it sought to align its inventory and cost structure to then current sales levels amid continued economic slowdown and limited visibility 
while the company did not incur any material provisions for inventory in fiscal  incremental inventory write down charges of million were recorded during fiscal when the company implemented restructuring actions and certain product lines were discontinued 
the company cannot ensure that similar charges will not be incurred in the future 
if the company does not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting  it could be unable to provide timely and reliable financial information 
as disclosed in the company s management s report on internal control over financial reporting in part ii  item a  controls and procedures of this form k  the company had discovered deficiencies  including material weaknesses  in its internal control over financial reporting 
while the company is taking immediate steps to correct its internal control weaknesses  the material weaknesses that have been discovered will not be considered remediated until the new and improved internal controls for a period of time  are tested and it is 
table of contents concluded that such new and improved internal controls are operating effectively 
pending the successful completion of such testing  the company will perform mitigating procedures relating to its internal control weaknesses 
if the company fails to remediate any material weaknesses  the company could be unable to provide timely and reliable financial information  which could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  or financial condition 
furthermore  it is uncertain what impact an adverse opinion or a disclaimed opinion regarding internal controls would have upon the company s stock price or business 
because the company derives a significant portion of its revenue by distributing products designed and manufactured by third parties  it may be unable to anticipate changes in the marketplace and  as a result  could lose market share 
the company s business is driven primarily by customers needs and demands for new products and or enhanced performance  and by the products developed and manufactured by third parties 
because the company distributes products developed and manufactured by third parties  its business would be adversely affected if its suppliers fail to anticipate which products or technologies will gain market acceptance or if it cannot sell these products at competitive prices 
the company cannot be certain that its suppliers will permit the company to distribute their newly developed products  or that such products will meet the company s customers needs and demands 
additionally  because some of the company s principal competitors design and manufacture new technology  those competitors may have a competitive advantage over the company 
to successfully compete  the company must maintain an efficient cost structure  an effective sales and marketing team  and offer additional services that distinguish it from its competitors 
failure to execute these strategies successfully could harm its results of operations 
the company has exposure to economic downturns and operates in cyclical markets 
as a supplier of electronic components and services to a variety of industries  the company can be adversely affected by general economic downturns 
in particular  demand for the products and services of the company s rf and wireless communications group is dependent upon capital spending levels in the telecommunications industry and demand for products and services of its industrial power group is dependent upon capital spending levels in the manufacturing industry  including steel  automotive  textiles  plastics  semiconductors  and broadcast  as well as the transportation industry 
many of its customers delay capital projects during economic downturns 
accordingly  the company s operating results for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period 
the markets served by its businesses have historically experienced downturns in demand that could harm its operating results 
future economic downturns could be triggered by a variety of causes  including outbreaks of hostilities  terrorist actions  or epidemics in the united states or abroad 
the company has significant debt  which could limit its financial resources and ability to compete and may make it more vulnerable to adverse economic events 
at may   the company s total debt was approximately million  including its outstanding convertible debentures and convertible notes 
the company has incurred and will likely continue to incur indebtedness to fund potential future acquisitions  for strategic initiatives  to purchase inventory  and for general corporate purposes 
although the company believes that the cash flow generated by its continuing operations  supplemented as necessary with funds available under credit arrangements is sufficient to meet its repayment obligations for the fiscal year ended june   the company cannot ensure that this will be the case 
however  the company will need to raise additional capital through debt or equity financings  asset sales  or other sources to refinance the remaining million aggregate principal amount of the and convertible debentures by june  as required by its amended credit agreement 
the company s incurrence of additional indebtedness could have important consequences 
for example  it could increase the company s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  
table of contents require the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  engineering efforts  and other general corporate purposes  as well as to pay dividends  limit the company s flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in its business and the industry in which it operates  place the company at a competitive disadvantage relative to its competitors who have less debt  or limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in its indebtedness  the company s ability to borrow additional funds which could affect its ability to make future acquisitions  among other things 
the company s ability to service its debt and meet its other obligations depends on a number of factors beyond its control 
at may   the company s total debt was approximately million  resulting in a debt to equity ratio of  and primarily consisted of million aggregate principal amount of its debentures  which bear interest at a rate of per year payable on june and december and mature on december  the company s amended credit agreement requires refinancing by june   million aggregate principal amount of its debentures  which bear interest at a rate of per year payable on june and december and mature on june  the company s amended credit agreement requires refinancing by june   million aggregate principal amount of its debentures  which bear interest at a rate of per year payable on june and december and mature on december   and million principal amount of indebtedness under the company s credit agreement  which matures on october   bears interest at london interbank offered rate libor  plus a margin varying with certain financial performance criteria 
the interest rate was at may  the debt to equity ratio has been calculated based on the company s balance sheet dated may  the company s ability to service its debt and meet its other obligations as they come due is dependent on its future financial and operating performance 
this performance is subject to various factors  including factors beyond the company s control such as changes in global and regional economic conditions  changes in its industry or the end markets for its products  changes in interest or currency exchange rates  inflation in raw materials  energy and other costs 
although the company believes there is available financing for the remaining million aggregate principal amount of the and convertible debentures due to be refinanced in june according to the company s amended credit agreement based on discussions with various investment banking institutions  the company cannot ensure that it will have the ability to refinance the convertible debentures by june successfully or with favorable commercial terms 
if the company s cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to enable it to service its debt and meet these obligations as they become due  the company could be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets or businesses  limit or discontinue  temporarily or permanently  business plans or operations  obtain additional debt or equity financing  or restructure or refinance debt 

table of contents the company cannot ensure the timing of these actions or the amount of proceeds that could be realized from them 
accordingly  the company cannot ensure that it will be able to meet its debt service and other obligations as they become due or otherwise 
the company s success depends on its executive officers and other key personnel 
the company s future success depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience  and efforts of its executive officers and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of any of its executive officers  particularly edward j 
richardson  its chairman of the board and chief executive officer  or bruce w 
johnson  its president and chief operating officer  could significantly harm its business and results of operations 
the company s future success will also depend on its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  including technical and engineering personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and the company cannot assure investors that it will be successful in retaining or attracting such persons 
the failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could significantly harm its operations 
the company s credit agreement and the indentures for its outstanding debentures impose restrictions with respect to various business matters 
the company s credit agreement contains numerous restrictive covenants that limit the discretion of management with respect to certain business matters 
these covenants place restrictions on  among other things  the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  to create liens or other encumbrances  to pay dividends or make other payments in respect of its shares of common stock and class b common stock  to engage in transactions with affiliates  to make certain payments and investments  to merge or consolidate with another entity  and to repay indebtedness junior to indebtedness under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement also contains a number of financial covenants that require the company to meet certain financial ratios and tests relating to  among other things  tangible net worth  a borrowing base  senior funded debt to cash flow  and annual debt service coverage 
in addition  the indentures for its outstanding debentures contain covenants that limit  among other things  its ability to pay dividends or make other payments in respect of its shares of common stock and class b common stock and merge or consolidate with another entity 
if the company fails to comply with the obligations in the credit agreement and indentures  it could result in an event of default under those agreements 
if an event of default occurs and is not cured or waived  it could result in acceleration of the indebtedness under those agreements  any of which could significantly harm its business and financial condition 
recent changes in accounting standards regarding stock option plans could limit the desirability of granting stock options  which could harm the company s ability to attract and retain employees  and could also negatively impact its results of operations 
on december   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires all companies to treat the fair value of stock options granted to employees as an expense 
as a result of sfas no 
r  the company is required to record compensation expense equal to the fair value of each stock option granted 
this change in accounting standards reduces the attractiveness of granting stock options because of the additional expense associated with these grants  which would negatively impact the company s results of operations 
for example  the company s recorded net loss of million in fiscal would have increased by million  to a net loss of million  and its recorded net income of million in fiscal would have decreased by million  to a net income of million 
nevertheless  stock options are an important employee recruitment and retention tool  and the company may not be able to attract and retain key personnel if it reduces the scope of its employee stock option program 
accordingly  as a result of the requirement to expense stock option grants  the company s future results of operations would be negatively impacted  as would its ability to use stock options as an employee recruitment and retention tool 

table of contents the company faces intense competition in the markets it serves and  if it does not compete effectively  it could significantly harm its operating results 
the company faces substantial competition in its markets 
the company faces competition from hundreds of electronic component distributors of various sizes  locations  and market focuses as well as original equipment manufacturers  in each case for new products and replacement parts 
some of its competitors have significantly greater resources and broader name recognition than it 
as a result  these competitors may be better able to withstand changing conditions within its markets and throughout the economy as a whole 
in addition  new competitors could enter its markets 
engineering capability  vendor representation  and product diversity create segmentation among distributors 
the company s ability to compete successfully will depend on its ability to provide engineered solutions  maintain inventory availability and quality  and provide reliable delivery at competitive prices 
to the extent the company does not keep pace with technological advances or fails to timely respond to changes in competitive factors in its industry  it could lose market share or experience a decline in its revenue and net income 
in addition  gross margins in the businesses in which it competes have declined in recent years due to competitive pressures and may continue to decline 
the company may not be able to continue to make the acquisitions necessary for it to realize its growth strategy or integrate acquisitions successfully 
one of the company s growth strategies is to increase its sales and expand its markets through acquisitions 
since  the company has acquired companies or significant product lines and expects to continue making acquisitions if appropriate opportunities arise in its industry 
the company may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions  obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms  or otherwise complete future acquisitions 
furthermore  the company may compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with companies that have substantially greater resources than it 
following acquisitions  the acquired companies may encounter unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial and managerial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of its existing operations 
if the company is unable to successfully identify acquisition candidates  complete acquisitions  and integrate the acquired businesses with its existing businesses  its business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected and it may not be able to compete effectively within its industry 
if the company does not continue to reduce its costs  it may not be able to compete effectively in its markets 
the success of the company s business depends  in part  on its continuous reduction of costs 
the electronic component industries have historically experienced price erosion and will likely continue to experience such price erosion 
if the company is not able to reduce its costs sufficiently to offset future price erosion  its operating results will be adversely affected 
the company has recently engaged in various cost cutting and other initiatives intended to reduce costs and increase productivity 
in fiscal  the company recorded a million restructuring charge as it eliminated over positions or approximately of its workforce 
the company cannot ensure that it will not incur further charges for restructuring as it continues to seek cost reduction initiatives 
alternatively  the company cannot ensure that it will be able to continue to reduce its costs the company s industrial power group is dependent on a limited number of vendors to supply it with essential products 
electron tubes and certain other products supplied by the company s industrial power group are currently produced by a relatively small number of manufacturers 
the company s future success will depend  in large 
table of contents part  on maintaining current vendor relationships and developing new relationships 
the company believes that vendors supplying products to some of the product lines of its industrial power group are consolidating their distribution relationships or exiting the business 
the five largest suppliers to the industrial power group by percentage of overall industrial power group purchases in fiscal were advanced power technology inc  communications power industries  inc  cornell dubilier electronics  covimag sa  and new japan radio co 
ltd 
these suppliers accounted for approximately of the overall industrial power group purchases in fiscal the loss of one or more of the company s key vendors and the failure to find new vendors could significantly harm its business and results of operations 
the company has in the past and may in the future experience difficulties obtaining certain products in a timely manner 
the inability of suppliers to provide it with the required quantity or quality of products could significantly harm its business 
economic  political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect the company s business 
in fiscal  of the company s sales were made outside the us and of the company s purchases of products were from suppliers located outside the us the company anticipates that it will continue to expand its international operations to the extent that suitable opportunities become available 
accordingly  the company s future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors which are not present for companies with operations and sales solely within the united states  including changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in emerging markets  including the possibility of military action or other hostilities and confiscation of property  increases in trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  changes in tax laws and international tax treaties  restrictions on its ability to repatriate investments and earnings from foreign operations  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  differing labor regulations  differing levels of protection of intellectual property  changes in regulatory requirements  shipping costs and delays  or difficulties in accounts receivable collection 
if any of these risks materialize  the company could face substantial increases in costs  the reduction of profit  and the inability to do business 
the company is exposed to foreign currency risk 
the company expects that international sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of its total sales  which expose it to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
since the revenues and expenses of the company s foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies  exchange rate fluctuations between local currencies and the us dollar subject the company to currency exchange risks with respect to the results of its foreign operations to the extent it were unable to denominate its purchases or sales in us dollars or otherwise shift to its customers or suppliers the risk of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the company currently does not engage in any significant currency hedging transactions 
fluctuations in exchange rates may affect the results of its international operations reported in us dollars and the value of such operations net assets reported in us dollars 
additionally  its competitive position may be affected by the relative strength of the currencies in countries where its products are sold 
the company cannot predict whether foreign currency exchange risks 
table of contents inherent in doing business in foreign countries will have a material adverse effect on its operations and financial results in the future 
because the company generally does not have long term contracts with its vendors  it may experience shortages of products that could harm its business and customer relationships 
the company generally does not have long term contracts or arrangements with any of its vendors that guarantee product availability 
the company cannot ensure that its vendors will meet its future requirements for timely delivery of products of sufficient quality or quantity 
any difficulties in the delivery of products could harm its relationships with customers and cause it to lose orders that could result in a material decrease in its revenues 
further  the company competes against certain of its vendors and its relationship with those vendors could be harmed as a result of this competition 
the company may have underpaid taxes in a foreign country where is has operations 
the company has been informed by one of its foreign subsidiaries that its records may not be adequate to support the taxable revenues and deductions included within income tax returns previously filed 
at this time  the company has not received notification from any tax authority regarding this matter 
the company will continue to investigate this matter and take the appropriate actions necessary to minimize any potential liability 
as of august   the company has not developed or obtained specific and definitive information sufficient to reasonably confirm the existence of a tax liability  determined a reasonable range of a potential liability  or otherwise evaluated any exposure to the company 
although it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure due to the lack of sufficient information  an unfavorable outcome may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management and market sensitive financial instruments the company s foreign denominated assets and liabilities are cash  accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable  and intercompany receivables and payables  primarily in canada and member countries of the european community and  to a lesser extent  in asia pacific and latin america 
the company monitors its foreign exchange exposures and has entered into forward contracts to hedge significant transactions  however  this activity is infrequent 
the company did not enter into any forward contracts in fiscal in fiscal  the company entered into one forward contract with an approximate value of other tools that may be used to manage foreign exchange exposures include the use of currency clauses in sales contracts and the use of local debt to offset asset exposures 
as discussed above  the company s debt financing  in part  varies with market rates exposing the company to the market risk from changes in interest rates 
certain operations  assets and liabilities of the company are denominated in foreign currencies subjecting the company to foreign currency exchange risk 
in order to provide the user of these financial statements guidance regarding the magnitude of these risks  the securities and exchange commission requires the company to provide certain quantitative disclosures based upon hypothetical assumptions 
specifically  these disclosures require the calculation of the effect of a increase in market interest rates and a uniform strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies on the reported net earnings and financial position of the company 
under these assumptions  additional interest expense  tax effected  would have increased the net loss by in fiscal and decreased income by in fiscal these amounts were determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate increase on the company s variable rate outstanding borrowings 

table of contents had the us dollar strengthened against various foreign currencies  sales would have been lower by an estimated million in fiscal and million in fiscal total assets would have declined by million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  while the total liabilities would have decreased by million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these amounts were determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical decrease in average foreign exchange rates against the us dollar on the sales  assets and liabilities of the company s international operations 
the interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in interest rates and exchange rates would likely influence other economic factors 
such factors  which are not readily quantifiable  would likely also affect the company s operations
