also during  we received million and million  net of issuance costs  from the secondary offering of our common stock and from our issuance of series a convertible preferred stock  respectively 
these sources of cash from financing activities were offset by cash payments during of million and million for capitalized loan costs on new debt and early termination fees on debt that we refinanced  respectively 
on january   we redeemed million of our senior subordinated notes  leaving million outstanding after the redemption 
in connection with the redemption we paid bondholders a penalty and accrued interest 
we expect to record a loss on refinancing long term debt of approximately million during the first quarter of we paid the redemption with borrowings under our revolving credit facility of million and the remainder with cash on hand 
we issued million in senior subordinated notes  which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by substantially all of our existing operating subsidiaries  on june  proceeds from the issuance of the senior subordinated notes and the private placement of million in series a convertible preferred stock were used to finance the acquisition of ramsay and pay down the majority of our long term debt 
interest on the senior subordinated notes accrues at the rate of per annum and is payable semi annually in arrears on june and december  commencing on december  the senior subordinated notes will mature on june  on december   we amended and restated our revolving credit facility with bank of america to increase the borrowings available to us to million  extend the term of the agreement until december and lower the applicable interest rate  as defined in the credit agreement

of these shares   were sold through the full exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
we sold  shares for approximately million after underwriting discounts and other issuance costs 
certain shareholders sold  shares in the offering 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling shareholders 
approximately million of the net proceeds were used to pay down borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
on january   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
the swap agreement effectively converts million of fixed rate long term debt to a libor indexed variable rate instrument plus an agreed upon interest rate spread of 
on april   we entered into another interest rate swap agreement 
this swap agreement effectively converts million of fixed rate debt to a libor indexed variable rate instrument plus an agreed upon interest rate spread of 
on november   we borrowed approximately million under a mortgage loan agreement insured by the us department of housing and urban development hud  secured by real estate located at riveredge hospital near chicago  illinois

we believe that our working capital on hand  cash flows from operations and funds available under our revolving line of credit will be sufficient to fund our operating needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the next months 

table of contents in connection with our proposed acquisition of the capital stock of ahs  we anticipate financing the million cash portion of the purchase price with new debt 
we have entered into a commitment letter with citigroup global markets  inc to provide such financing subject to the terms and conditions of such letter 
in addition  we are actively seeking other acquisitions that fit our corporate growth strategy and may acquire additional inpatient psychiatric facilities 
management continually assesses our capital needs and  should the need arise  we will seek additional financing  including debt or equity  to fund potential acquisitions or for other corporate purposes 
in negotiating such financing  there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital on terms satisfactory to us 
failure to obtain additional financing on reasonable terms could have a negative effect on our plans to acquire additional inpatient psychiatric facilities obligations and commitments payments due by period in thousands less than after total year years years years long term debt lease obligations excludes capital lease obligations  which are included in lease obligations 
the fair value of our million senior subordinated notes was approximately million as of december  the carrying value of our other long term debt  including current maturities  of million and million at december  and december   respectively  approximated fair value 
as a result of entering into two interest rate swap agreements during  we effectively had million in variable rate debt outstanding at december  at the december  borrowing level  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would decrease net income and cash flows by approximately  impact of inflation and economic trends although inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations  the health care industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures as are rising supply costs which tend to escalate as vendors pass on the rising costs through price increases 
some of our freestanding owned  leased and managed inpatient behavioral health care facilities we operate are experiencing the effects of the tight labor market  including a shortage of nurses  which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in our salaries  wages and benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate 
although we cannot predict our ability to cover future cost increases  management believes that through adherence to cost containment policies  labor management and reasonable price increases  the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable 
our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing health care to medicare and medicaid patients is limited due to various federal  state and local laws which have been enacted that  in certain cases  limit our ability to increase prices 
in addition  as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures and a continuing industry wide shift of patients into managed care plans  our ability to maintain margins through price increases to non medicare patients is limited 
the behavioral health care industry is typically not directly impacted by periods of recession  erosions of consumer confidence or other general economic trends as most health care services are not considered a component of discretionary spending 
however  our inpatient facilities may be indirectly negatively impacted to the extent such economic conditions result in decreased reimbursements by federal or state governments or managed care payers 
we are not aware of any economic trends that would prevent us from being able to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants and to meet all required obligations and commitments in the near future 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses included in the financial statements 
estimates are based on historical experience and other information currently available  the results of which form the basis of such estimates 
while we believe our estimation processes are reasonable  actual results could differ from our estimates 
the following represent the estimates considered most critical to our operating performance and involve the most subjective and complex assumptions and assessments 
allowance for doubtful accounts our ability to collect outstanding patient receivables from third party payors and receivables due under our inpatient management contracts is critical to our operating performance and cash flows 
the primary collection risk with regard to patient receivables lies with uninsured patient accounts or patient accounts for which primary insurance has paid  but the portion owed by the patient remains outstanding 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based upon the age of the accounts since the patient discharge date 
we continually monitor our accounts receivable 
table of contents balances and utilize cash collection data to support our estimates of the provision for doubtful accounts 
significant changes in payor mix or business office operations could have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
the primary collection risk with regard to receivables due under our inpatient management contracts is attributable to contractual disputes 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts for these receivables based primarily upon the specific identification of potential collection issues 
as with our patient receivables  we continually monitor our accounts receivable balances and utilize cash collection data to support our estimates of the provision for doubtful accounts 
allowances for contractual discounts the medicare and medicaid regulations are complex and various managed care contracts may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms for different types of services provided in our inpatient facilities and cost settlement provisions requiring complex calculations and assumptions subject to interpretation 
we estimate the allowance for contractual discounts on a payor specific basis given our interpretation of the applicable regulations or contract terms 
the services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are often subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates 
additionally  updated regulations and contract renegotiations occur frequently necessitating continual review and assessment of the estimation process by our management 
professional and general liability we are subject to medical malpractice and other lawsuits due to the nature of the services we provide 
due to our acquisition of ramsay  we had two distinct insurance programs that covered our inpatient facilities 
prior to december   all of our inpatient facilities except those acquired from ramsay had professional and general liability insurance in umbrella form for claims in excess of million with an insured limit of million 
for the inpatient facilities acquired from ramsay  we had professional and general liability insurance in umbrella form for claims in excess of  with an insured limit of million 
these plans were combined in to cover all of our operations for professional and general liability in umbrella form for claims in excess of million with an insured limit of million 
the self insured reserves for professional and general liability risks are calculated based on historical claims  demographic factors  industry trends  severity factors  and other actuarial assumptions calculated by an independent third party 
this self insurance reserve is discounted to its present value using a discount rate 
this estimated accrual for professional and general liabilities could be significantly affected should current and future occurrences differ from historical claim trends and expectations 
we have utilized our captive insurance company to manage this additional self insured retention 
while claims are monitored closely when estimating professional and general liability accruals  the complexity of the claims and wide range of potential outcomes often hampers timely adjustments to the assumptions used in these estimates 
income taxes as part of our process for preparing our consolidated financial statements  our management is required to compute income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the current tax benefit or expense of future deductible and taxable temporary differences 
the future deductible and taxable temporary differences are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities which are components of our balance sheet 
management then assesses our ability to realize the deferred tax assets based on reversals of deferred tax liabilities and  if necessary  estimates of future taxable income 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is established when we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
management must also assess the impact of our acquisitions on the realization of deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance to determine if all or a portion of the valuation allowance will be offset by reversing taxable differences or future taxable income of the acquired entity 
to the extent the valuation allowance can be reversed due to the estimated future taxable income of an acquired entity  then our valuation allowance is reduced accordingly as an adjustment to purchase price 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k and other materials we have filed or may file with the securities and exchange commission  as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made  or to be made  by our senior management  contain  or will contain  disclosures that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts and can be identified by the use of words such as may  will  expect  believe  intend  plan  estimate  project  continue  should and other comparable terms 
these forward looking statements are based on the current plans and expectations of management and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including those set forth below  which could significantly affect our current plans and expectations and future financial condition and results 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
stockholders and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on such forward looking statements when evaluating the information presented in our filings and reports 

table of contents while it is not possible to identify all these factors  we continue to face many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those forward looking statements  including potential competition that alters or impedes our acquisition strategy by decreasing our ability to acquire additional inpatient facilities on favorable terms  our ability to improve the operations of acquired inpatient facilities  our ability to maintain favorable and continuing relationships with physicians who use our inpatient facilities  our limited operating history as a public company  our ability to receive timely additional financing on terms acceptable to us to fund our acquisition strategy and capital expenditure needs  including the financing required to complete our acquisition of the capital stock of ahs  risks inherent to the health care industry  including the impact of unforeseen changes in regulation  reimbursement rates from federal and state health care programs or managed care companies and exposure to claims and legal actions by patients and others  our ability to retain key employees who are instrumental to our successful operations  our ability to ensure confidential information is not inappropriately disclosed and that we are in compliance with federal and state health information privacy standards  and our ability to comply with federal and state governmental regulation covering health care related products and services on line  including the regulation of medical devices and the practice of medicine and pharmacology 
in addition  future trends for pricing  margins  revenues and profitability remain difficult to predict in the industries that we serve 
risk factors if we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations  we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 
the health care industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal  state and local government levels relating to  among other things billing for services  relationships with physicians and other referral sources  adequacy of medical care  quality of medical equipment and services  qualifications of medical and support personnel  confidentiality  maintenance and security issues associated with health related information and medical records  licensure  hospital rate or budget review  operating policies and procedures  and addition of facilities and services 
among these laws are the anti kickback statute and the stark law 
these laws impact the relationships that we may have with physicians and other referral sources 
the oig of the hhs has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices that are deemed 
table of contents protected from prosecution under the anti kickback statute 
our current financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources may not qualify for safe harbor protection under the anti kickback statute 
failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement automatically violates the anti kickback statute  but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny 
further  we cannot guarantee that practices that are outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the anti kickback statute 
in order to comply with the stark law  our financial relationships with physicians and their immediate family members must meet an exception 
we have structured our financial arrangements with physicians to comply with the statutory exceptions included in the stark law and subsequent regulations 
however  future stark law regulations may interpret provisions of this law in a manner different from the manner in which we have interpreted them 
we cannot predict the effect such future regulations will have on us 
if we fail to comply with the anti kickback statute  the stark law or other applicable laws and regulations  we could be subjected to penalties  including criminal penalties  civil penalties including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more inpatient facilities  and exclusion of one or more of our inpatient facilities from participation in the medicare  medicaid and other federal and state health care programs 
in addition  if we do not operate our inpatient facilities in accordance with applicable law  our inpatient facilities may lose their licenses or the ability to participate in third party reimbursement programs 
because many of these laws and regulations are relatively new  we do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations 
in the future  different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our inpatient facilities  equipment  personnel  services  capital expenditure programs and operating expenses 
a determination that we have violated these laws  or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these laws  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects and our business reputation could suffer significantly 
in addition  we are unable to predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted 
we may be required to spend substantial amounts to comply with legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to privacy and security of patient health information and standards for electronic transactions 
there are currently numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing patient privacy and security concerns 
in particular  federal regulations issued under the health insurance portability accountability act of contain provisions that have required  and in the future may require  our facilities to implement costly new computer systems and to adopt business procedures designed to protect the privacy and security of each of their patients individually identifiable health and related financial information 
compliance with the privacy regulations was required on april  for most health care organizations  including our inpatient facilities 
the privacy regulations have had a financial impact on the health care industry because they impose extensive new administrative requirements  restrictions on the use and disclosure of individually identifiable patient health and related financial information  provide patients with new rights with respect to their health information and require our inpatient facilities to enter into contracts extending many of the privacy regulation requirements to third parties who perform functions on our behalf involving health information 
on february   hhs issued final security regulations 
compliance with these security regulations is required by april  for most health care organizations  including our inpatient facilities 
these security regulations require our inpatient facilities to implement administrative  physical and technical safeguards to protect the integrity  confidentiality and availability of electronically received  maintained or transmitted patient individually identifiable health and related financial information 
we cannot predict the total financial or other impact of these regulations on our business 
compliance with these regulations requires substantial expenditures  which could negatively impact our financial results 
in addition  our management has spent  and may spend in the future  substantial time and effort on compliance measures 
on august   hhs issued regulations requiring most health care organizations  including our inpatient facilities  to use standard data formats and code sets by october  when electronically transmitting information in connection with several types of transactions  including health claims  health care payment and remittance advice and health claim status transactions 
we have implemented or upgraded computer systems  as appropriate  at our inpatient facilities and at our corporate headquarters to comply with the new transaction and code set regulations 
violations of the privacy  security and transaction regulations could subject our inpatient facilities to civil penalties of up to  per calendar year for each provision contained in the privacy  security and transaction regulations that is violated and criminal penalties of up to  per violation for certain other violations 
since there is no significant history of enforcement efforts by the federal government at this time  it is not possible to ascertain the likelihood of enforcement efforts in connection with these regulations or the potential for fines and penalties which may result from the violation of the regulations 

table of contents other companies within the health care industry continue to be the subject of federal and state investigations  which increases the risk that we may become subject to investigations in the future 
both federal and state government agencies as well as private payors have heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of health care organizations 
these investigations relate to a wide variety of topics  including cost reporting and billing practices  quality of care  financial relationships with referral sources  medical necessity of services provided  and treatment of indigent patients 
the oig and the us department of justice have  from time to time  undertaken national enforcement initiatives that focus on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of abuse 
moreover  health care providers are subject to civil and criminal false claims laws  including the federal false claims act  which allows private parties to bring whistleblower lawsuits against private companies doing business with or receiving reimbursement under federal health care programs 
some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions 
publicity associated with the substantial amounts paid by other health care providers to settle these lawsuits may encourage our current and former employees and other health care providers to bring whistleblower lawsuits 
any investigations of us or our executives or managers could result in significant liabilities or penalties as well as adverse publicity 
as a provider of health care services  we are subject to claims and legal actions by patients and others 
we are subject to medical malpractice and other lawsuits due to the nature of the services we provide 
facilities acquired by us may have unknown or contingent liabilities  including liabilities related to patient care and liabilities for failure to comply with health care laws and regulations  which could result in large claims and significant defense costs 
although we generally seek indemnification covering these matters from prior owners of facilities we acquire  material liabilities for past activities of acquired facilities may exist and such prior owners may not be able to satisfy their indemnification obligations 
we are also susceptible to being named in claims brought related to patient care and other matters at inpatient facilities owned by third parties and operated by us 
to protect ourselves from the cost of these claims  professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance coverage is maintained in amounts and with deductibles common in the industry 
we have professional and general liability insurance in umbrella form for claims in excess of million with an insured limit of million for all of our inpatient facilities 
the self insured reserves for professional and general liability risks are calculated based on historical claims  demographic factors  industry trends  severity factors  and other actuarial assumptions calculated by an independent third party 
the self insured reserve is discounted to its present value using a discount rate 
this estimated accrual for professional and general liabilities could be significantly affected should current and future occurrences differ from historical claim trends and expectations 
we have established a captive insurance company to manage this additional self insured retention 
there are no assurances that our insurance will cover all claims eg  claims for punitive damages or that claims in excess of our insurance coverage will not arise 
a successful lawsuit against us that is not covered by  or is in excess of  our insurance coverage may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
this insurance coverage may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost  especially given the significant increase in insurance premiums generally experienced in the health care industry 
if federal or state health care programs or managed care companies reduce reimbursement rates for services provided  revenues may decline 
a large portion of our revenue comes from the medicare and medicaid programs 
in recent years  federal and state governments have made significant changes in these programs 
on november   cms announced final regulations adopting a prospective payment system for services provided by inpatient behavioral health care hospitals 
inpatient behavioral health care facilities historically have been reimbursed based on reasonable cost  subject to a discharge ceiling 
for cost reporting periods after january   cms will begin to phase in over a three year period a prospective payment system which will pay inpatient behavioral health care facilities a per diem base rate 
during the three year phase in period  cms has agreed to a stop loss provision which will guarantee that a provider will receive at least of the amount it would have been paid under the cost based reimbursement system 

table of contents the per diem base rate will be adjusted by factors that influence the cost of an individual patient s care  such as each patient s diagnosis related group  certain other medical and psychiatric comorbidities ie  other coexisting conditions that may complicate treatment  and age 
the per diem amounts are calculated in part based on national averages  but will be adjusted for specific facility characteristics that increase the cost of patient care 
the base rate per diem is intended to compensate a facility for costs incurred to treat a patient with a particular diagnosis  including nearly all labor and non labor costs of furnishing covered inpatient behavioral health care services as well as routine  ancillary and capital costs 
payment rates for individual inpatient facilities will be adjusted to reflect geographic differences in wages and will allow additional outlier payments for expenses associated with extraordinary cases 
additionally  rural providers will receive an increased payment adjustment 
medicare will pay this per diem amount  as adjusted  regardless of whether it is more or less than a hospital s actual costs 
the per diem will not  however  include the costs of bad debt and certain other costs that are paid separately

gov providers ipfpps for additional information 
future federal and state legislation may reduce the payments we receive for our services 
insurance and managed care companies and other third parties from whom we receive payment are increasingly attempting to control health care costs by requiring that facilities discount their fees in exchange for exclusive or preferred participation in their benefit plans 
this trend may continue and may reduce the payments received by us for our services 
if competition decreases the ability to acquire additional inpatient facilities on favorable terms  we may be unable to execute our acquisition strategy 
competition among hospitals and other health care providers in the united states has intensified in recent years due to cost containment pressures  changing technology  changes in government regulation and reimbursement  changes in practice patterns such as shifting from inpatient to outpatient treatments  the impact of managed care organizations and other factors 
an important part of our business strategy is to acquire inpatient facilities in growing markets 
some inpatient facilities and health care providers that compete with us have greater financial resources and a larger  more experienced development staff focused on identifying and completing acquisitions 
in addition  some competitors are owned by governmental agencies or not for profit corporations supported by endowments and charitable contributions  and can finance capital expenditures on a tax exempt basis 
any or all of these factors may impede our business strategy 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition 
as of december   our total consolidated indebtedness was approximately million 
our indebtedness could have important consequences including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  requiring that a portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest on our debt  thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate requirements  restricting our ability to sell assets  including capital stock of our restricted subsidiaries  merge or consolidate with other entities  and engage in transactions with our affiliates  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate requirements  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the health care industry  restricting our ability or the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less indebtedness 
in connection with our proposed acquisition of the capital stock of ahs  we expect to incur significant additional indebtedness to finance the million cash portion of the purchase price 
if new indebtedness is added to our and our subsidiaries current indebtedness levels  the related risks that we and they now face could intensify 
in addition  our amended and restated credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and tests which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives 
events beyond our control  
table of contents including changes in general business and economic conditions  may affect our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests 
we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios and tests or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet those ratios and tests 
a breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under the amended and restated credit facility and any resulting acceleration thereunder may result in a default under the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes 
if an event of default under our amended and restated credit facility occurs  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
additional financing may be necessary to fund our acquisition program and capital expenditures  and additional financing may not be available when needed 
our acquisition program requires substantial capital resources 
likewise  the operation of existing inpatient facilities requires ongoing capital expenditures for renovation  expansion and the upgrade of equipment and technology 
in connection with our proposed acquisition of the capital stock of ahs  we expect to incur significant additional indebtedness to finance the million cash portion of the purchase price 
we may not receive additional financing on satisfactory terms 
in addition  our level of indebtedness at any time may restrict our ability to borrow additional funds 
if we are not able to obtain financing  then we may not be in a position to consummate acquisitions or undertake capital expenditures 
recently acquired businesses and businesses acquired in the future will expose us to increased operating risks 
we acquired inpatient facilities in and acquired inpatient facilities in in addition  we have entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire all of the capital stock of ahs 
ahs owns and operates  through its subsidiaries  inpatient behavioral health care facilities 
this expansion exposes us to additional business and operating risk and uncertainties  including our ability to effectively manage the expanded activities  our ability to realize our investment in the increased number of inpatient facilities  our exposure to unknown liabilities  and our ability to meet contractual obligations 
if we are unable to manage this expansion efficiently or effectively  or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel to run the expanded operations  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to improve the operations of acquired inpatient facilities  we may be unable to achieve our growth strategy 
we may be unable to maintain or increase the profitability of  or operating cash flows at  any existing hospital or other acquired inpatient facility  effectively integrate the operations of any acquisitions or otherwise achieve the intended benefit of our growth strategy 
to the extent that we are unable to enroll in third party payor plans in a timely manner following an acquisition  we may experience a decrease in cash flow or profitability 
hospital acquisitions generally require a longer period to complete than acquisitions in many other industries and are subject to additional regulatory uncertainty 
many states have adopted legislation regarding the sale or other disposition of facilities operated by not for profit entities 
in other states that do not have specific legislation  the attorneys general have demonstrated an interest in these transactions under their general obligations to protect charitable assets from waste 
these legislative and administrative efforts focus primarily on the appropriate valuation of the assets divested and the use of the proceeds of the sale by the non profit seller 
in addition  the acquisition of facilities in certain states requires advance regulatory approval under certificate of need or state licensure regulatory regimes 
these state level procedures could seriously delay or even prevent us from acquiring inpatient facilities  even after significant transaction costs have been incurred 
we depend on our relationships with physicians who use our inpatient facilities 
our business depends upon the efforts and success of the physicians who provide health care services at our inpatient facilities and the strength of the relationships with these physicians 
our business could be adversely affected if a significant number of physicians or a group of physicians 
table of contents terminate their relationship with  or reduce their use of  our inpatient facilities  fail to maintain acceptable quality of care or to otherwise adhere to professional standards  suffer damage to their reputation  or exit the market entirely 
we depend on our key management personnel 
we are highly dependent on our senior management team  which has many years of experience addressing the broad range of concerns and issues relevant to our business 
our senior management team includes talented managers of our divisions  who have a wealth of experience in all aspects of health care 
we have entered into employment agreements with joey a 
jacobs  chief executive officer  and jack salberg  chief operating officer  which include non competition and non solicitation provisions 
key man life insurance policies are not maintained on any member of senior management other than mr 
jacobs 
the loss of key management or the inability to attract  retain and motivate sufficient numbers of qualified management personnel could have a material adverse effect on us 
failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
each year we are required to document and test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act  which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments 
during the course of our testing we may identify deficiencies that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the sarbanes oxley act for compliance with the requirements of section in addition  if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
our stock price could be volatile 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly in response to various factors  including the proposed acquisition of the capital stock of ahs  problems achieving revenue enhancements and operating efficiencies  actual and estimated earnings and cash flows  quarter to quarter variations in operating results  changes in market conditions in the mental health or behavioral health care industries  changes in general economic conditions  fluctuations in the securities markets in general  operating results differing from analysts estimates  and changes in analysts earnings estimates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
with respect to our interest bearing liabilities  all of our long term debt outstanding at december  was subject to a weighted average fixed interest rate of  not including our interest rate swaps 
at december   we had million in interest rate swaps that effectively changed million of our fixed rate senior subordinated bonds to a variable rate 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would decrease our net income and cash flows by approximately  on an annual basis based upon the borrowing level at december  as discussed above  we do have a million revolving credit facility that is subject to variable interest rates  however  at december   no balance was outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
in the event we draw on our revolving credit facility and interest rates change significantly  we expect management would take actions intended to further mitigate our exposure to such change 
information on quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k under the caption management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations
