item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with the financial statements  including the related notes  and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
see forward looking statements 
overview our business is organized into three segments timber  paper and paperboard  and converted products 
we benefit from significant integration between our business segments 
during fiscal year  our paper and paperboard segment obtained approximately of its wood chips from logs that were harvested from our timberlands and chipped by our chipping operations 
in the same period  our converted products segment effectively obtained approximately of its paper and paperboard requirements from our longview mill  representing approximately of total mill production  either by direct shipment from our mill or from shipments under barter or buy sell agreements 
in addition  our business segments share centralized corporate management  accounting  human resources and information systems support 
our fiscal year ends o n october net sales for individual segments are reported net of intercompany transfers 
segment operating profits reflect allocations of selling  general and administrative expenses on the basis of the relative cost to produce products in each segment 
in the case of intercompany transfers  cost of products sold is based upon transfer pricing policies that we believe assist us in managing and optimizing the consolidated financial performance of our business as a whole 
for example  paperboard supplied from our paper mill and used in our converting operations is assigned a transfer price equal to the paper mill s cost 
paperboard purchased through buy sell agreements is assigned a price equal to the cost from the third party 
see selected segment results below for a more detailed discussion of these arrangements  i ncluding a review of the accounting for the buy sell agreements 
depending on market conditions  our transfer pricing practices may understate or overstate the actual price at which we could have sold those products into the open market or the actual price in the open market at which we could have purchased the raw materials used to produce those products 
as a consequence  these allocations and transfer pricing policies sometimes result in individual segment results that do not reflect the financial performance that would have resulted for a segment operating as a stand alone business 
our timber segment owns and operates timberlands in oregon and washington and produces logs for sale in the domestic and export markets 
during fiscal year  our domestic customers consisted of approximately independent sawmills and plywood plants 
results of operations for our timber segment also include our sawmill 
net sales of our timber segment are primarily affected by housing starts and other construction activity in the domestic and japanese markets 
construction activity is influenced by mortgage interest rates and general economic conditions in those markets 
net sales in this segment are also affected by supply side factors such as government regulation restricting the harvest of timber from public and certain private lands and competition from logs supplied by foreign producers  especially canadian prod ucers 
the strength of the japanese export market can significantly influence the results of our timber segment since our sales into that market tend to be at higher prices than sales into the domestic market 
because all of our sales are us dollar denominated  our export sales are also significantly influenced by the relative strength of the us dollar 
cost of products sold in the timber segment primarily include contract logging expense  the cost of operating our sawmill  and depletion  which is based on the historical cost of timber that is harvested 
our paper and paperboard segment produces a wide variety of paper and paperboard at our longview mill 
we sell our paper and paperboard products to a number of domestic and export customers 
in fiscal year  our converted products segment obtained approximately of our mill s paper and paperboard output either by direct shipment from our mill or from shipments under barter or buy sell agreements 
net sales in the paper and paperboard segment are primarily affected by general economic activity in the united states and southeast asia and the relative strength of the us dollar 
average prices in this segment have been favorably affected by industry capacity rationalization over the last several years 
the demand for certain specialty products manufactured by our paper and paperboard segment tends to be less depend ent on the economic cycles affecting the commodity paper market 
the major component of cost of products sold for the paper and paperboard segment is fiber  which consists primarily of wood chips  but also includes sawdust and recycled materials 
we have invested in processes that allow us to use an increased proportion of sawdust  hardwood chips and recycled materials to reduce our pulp costs in making our paper and paperboard products 
cost of products sold also includes labor  energy and chemicals used in processing 
our converted products segment produces corrugated containers  solid fiber boxes and creative point of purchase displays 
nearly all of our converted products are sold domestically for end uses that include packaging for consumables such as fresh and frozen produce and beverages  as well as for toys  furniture and electronics 
net sales in the converted products segment are primarily affected by general economic activity in the united states 
the primary constituent materials for converted products are paper and paperboard 
our converted products segment obtained approximately of its paper and paperboard requirements from our longview mill  either by direct shipment from our mill or from shipments under barter or buy sell agreements 
cost of products sold also includes energy  labor  ink and glue 
our longview mill contains six steam driven generators and one natural gas fired co generation facility  all of which are capable of producing electrical power 
in the past  we elected  based on the relationship between rates we could obtain for third party sales of electricity and the cost to us of purchasing electricity and natural gas  to sell a significant percentage of the electricity that we generated into the market and to allocate the operating profit from those sales to the paper and paperboard and converted products segments based on the relative cost to produce products in each segment 
the primary contracts pursuant to which we purchased and sold power expired in fiscal year and  under current terms  we have significantly less flexibility in selling and using power generated by our facilities 
during the first fiscal quarter of  we elected to sell electrical power  but we discontinued the sale in january due to poor margins 
we also sold a minor amount of electrical power in the fourth quarter of fiscal year electrical power sales for fiscal year were million producing an operating loss of million 
we allocated the operating loss to our manufacturing segments with a loss of million to the paper and paperboard segment and a loss of million to our converted products segment 
we did not sell any power in fiscal year or our future decisions concerning electrical power generation  including the extent to which we operate our co generation facility  will change from period to period based on market conditions 
we do not expect sales of power to meaningfully contribute to our results in the coming year 
we can curtail the operation of certain of our equipment and facilities from time to time to provide us with flexibility in managing our operations and cost structure 
in order to meet market conditions and to maximize the efficient use of our paper machines  we fully curtailed two of our twelve paper machines for all of fiscal year and three of our twelve paper machines for all of fiscal year and for substantially all of fiscal year after being curtailed for all of  we began operating our paper machine in the third fiscal quarter of to meet increased demand 
given market conditions  we may curtail the operation of certain of our converting facilities if we believe it is advantageous to do so

see selected segment results below 
cost of products sold 
fiscal year cost of products sold was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal year this decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of increased higher margin timber sales  led by log and lumber price increases and a reduction in logging costs of  partially offset by higher depletion cost 
cost of products sold was further favorably impacted by a reduction in energy cost per ton of production at the paper mill of  labor productivity gains as indicated by reductions in total labor hours per ton of production of at the paper mill and in the converting segment 
cost of products sold was negat ively affected by a million decrease in pension income allocated to cost of products sold  a increase in total fiber cost and a million charge for the loss on the sale of our bag plants 
see selected segment results below 
our cost of products sold also includes depreciation  depletion and amortization costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization consist primarily of depreciation of our plant and equipment  the depletion cost of timber harvested and  to a lesser degree  amortization of logging roads 
this expense was million for fiscal year compared with million for fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses 
fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal year fiscal year costs were negatively affected by increases in wages and associated fringes  legal and consulting fees  depreciation and other costs associated with the implementation of our erp system  and a decrease in allocated pension income

selected segment results timber fiscal years ended october percentage increase decrease timber net sales  millions timber operating profit  millions logs  thousands of board feet lumber  thousands of board feet logs  thousand board feet lumber  thousand board feet fiscal year timber net sales were million  compared with million for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to a increase in log volume sold and a increase in log prices  coupled with an increase in lumber prices of and an increase in lumber volume of 
increases in net sales were driven by the continuing strength of the us housing market and favorable harvest conditions 
domestic log price and volume increased and  respectively  in fiscal compared with fiscal fiscal year export sales in the timber segment were million  or  of timber net sales  compared with million  or  for fiscal year the export sales increase was due to a increase in export log prices and a increase in volume 
log export prices continued to benefit from the dollar being relatively weak compared to the yen during the year 
the decline in export sales as a percent of total sales was due to domestic sales growth exceeding export sales growth 
fiscal year timber operating profit was million  compared with million for fiscal year the primary reasons for this increase were the higher log and lumber prices and a decrease in total logging costs  partially offset by a increase in depletion costs due to harvesting from counties with higher depletion rates 
paper and paperboard fiscal years ended october percentage increase decrease paper and paperboard net sales  millions paper and paperboard operating loss  millions paper  tons paperboard  tons paper  ton fob mill equivalent paperboard  ton fob mill equivalent fiscal year paper and paperboard net sales were million  compared with million for fiscal this increase is primarily due to increases in paper and paperboard volume of and  respectively 
paper and paperboard prices remained relatively flat with paper decreasing and paperboard increasing 
domestic paper and paperboard volume was up and  respectively  while domestic prices declined and  respectively  as compared with fiscal the strengthening of the us economy during the fiscal year drove the improved demand 
domestic paperboard average price was affected by proportionately more corrugated medium being sold in fiscal than in fiscal and the addition of roll pulp sold in the export market 
fiscal year export sales in the paper and paperboard segment were million  or of paper and paperboard net sales  compared with million  or  for fiscal year total export paper and paperboard volume was down  with paper volume down and paperboard volume up 
export paper and paperboard prices increased and  respectively  compared to year ago levels  due mainly to the weaker us dollar 
fiscal year paper and paperboard operating loss was million  compared with an operating loss of million for fiscal year the increase in operating loss was primarily the result of low machine operating rates for the first half of fiscal  driving fixed costs per unit up 
in addition  operational problems in the first quarter of fiscal caused productivity to decline 
mill operations did improve steadily throughout the year with the fourth quarter operating at of capacity compared with only for the first quarter of fiscal the mill operated at of capacity during fiscal year compared with during fiscal year operating results were also negatively affected by a increase in total fiber cost  including a increase in occ costs and a increase in wood ch ip cost  and less pension income 
operating results for fiscal were favorably impacted by paper and paperboard volume increases of and  respectively  and improved labor productivity as indicated by a decrease in labor hours per ton of paper and paperboard produced 
operating results were also positively affected by our on going energy conservation efforts and by strategically utilizing our various fuel sources to mitigate increases in fuel costs  particularly natural gas costs  which resulted in a decrease in total energy cost per ton of production 
during fiscal  we restarted our paper machine  leaving two of our least efficient machines fully curtailed to match production with incoming orders 
our bpi initiatives to improve mill optimization  improve customer service  reduce inventories and lower our procurement costs have contributed favorably to the results 
in first fiscal quarter  we renegotiated a long standing barter agreement whereby we swapped equivalent units of paper for paperboard 
the new buy sell agreement provides for our selling paper to the counterparty s converting facilities  and our purchase of paperboard from them for our converting facilities 
under the buy sell agreement  we began recording the sales of paper as sales  which amounted to million in fiscal year and million in the first three quarters of fiscal year effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal and going forward  we are no longer recording these transactions as sales in our financial statements and instead are recording these transactions as an exchange using carryover basis as contemplated by accounting principles board bulletin no

converted products fiscal years ended october percentage increase decrease converted products sales  millions converted products operating loss  millions converted products  tons converted products  ton fiscal year converted products net sales were million compared with million for fiscal year converted products volume increased while average price remained at the levels of fiscal year the increase in volume was primarily the result of improvement in the general domestic economy in the latter part of fiscal converted products price  although flat year over year  increased approximately from the second fiscal quarter low of ton 
the converted products operating loss for fiscal was million  compared with an operating loss of million for fiscal year the first two fiscal quarters of accounted for million of the operating loss for fiscal the increase in operating loss from converted products operations was due mainly to the higher cost of paper and paperboard supplied to our converting operations by the longview mill in the first two fiscal quarters of  and an increased percentage of higher cost paperboard supplied to our converting operations by third party suppliers during fiscal in october  we sold the equipment and working capital of our two paper bag operations for million in cash 
at the same time  we leased a portion of our spanish fork facility to the purchaser  who intends to continue to manufacture bags  and we will continue to supply paper for their operations 
the sale resulted in a million book loss to converted products operating profit 
by selling the two paper bag plants  which accounted for less than of total company sales and less than of converted products sales  we have completely exited a business we consider non core 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year consolidated results net sales 
fiscal year net sales were million compared with million for fiscal year net sales increased as a result of an increase in net sales in our paper and paperboard segment of million  or  partially offset by a decrease in net sales in our timber segment of million  or  a decrease in net sales in our converted segment of million  or  and a decrease of million in net sales of internally generated power to third parties 
see selected segment results below 
cost of products sold 
fiscal year cost of products sold was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal year this decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of an decrease in steam costs resulting from the use of additional low cost biomass fuel  a per unit decrease in natural gas cost  and a per unit decrease in fuel oil cost  partially offset by a per unit increase in cost of electrical power purchased from third parties  and a increase in occ costs 
in addition  cost of goods sold was negatively affected by a million decrease in pension income allocated to cost of products sold to million from milli on in fiscal year average wood chip costs remained level with fiscal our business process improvement initiatives to improve customer service  reduce inventories and lower procurement costs have contributed favorably to cost reductions in fiscal our cost of products sold also includes depreciation  depletion and amortization costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization consist primarily of depreciation of our plant and equipment  the depletion cost of timber harvested and  to a lesser degree  amortization of logging roads 
this expense was million for fiscal year compared with million for fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses 
fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal year fiscal year costs were negatively affected by a million decrease in allocated pension income to million compared with million in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses were favorably impacted by less expense associated with our business process improvement initiative and our enterprise resource planning system

selected segment results timber fiscal years ended october percentage increase decrease timber net sales  millions timber operating profit  millions logs  thousands of board feet lumber  thousands of board feet logs  thousand board feet lumber  thousand board feet fiscal year timber net sales were million  compared with million for fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in log volume sold and a decrease in log prices  partially offset by an increase in lumber prices of and an increase in lumber volume of 
the log volume decline in fiscal year was primarily due to the decision to begin reducing harvest levels from the increased level of fiscal year and harvest restrictions caused by unusually dry weather conditions in the third fiscal quarter as a consequence of the weakening of the us dollar relative to the yen  export prices improved over fiscal  while domestic prices decreased a modest 
fiscal year export sales in the timber segment were million  or  of timber net sales compared with million  or  for fiscal year this decline was a result of decreases in export log volume of and less lumber sold in the export market 
fiscal year timber operating profit was million  compared with million for fiscal year the primary reasons for this decline were the reduced log volume sold  an increase in logging costs  and a increase in depletion costs  due to harvesting from counties with higher depletion rates  partially offset by an increase in average lumber prices and an increase in lumber volume 
paper and paperboard fiscal years ended october percentage increase decrease paper and paperboard net sales  millions paper and paperboard operating loss  millions paper  tons paperboard  tons paper  ton fob mill equivalent paperboard  ton fob mill equivalent fiscal year paper and paperboard net sales were million  compared with million for fiscal this increase is primarily due to a and increase in paperboard volume and price  and a increase in paper volume 
in first fiscal quarter  we renegotiated a long standing barter agreement whereby we swapped equivalent units of paper for paperboard 
the new buy sell agreement provides that we now sell paper to our counterpart s converting facilities  and we now purchase paperboard from them for our midwest converting facilities 
in addition to this new agreement  in the fourth fiscal quarter of  we made a similar change from another barter agreement wherein we now sell paperboard to the counterpart s converting facilities and we now buy paperboard for certain of our convert ing facilities 
as a result of the new agreements  we had a increase in paper and paperboard net sales over fiscal  and a increase in paper and paperboard volume over fiscal see fiscal selected segment results  paper and paperboard segment  for further discussion of accounting for the buy sell agreements 
we continue to maintain our focus on market niches that tend to have higher and more stable sales price dynamics and offer higher value added products for customers  such as our tea kraft semi extensible paper for use in multiwall bags 
demand and pricing improved in fiscal for tea kraft with volume up and sales up over fiscal year fiscal year export sales in the paper and paperboard segment were million  or of paper and paperboard net sales  compared with million  or  for fiscal year export paper and paperboard volume increased and  respectively  and export paper and paperboard prices increased and  respectively  compared to year ago levels 
these volume and price increases are the result of improved demand for our products and the positive pricing benefits of the weaker us dollar 
fiscal year paper and paperboard operating loss was million  compared with an operating loss of million for fiscal year in fiscal year  we allocated losses of million to the segment as a result of power sales  but had no power sales in fiscal year operating results were favorably impacted by a price increase for paperboard of  paper and paperboard volume increases of and  respectively  an decrease in steam costs resulting from the use of additional low cost biomass fuel  a per unit decrease in natural gas cost  and a per unit decrease in fuel oil cost  partially offset by a per unit increase in the cost of electrical power purchased from third parties  a increase in occ costs and less pension income 
average wood chip costs remained level with fiscal year  while labor productivity declined a modest 
the mill operated at of capacity during fiscal year compared with during fiscal year during the year  we continued to fully curtail three of our least efficient machines to match production with incoming orders 
our business process improvement initiatives to improve mill optimization  improve customer service  reduce inventories and lower our procurement costs have contributed favorably to the results 
converted products fiscal years ended october percentage increase decrease converted products sales  millions converted products operating loss  millions converted products  tons converted products  ton fiscal year converted products net sales were million compared with million for fiscal year converted products volume decreased while average price rose modestly 
this reduction in volume was primarily the result of the continued general slowdown in the domestic economy 
fiscal year converted products operating loss was million  compared with an operating loss of million for fiscal year operating results for fiscal year were negatively affected by allocated operating losses from the sale of electrical power of million  compared with no electrical power sales in fiscal year the remaining decrease in operating loss from converted products operations was due mainly to improved productivity measured in production hours per ton of in fiscal year comp ared with fiscal year  and the decrease of in the average mill cost of paper and paperboard supplied to our converting plants  partially offset by the decrease in volume sold and less pension income 
specialty sales  such as bulk bins and four or more color products continue to be an important contributor to the converted products segment of our business  representing of converted products sales for fiscal year and fiscal year fiscal year was favorably impacted by our business process improvement initiatives to improve customer service  reduce inventories  and lower procurement costs 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations was million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year was primarily the result of an increase in working capital caused by the improved level of business activity during the latter part of the year 
the increase in fiscal year was primarily the result of improved management of receivables and inventories and increases in payables 
net cash used for investing was million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year our capital expenditures  including timberland acquisitions  plant and equipment maintenance and improvements and environmental compliance  were million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year during fiscal year  we acquired  acres of timberland in numerous transactions for a total of million  of which the single largest purchase was  acres for million 
capital expenditures for plant and equipment for fiscal year totaled million and focused on meeting customers needs and improving costs 
significant capital expenditures completed in fiscal year include the following new equipment with in line graphics capabilities in our yakima  washington and bowling green  kentucky box plants  upgrades to paper machine to improve the quality of our tea kraft semi extensible paper  an expansion and an upgrade to our old corrugated container occ recycling plant to increase capacity from tons per day to  tons per day  and adding electrostatic precipitators on our hogged fuel boilers to continue to burn less expensive bio mass fuel and meet environmental requirements 
significant capital expenditures completed in fiscal year include the rebuild of paper machine  the rebuild of chemical recovery furnace and modernization of pulp mill controls 
we intend to continue to opportunistically acquire timberlands that are strategic as they become available at acceptable prices reflecting the site  quality of timber and growing stock 
such acquisitions may result in our exceeding our annual capital expenditure expectations  as in fiscal year capital project investments will be focused on high return projects  meeting customers needs  and environmental compliance 
we expect capital expenditures for timber purchases  plant and equipment maintenance and improvements and environmental compliance to total approximately to million for fiscal year net cash used for financing was million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the change for fiscal years  and primarily reflect a million  a million and a million decrease  respectively  in borrowings generally resulting from reduced capital expenditures and dividends compared to earlier years 
due to improved operating performance during the second and third fiscal quarters of fiscal year and favorable market conditions  the company declared and paid a year end dividend of per share in the aggregate amount of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year cash dividends of per share were declared and paid in both the second and third quarters of fiscal year in the aggregate amount of million each 
the resumption of the dividend in the second fiscal quarter of was based on improved operating performance and positive economic conditions that affected our business at the time 
however  economic recovery was slower than expected and to ensure compliance with certain debt covenants  we opted to forego the dividend for the fourth fiscal quarter and the first three quarter s of fiscal year cash dividends of per share were declared and paid in the first fiscal quarter of in the aggregate amount of million 
there were no additional dividends declared or paid in the remainder of fiscal year due to economic conditions that were negatively affecting our business 
our primary financing arrangements restrict the amount of dividends we may declare based on certain financial performance tests 
in the first fiscal quarter  the board of directors declared a per share dividend payable january  dividends are expected to remain at modest levels as the company continues to prioritize the use of excess cash to reduce borrowed debt 
at october   our total borrowed debt was million including long term debt of million  current installments of long term debt of million and short term borrowings of million 
at october   we had million outstanding under our million senior unsecured revolving credit facility  excluding letters of credit of million 
in addition  we had million of senior subordinated notes outstanding 
also outstanding at october   were other various senior notes totaling million  million under an unsecured and uncommitted bank line of credit  and revenue bonds of million 
our financing arrangements require us to be in compliance with certain financial covenants  including minimum net worth  short and long term borrowing ratio  and fixed charge coverage ratio  and restrict our payment of dividends 
the company was in compliance with such covenants at october  we have reduced borrowed debt to million at the end of fiscal year  from million at the end of fiscal year and million at the end of fiscal year our debt peaked at million at january  due to borrowings made in connection with substantial capital expenditures  as well as timberland acquisitions  dividends and stock repurchases in and decreased operating profits in fiscal years and compared with fiscal year we have been able to reduce borrowed debt this fiscal year by million by maintaining a lower level of capital spending on new projects and by improving operating results through the implementation of our business process improvement initiatives and improved market conditions 
in addition  our dividend payouts have been at modest levels while w e prioritize the use of excess cash for debt reduction until operating profits and cash flow return to more acceptable levels 
we expect to continue to reduce debt in fiscal year by continuing to focus on operational improvements and modest levels of capital spending 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we terminated our july fixed to floating interest rate swaps to monetize the gain incurred on the contracts 
the proceeds were used to repay debt and will be recognized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of our senior subordinated notes 
subsequently  we entered into two fixed to floating interest rate swaps for a total of million of the million of our senior subordinated notes 
the purpose of the swaps is to manage our exposure to high fixed rate debt by converting a portion of our outstanding debt from a fixed to a lower variable interest rate 
the new floating rate swaps have rates of approximately 
previously  we had entered into other fixed to floating interest rate swaps that were subsequently terminated to monetize the gain incurred due to lower interest rates and changes in yield 
in these instances  the proceeds were used to repay debt and will be recognized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the senior subordinated notes  which mature in a deferred gain on all the terminated agreements of million is included in other liabilities at october  contractual obligations expressed in thousands fiscal year total beyond long term debt a credit agreement other notes payable reforestation total a fiscal includes the million senior note that was repaid on december  with proceeds from additional borrowing of million under the million revolving credit facility 
environmental regulations will require us to spend million to million over the next two to three years on pulp washing operations and million to million over the next three years on air emissions 
we believe that our cash flow generated from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our uncommitted line of credit provide sufficient resources to fund operations and to meet our debt payment obligations and foreseeable capital expenditure requirements 
other we continually review any known environmental exposures including the cost of remediation 
at the present time  we are not aware of any environmental liabilities that would have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with federal  state and local laws regarding environmental quality  the environmental protection agency epa has issued a final air and water quality rule referred to as the cluster rule 
we estimate that over the next two to three years required pollution control capital expenditures could range from million to million 
we have included these and other environmental expenditures in our capital expenditure budget discussed above 
although future pollution control expenditures cannot be predicted with any certainty and could continue to escalate because of continuing changes in laws and regulations and uncertainty as to how they will be interpreted and applied  we believe that compliance with these regulations will not have a material impact on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
as part of an industry supported effort  forestry regulations have been developed in oregon and washington to protect salmon 
these regulations restrict the harvest of timber near streams and other environmentally sensitive areas  thereby reducing the timber that can be harvested and increasing costs 
our exposure to market risks on our financial instruments is limited to interest rate changes on variable rate debt  including debt under our revolving credit facilities and interest rate swaps 
the interest rates applied to our variable rate borrowings and swaps are adjusted often and therefore react quickly to any movement in the general trend of market interest rates 
interest expense incurred annually related to our variable rate debt is dependent upon the amount outstanding during the year and the extent to which interest rates rise and fall 
we do not engage in commodity  currency or interest rate hedging arrangements or engage in transactions involving derivatives  other than our entering into the interest rate swaps to obtain a lower effective interest rate on our borrowings 
see note to our financial statements included in item for a more detailed discussion of our interest rate swaps 
if the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt increased by per annum  our annual interest expense would increase by million based on our outstanding debt as of october critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our critical accounting policies are those that may require a higher level of judgment  estimates and complexity 
we believe our most critical accounting policies are those which deal with pension expense and income  impairment of long lived assets  and depletion 
pension assumptions used in the determination of pension income  including the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets  and increases in future compensation are evaluated by us  reviewed with the plan actuaries annually and updated as appropriate 
actual experience that differs from the assumptions could have a significant impact on our financial position and results from operations 
we base our discount rate assumptions on rates of return on long term high quality bonds 
as of october   the company reduced its discount rate to from to reflect decreases in rates of return on high quality bonds  which had occurred from the prior year 
the discount rate of will be used in the determination of net periodic pension income for fiscal year as of october   the company reduced its discount rate to from to reflect decreases in rates of return for high quality bonds  which have occurred since october  net periodic pension income for fiscal year was based on the assumed discount rate 
in addition  the company reduced its discount rate as of october  to from to reflect decreases in rates of return on high quality bonds  which had occurred from the prior year 
the discount rate of was used in the determination of net periodic pension income for fiscal year our assumption regarding the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on historical and projected average rates of return for current asset classes in the plan investment portfolio 
the expected rate of return for fiscal year was and was used in determining net periodic pension income for the year 
the expected rate of return for fiscal year was changed to from to reflect future expected returns for the portfolio and was used in determining net periodic pension income for that year 
the expected rate of return for fiscal year will be changed to from to reflect future expected returns for the portfolio and will be used in determining net periodic pension income for fiscal year at the end of fiscal year  the plan s assets consisted of approximately equities and other assets 
the change to the discount rate effective october   contributed million to the reduction in net periodic pension income for fiscal year the changes in the discount rate and expected rate of return effective october  contributed million to the reduction in net periodic pension income for fiscal year long lived assets an impairment of a long lived asset exists when the carrying value is not recoverable through future operations and when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value 
we review the carrying value of our long lived assets annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations 
to estimate whether the carrying value of an asset group is impaired  we must estimate the undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset and the likelihood of the outcomes 
if the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable through the future cash flows  it is considered impaired 
an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
depletion assumptions and estimates are used to record merchantable timberland inventory and to calculate depletion costs attributed to timber harvested 
merchantable timber is defined as timber with an age of or more years 
the volume of merchantable timber is estimated using industry standard computer software to track growth and is adjusted for acquisitions and dispositions 
volume estimates are confirmed through periodic timber cruises  a physical measurement of timber on a specific set of acres 
costs subject to depletion include the original cost of the timber  as well as capital reforestation expenditures such as site preparation and tree planting related to merchantable age timber  less depletion previously recorded 
depletion rates are determined by dividing the unamortized cost of timber by the estimated volume of timber of merchantable age 
rates of depletion are adjusted every five years for growth and harvest  and are adjusted for any significant acquisition or disposition of timber at the time of such occurrence 
a change in estimated timber inventory volume would have changed depletion expense by  forward looking statements this annual report contains forward looking statements concerning the company

factors that may affect our future operating results you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this report 
they are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock and other securities could decline 
cyclical industry conditions and commodity pricing have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results reflect the general cyclical and seasonal pattern of the forest  paper and packaging products industries 
most of our products are commodity products and are subject to competition from other timber companies and paper and paperboard products manufacturers worldwide 
historically  prices for our products have been volatile  and we  like other participants in the forest  paper and packaging products industries  have limited influence over the timing and extent of price changes for our products 
product pricing is significantly affected by the relationship between supply and demand in the forest  paper and packaging products industries 
product supply is influenced primarily by fluctuations in available manufacturing capacity 
demand is affected by the state of the economy in general and a variety of o ther factors 
the demand for our timber is primarily affected by the level of new residential construction activity and home repair and remodeling activity 
demand for our paper and packaging products is primarily affected by the state of the global economy in general and the economies in north america and east asia in particular 
a prolonged and severe weakness in the markets for one or more of our principal products could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our cash requirements  including the payment of interest and principal on our debt 
our industries are highly competitive and subject to wide price fluctuations that could adversely affect our results of operations 
the forest  paper and packaging products industries are highly competitive globally  and no single company is dominant 
these industries have suffered  and continue to suffer  from excess capacity 
profitability of our manufacturing segment depends in part on our ability to operate our manufacturing facilities efficiently  and our longview mill near full capacity 
during fiscal year  our longview mill operated at of capacity 
these industries are also capital intensive  which leads to high fixed costs and generally results in continued production as long as prices are sufficient to cover marginal costs 
our competitors include large  vertically integrated forest  paper and packaging products companies and numerous smaller co mpanies 
larger companies that compete with us in each of our markets may be better able to withstand the adverse nature of the business cycle because they may have greater financial resources than we do 
in the past  we have seen significant competition in our export markets as our global competitors have benefited from the strength of the us dollar relative to their currencies 
these conditions have contributed to substantial price competition and volatility within our industry  especially during periods of reduced demand 
during fiscal years and  the us dollar weakened 
this had a positive effect on our export business  particularly on european competition in the japanese lumber market where japanese buyers had an advantage purchasing us wood products 
if this trend reverses  future decreases in prices for our products would adversely affect our operating results 
these factors  coupled with our leveraged position  may harm our ability to respond to competition and other market conditions 
price fluctuations in raw materials could adversely affect our ability to cost effectively obtain the materials needed to manufacture our products 
the most significant raw material used in our operations is fiber  including wood  recycled and other fiber  which during fiscal year accounted for of our costs of products produced in our paper and paperboard segment  not including shipping  warehousing and outward freight 
we obtained approximately of our wood fiber requirements at open market prices during fiscal year we also obtained almost all of our recycled fiber on the open market 
wood and recycled fiber are both subject to commodity pricing  which fluctuates on the basis of market factors over which we have no control 
in addition  the cost of fiber that we purchase in the market has at times fluctuated greatly because of economic or industry conditions  particularly the conditions in the pacific northwest  where we purchase most of our fibe r 
further  our access to wood fiber could be adversely affected by consolidation of sawmills in the pacific northwest that supply wood fiber to our longview mill  mill closures due to oversupplied domestic lumber markets  as well as more stringent environmental or other regulations affecting the supply or cost of timber to those sawmills 
we may not be able to pass any future raw material cost increases through to our customers through product price increases 
increased costs of raw materials  and our inability to pass increased costs through to our customers could harm our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
our operations require substantial capital and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements 
our operations require substantial capital 
capital requirements for expansion  replacement and maintenance of existing facilities or equipment or to comply with existing and future changes in environmental laws and regulations may be substantial 
although we maintain our equipment with regular periodic and scheduled maintenance  we cannot be sure that key pieces of equipment will not need to be repaired or replaced or that we will not incur significant additional costs associated with environmental compliance 
the costs of repairing or replacing equipment and the associated downtime of an affected production line could harm our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
if our future capital resources are inadequate to provide for our operating needs  capital expenditures and other cash requirements on eco nomic terms  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow could be harmed 
we are subject to significant environmental regulation and environmental compliance expenditures and liabilities 
our businesses are subject to many federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  particularly with respect to the restoration and reforestation of timberlands  harvesting timber near waterways  discharges of pollutants and emissions  and the management  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances or other contaminants 
compliance with these laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business and we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  significant expenditures to remain in compliance 
for instance  in fiscal we expect to incur approximately million of capital expenditures and approximately million of operating and other non qualified expenditures relating to environmental matters 
we expect that the environmental laws and regulations to which we are sub ject will become more stringent and more stringently enforced in the future 
our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and permit requirements could result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions  including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures  installation of pollution control equipment or remedial actions 
some environmental laws and regulations impose liability and responsibility on present and former owners  operators or users of facilities and sites for contamination at such facilities and sites without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination 
investigations may lead to discoveries of contamination that must be remediated  and closures of facilities may trigger compliance requirements that are not applicable to operating facilities 
consequently  we cannot be sure that existing or future circumstances or developments with respect to contamination  including unanticipated discovery of contamination or discharges of hazardous substances  will not require significant expenditures by us or that internally generated funds or other sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to fund unforeseen environmental l iabilities or expenditures 
some environmental laws permit individuals  citizens groups and other third parties to file claims against us based upon alleged violations of laws or damages to property stemming from contamination  or upon alleged injury to persons stemming from exposure to hazardous substances used or otherwise controlled by us 
we may be required to expend significant sums to defend and or settle existing or future claims 
high energy costs could adversely affect our results of operations 
energy costs are a significant variable operating expense for us and are susceptible to rapid and substantial price increases and volatility 
although our costs for energy declined during fiscal year  they remain at relatively high levels and could rapidly increase 
should energy costs increase in future periods  we may not be able to pass all increased energy costs through to our customers 
in addition  the primary contracts pursuant to which we advantageously purchased and sold power in the past have expired and  under current terms  we have less flexibility in our ability to mitigate the costs of energy used by our facilities 
changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies and offshore manufacturing could result in fluctuations in the price of and the demand for our products 
while all of our sales are made in us dollars  a portion of our sales are made to customers operating in markets that use currencies other than us dollars 
for the fiscal year  exports accounted for approximately of our total sales 
of this amount  of our total sales came from log export sales  all to japan  and of our total sales came from export sales of paper and paperboard  primarily to hong kong  canada and southeast asia 
in fiscal year  the continued weakening of the us dollar relative to the currencies of these countries has helped our products be more competitive in the export market 
however  strengthening in the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies of these countries could make it more expensive for our customers operating in foreign markets to purchase our product s  could make our products less price competitive with our foreign competitors  and could consequently reduce the demand for our products 
in addition  adverse currency valuations could make paper and paperboard from foreign competitors more price competitive in the us market 
this situation has caused  and from time to time in the future may cause  excess supply of paper and paperboard in the united states  which  in turn  would likely result in a decrease in us paper and paperboard prices 
although we believe the migration of domestic manufacturing to offshore locations has slowed in fiscal due to the weakening of the us dollar  we could be adversely affected by the pricing of and demand for our products domestically should further migration occur 
our debt level could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from responding to economic  industry or competitive conditions and funding operational requirements 
we have a large amount of debt 
at our october  fiscal year end  we had million of borrowed debt 
this amount of debt could have important consequences 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest and principal payments on our debt  thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future capital expenditures  working capital and other general corporate requirements  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the forest  paper and packaging products industries  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with competitors that have less debt  and limit our ability to borrow additional funds  even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity 
natural disasters or other events may cause losses to our timber holdings or limit our ability to harvest our timber 
the volume and value of timber that can be harvested from our lands may be limited by natural disasters and other events such as fire  volcanic eruptions  insect infestation  disease  ice storms  wind storms  flooding  other weather conditions and other causes 
the occurrence of any of these events could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  as is typical in the industry  we do not maintain insurance for any loss of our standing timber from natural disasters or other causes 
in addition  fire and other natural disasters in adjacent or nearby timberlands may limit our access to  or impede our ability to  harvest our timber 
in periods of poor logging conditions  we may harvest less timber than expected  thus impacting our net sales of timber during that period 
our business and financial performance may be harmed by future labor disruptions 
over  of our employees  or over of our workforce  are parties to collective bargaining agreements 
as a result  there is a risk of work stoppage due to strikes or walkouts 
we have collective bargaining agreements expiring at various times through calendar year  including two agreements covering approximately employees that will expire during calendar year any significant work stoppage as a result of the failure to successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our pulp and paper mill and all of our paper machines are located at a single complex in longview  washington 
our pulp and paper mill and all of our paper machines are located at a single complex in longview  washington 
since we do not have pulp and paper production elsewhere  a material disruption at our mill could result in a material disruption of our paper making operations 
such disruptions could be caused by prolonged power failures  a breakdown of our continuous pulp digesters or recovery furnaces  chemical spill or release  disruption of raw material supply  disruptions in the transportation infrastructure including railroad tracks  bridges  pipelines  tunnels and roads  or fires  floods  earthquakes  volcanic eruption or other disasters 
although we currently have certain business insurance and replacement value insurance  we cannot assure you that we are adequately insured to cover the total amount of any losses caused by any of the above events 
in addition  we are not insured against any losses due to interruptions in our business due to damage to or destruction of our longview pulp and paper making complex caused by earthquakes or to major transportation infrastructure disruptions or other events that do not occur on our premises 
a disruption in our pulp and paper operations would also adversely affect our converting plants  which in fiscal year obtained approximately of their paper and paperboard requirements from our mill 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we generally do not engage in commodity  currency or interest rate hedging arrangements or engage in transactions involving derivatives  but we have entered into two interest rate swaps to obtain a lower effective interest rate on our borrowings 
see note to our financial statements included in item for a more detailed discussion of our interest rate swaps 
our exposure to market risks on our financial instruments is limited to interest rate changes on variable rate debt  including debt under our revolving credit facilities and our interest rate swap agreements 
the interest rates applied to our variable rate borrowings are adjusted often and therefore react quickly to any movement in the general trend of market interest rates 
interest expense incurred annually related to our variable rate debt is dependent upon the amount outstanding during the year and the extent to which interest rates rise and fall 
if the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt increased by per annum  our annual interest expense would increase by million based on our outstanding debt as of october
