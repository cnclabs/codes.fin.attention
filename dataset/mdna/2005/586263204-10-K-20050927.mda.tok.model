table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview memry provides design  engineering  development and manufacturing services to the medical device and other industries using the company s proprietary shape memory alloy and specialty polymer extrusion technologies 
shape memory alloys are advanced materials which possess the ability to change their shape in response to thermal and mechanical changes  and the ability to return to their original shape following deformations from which conventional materials cannot recover 
specialty polymer extrusion products are complex  multi lumen  multi layer extrusions used for guide wires  catheter shafts  delivery systems and various other interventional medical procedures 
the company provides shape memory alloy products and services from facilities located in bethel  connecticut and menlo park  california and specialty polymer extrusion products and services from the putnam facility in dayville  connecticut 
memry processes raw material usually nitinol  an alloy of nickel and titanium  and plastic polymers into semi finished products such as wire  strip or nitinol and co extruded tube 
products in these forms are referred to as semi finished materials and are marketed directly  primarily to medical device companies  for use in products such as guidewires  endodontic files  stents  delivery systems  catheters and catheter shafts 
the company also further processes its semi finished materials into formed components and sub assemblies 
formed components are made by taking the semi finished material and further processing them by bending  kinking  coating  stamping  crimping  grinding  tipping  laser cutting  etc 
into specific forms specified by customers 
sub assemblies involve taking the semi finished materials or formed components produced by the company and combining or assembling them with other products that have been outsourced by memry to form a larger component or sub assembly required by an oem  usually in the medical device field 
examples are sub assemblies sold for use in endoscopic instruments and finished stent rings utilized in stent graft products 
the company believes that the medical device market for shape memory alloys and specialty polymer extrusion is growing 
early applications were for general surgical instruments and for various vascular procedures 
recently  new opportunities have appeared in orthopedic  urological  electrophysiology  and embolic protection devices 
approximately of the company s products and services are sold to medical device companies  with the balance being utilized in a variety of industrial and commercial applications 
the company sells primarily through a direct sales force  with sales representatives located in the us and europe 
the medical device industry has very strict quality requirements  and the ability to meet these requirements and the requested shipment schedules is a key determinant of success 
price competition has historically been a key competitive variable in products that are not technically difficult to manufacture  such as basic wire for use in applications such as cell phone antennas 
recently  as awareness of potential applications has increased and the industry has grown  the company has noted increased competition for tube products and sub assemblies  with commensurate pressure on prices and margins 
two key areas where management focuses its attention are to reduce the company s dependence on a small number of products procedures and to improve manufacturing efficiency 
through product development and acquisition  the company has expanded the number of products and customers over the past several years and reduced its dependence on a few key products  notably aaa stent graft components 
product and customer diversification continues to be a major strategic initiative for the company 
in addition to providing additional products and services through its core business operations  the company is continuing to explore diversification through acquisitions  such as putnam  joint ventures  and investments 
much of the variability in the company s margins over the past several years can be explained by variations in manufacturing efficiency due to product mix and volume 
in addition  the company has gained efficiencies through a constant process improvement process which has made manufacturing processes more efficient and improved product yields  thereby reducing material losses and improving margins 
recent developments on november   the company completed the putnam acquisition 
the results of putnam s operations have been included in the consolidated results of operations during the period from november   the date of the putnam acquisition  to june  the purchase price  including acquisition costs  consisted of million in cash of which  were accrued payments as of june    shares of memry common stock with a fair value of million and million in deferred payments with a fair value of million 
the shares are subject to various restrictions  including a holding period which prohibits the sale of the shares for a period of eighteen months after november  additionally  after the expiration of the holding period  subject to certain exceptions  the sale of shares in the public market is limited to  per calendar quarter 
the cash portion of the purchase price was financed through a senior credit facility  the issuance of subordinated debt and cash on hand 
refer to the discussion of liquidity and capital resources within this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further details regarding the financing of the putnam acquisition 

table of contents putnam is one of the nation s leading  specialty polymer extrusion companies serving the medical device industry 
its primary products are complex  multi lumen  multi layer extrusions used for guide wires  catheter shafts  delivery systems and various other interventional medical procedures 
looking forward  management of the company believes the putnam acquisition will reinforce the company s market position as a strategic supplier of enabling technologies  products and services to the medical device industry 
the company and putnam supply critical products for many of the same device companies and  occasionally  for the same applications within those companies 
it is expected that the combination of the two companies will lead to greater leverage in penetrating the current market and customer base 
in addition  together  the company and putnam expect to be able to create new applications and customers that could not be developed by either company alone 
accounting policies and critical accounting estimates we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our significant policies are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation  are updated as appropriate  which in most cases is at least quarterly 
we base our estimates on historical experience or various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made  and other materially different estimates could have been reasonably made or material changes in the estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
our critical accounting estimates include the following accounts receivable 
we provide allowances for doubtful accounts on our accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  which may result in the impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
on a regular basis  we review and evaluate the customers financial condition  which generally includes a review of the customers financial statements  trade references and past payment history with us 
we specifically evaluate identified customer risks that may be present and collateral requirements  if any  from the customer  which may include  among other things  deposits  prepayments or letters of credit 
inventories 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we maintain inventory levels based on our projections of future demand and market conditions 
any sudden decline in demand or technological change can cause us to have excess or obsolete inventories 
on an ongoing basis  we review for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their estimated net realizable value based upon our forecasts of future demand and market conditions 
these write downs are reflected in cost of goods sold 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our estimates are primarily influenced by a sudden decline in demand due to economic downturn and technological changes 
goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest an impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value 
goodwill was  and  at june  and june   respectively  an increase of  attributable to the putnam acquisition 
intangible assets consist primarily of management s estimates of developed technology  customer relationships  trade name  and other intangible assets that have been identified as a result of the appraisal process regarding the putnam acquisition 
these assets are being amortized over their useful life  determined to be to years  depending on asset class 
for further details of the acquisition  refer to the discussion of recent developments within this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the acquired patents existing prior to the putnam acquisition are being amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful life of years 
we review intangible assets for impairment annually or as changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value is not recoverable 
intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were  and  as of june  and  respectively 
all of the increase is attributable to the putnam acquisition  offset by amortization expense of  for the year ended june  
table of contents income taxes 
deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the recognition of a valuation allowance for deferred taxes requires management to make estimates about the company s future profitability 
the estimates associated with the valuation of deferred taxes are considered critical due to the amount of deferred taxes recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining the company s future profitability 
deferred tax assets were  and  at june  and  respectively 
contingencies and litigation 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and  as required  have accrued estimates of probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on our litigation exposure

for the past several years  the company has focused on increasing the amount of value added products it provides to the marketplace  ie  products where additional processing is performed on basic nitinol wire  strip  or tube before it is shipped to the customer 
putnam  as part of its extruded polymer business  is also focusing on increasing the amount of value added work it does to its basic polymer catheters 
one market segment of particular interest to the company is the market for repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms aaa using nitinol based stent grafts 
these stent graft repair products are a significant driver of the company s revenue 
however  because the market for stent components is very dynamic and rapidly changing  the company has found it difficult to accurately forecast demand for its stent components 
delays in product launches  uncertain timing on regulatory approvals  inventory adjustments by our customers  market share shifts between competing stent platforms and the introduction of next generation products have all contributed to the variability in revenue generated by shipments of medical stent components 
revenues increased to  during the year ended june  compared to  during fiscal year  an increase of  most of the increase is due to the inclusion of revenues generated by putnam 
putnam s revenues during the period from november  to june  were  another major contributor to the increase in revenues was shipments of nitinol wire based stent components which increased approximately  during the year ended june  compared to fiscal year shipments of nitinol tube based stent components increased approximately  over the same period 
looking foward to fiscal year  the company anticipates that overall nitinol stent component revenue for fiscal year will suffer some decline from the revenues in fiscal year also contributing to the increase in revenues in fiscal were higher shipments of arch wire products which increased approximately  microcoil and guidewire products which increased approximately  and tinel lock  which increased 
table of contents approximately  shipments of components utilized in general surgical applications increased approximately  fiscal over fiscal additionally  revenue from prototype development  and research and development activities increased approximately  excluding putnam s revenue during the period from november  to june  for similar activities of an additional 
the company believes that the increase in revenue from prototype development and research and development activities is an indication that its efforts to fill the pipeline with new product development opportunities is having some success 
offsetting these increases was an approximately  decline in revenue from super elastic tube resulting primarily from what the company believes are inventory adjustments at a major tube customer  price discounts  and customer loss of market share 
shipments of high pressure sealing plugs decreased approximately  in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year costs and expenses 
cost of revenues increased  or to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of two factors 
first  there was a shift in focus of staff engineers at memry s nitinol operations from new process development and prototype support  which is an operating expense  to manufacturing support  which is a manufacturing expense 
in addition  the  of revenues from november  to june  due to the putnam acquisition had a cost of revenues of  as a result of these factors  the company s gross profit declined slightly from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  the company s ability to maintain or grow its gross profit margin is dependent on several factors 
one is the success of the company in securing sufficient business to absorb plant overhead  particularly high margin nitinol tube business 
the company is also in the process of reviewing the manufacturing operations at putnam  including whether additional investment in staff  equipment  and systems may be required to grow putnam s revenues over the next several years 
to the extent such expenditures are required  it may have the effect of reducing profitability  particularly in the short term  at putnam 
operating expenses  including research and development costs  general  selling and administration expenses and amortization of intangible assets increased  or  to  during fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the dollar increase reflects the addition of administrative and sales and marketing personnel and programs associated with the putnam acquisition and amortization of related intangible assets of  in addition  the company increased its investment in sales and marketing through additional spending on advertising  trade shows  and marketing literature 
the company also incurred higher personnel costs  including bonuses of  and increased consultants fees in conjunction with the sarbanes oxley act of section implementation efforts 
offsetting these increases  the shift in focus of staff engineers at the company s nitinol operations from new process development and prototype support  which is an operating expense  to manufacturing support  which is a manufacturing expense  had the effect of reducing operating expenses 
the decrease of operating expenses as a percentage of revenue from in fiscal year to in fiscal year was primarily a net result of the above factors and the increase in revenues in fiscal over fiscal revenue growth from the putnam acquisition and of nitinol based products has enabled and will allow the company to leverage the efforts of its sales and marketing and administrative organizations by broadening the line of products sold through our sales channels and utilizing existing human resource  accounting  and executive staff in supporting the company s requirements 
nonoperating income and expenses 
loss on extinguishment of debt of  in fiscal year was due to the write off of deferred financing costs of  and the penalty on the prepayment of subordinated debt of  the company prepaid this portion of the subordinated debt in order to reduce interest expense in future periods 
net interest expense was  for fiscal compared to net interest income of  in fiscal the change from year to year was due principally to an increase in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with a higher level of borrowing utilized to finance a portion of the putnam acquisition 
income taxes 
the company recorded a provision for income taxes of  for the year ended june   compared to a provision of  for the year ended june  the increase in provision is the result of an increase in the company s pretax income in fiscal and the recording of state research and development r d tax credits of  in fiscal before the r d tax credits in fiscal  the effective income tax rates were in fiscal year and in fiscal year net income 
as a result of the factors discussed above  the company s net income increased by  to  for the fiscal year compared to net income of  for fiscal year

revenues increased in fiscal  to  from  in fiscal  a net increase of  shipments of wire based medical stent components decreased approximately  between fiscal and fiscal the decrease in the wire based medical stent components is a result of inventory adjustments and delays in product launch by a large medical device customer of the company 
tube based medical stent components increased approximately  during the same period 
other medical device component shipments  including products utilized in minimally invasive surgery  decreased approximately  between fiscal and fiscal this decrease related almost entirely to a customer of the company that faced new competition which has led to a decrease in unit shipments to that customer and a reduction in unit prices charged by the company 
microcoil and guidewire products  where the company placed increased marketing and sales emphasis  increased approximately  between fiscal and fiscal a new orthopedic product for bone tamps provided approximately  of revenues in fiscal revenues from sales of high pressure sealing plugs  arch wire and other wire products increased approximately  during fiscal compared to fiscal  and revenues from prototype development and r d activities increased approximately  during fiscal as compared to fiscal revenues from super elastic tube shipments increased  in fiscal versus fiscal  due primarily to increasing usage in neurological applications and for embolic protection procedures 
shipments of martinsitic wire and rod  utilized in various industrial applications  decreased approximately  shipments of tinel lock decreased approximately  in fiscal versus fiscal costs and expenses 
manufacturing costs including costs associated with research and development revenues decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  a decrease of  or 
this decrease is due mainly to productivity improvements in the form of higher yields and the resultant reduction in scrap  primarily in tube manufacturing and processing in the company s west coast facility 
the company s bethel  connecticut manufacturing facility also experienced productivity improvements in fiscal compared to fiscal  reflecting improved manufacturing yields and rapid adjustment of staffing to levels of business 

table of contents due to the reduction in manufacturing costs  the company s gross profit from product sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this improvement was due primarily to efficiencies gained by process improvements in tube and stent production 
the company s ability to maintain these improved levels of gross profit will depend primarily on its success in securing sufficient business to absorb plant overhead  maintaining product pricing in the face of increasing competitive pressure  and maintaining manufacturing yields at acceptable levels 
operating expenses  including general  selling and administration expenses and research and development costs increased  or  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal year general  selling and administration expenses increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal year  an increase of  this increase is primarily due to the bonus of  in fiscal  which is based on a plan approved by the company s compensation committee that accrues bonuses based on a combination of pre tax profit and individual performance 
there was no bonus expense in fiscal another factor that contributed to the increase in general  selling and administration expenses was the increase in investment banking fees which reflects the company s increased efforts in the areas of business development and mergers and acquisitions 
the company has maintained its current levels of expenditures on selling and marketing in order to support future growth in revenues 
the company incurred research and development expenses of  relating to its own internal products as well as the development of future products in fiscal compared to  during fiscal this increase is primarily due to an increase in engineering expense resulting from a shift in focus of staff engineers from manufacturing support to new process development and prototype support 
amortization of intangible assets was  for both periods 
net interest changed to income of  in fiscal from an expense of  in fiscal  due primarily to an increase in interest income associated with a higher average cash balance and a reduction in interest expense associated with a reduced level of borrowings 
income taxes 
the company recorded a provision for income taxes of  for fiscal year versus a tax benefit of  for fiscal this change is due primarily to the elimination of the deferred tax valuation allowance of  in fiscal to recognize deferred tax assets at amounts considered by management more likely than not to be realized and the recording of state r d tax credits of  in fiscal year before the state r d tax credits in fiscal and prior to the elimination of the deferred tax valuation allowance in fiscal  the effective rates were in fiscal and in fiscal net income 
due to the items noted above  the company s net income decreased by  to  in fiscal compared to net income of  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources at june   the company s cash and cash equivalents balance was  a decrease of  from  at the start of fiscal in addition  the company has  of cash collateral deposits relating to cash reserve requirements of the credit and security agreement with webster business credit corporation dated november  the webster agreement that are classified as other assets 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended june   an increase of  from  provided during the fiscal year ended june  this increase was due principally to an increase in cash generated by net income and adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities of  and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  partially offset by increases in inventories of  accounts receivable of  and prepaid expenses and other current assets of  net cash used in investing activities increased  to  during fiscal year compared to  during fiscal year this increase was due to cash used for the putnam acquisition of  cash collateral deposits of  increases in capital expenditures of  and an investment made in biomer of  in the form of a unsecured convertible promissory note
