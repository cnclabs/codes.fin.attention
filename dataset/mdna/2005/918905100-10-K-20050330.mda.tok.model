each of these items is more fully discussed below and or in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company currently believes its income from continuing operations will be lower in as compared to due primarily to the net effects of higher expected chemicals operating income in and the income tax benefits recognized in critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory reserves  impairments of investments in marketable securities and investments accounted for by the equity method  the recoverability of other long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets  pension and other post retirement benefit obligations and the underlying actuarial assumptions related thereto  the realization of deferred income tax assets and accruals for environmental remediation  litigation  income tax and other contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements o the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments and other factors 
the company takes into consideration the current financial condition of its customers  the age of the outstanding balance and the current economic environment when assessing the adequacy of the allowance 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
during  and  the net amount written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of the balance of the allowance for doubtful accounts as of the beginning of the year ranged from to 
o the company provides reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand for its products and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventories reserves may be required 
kronos provides reserves for tools and supplies inventory based generally on both historical and expected future usage requirements 
o the company owns investments in certain companies that are accounted for either as marketable securities carried at fair value or accounted for under the equity method 
for all of such investments  the company records an impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in fair value below its cost basis for marketable securities or below its carrying value for equity method investees that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
at december   the carrying value which equals their fair value of all of the company s marketable securities exceeded the cost basis of each of such investments 
with respect to the company s investment in the amalgamated sugar company llc  which represents approximately of the aggregate carrying value of all of the company s marketable securities at december   the million carrying value of such investment exceeded its million cost basis by about 
at december   the per share quoted market price of the company s investment in timet the only one of the company s equity method investees for which quoted market prices are available was more than three times the company s per share net carrying value of its investment in timet 
o the company recognizes an impairment charge associated with its long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  whenever it determines that recovery of such long lived asset is not probable 
such determination is made in accordance with the applicable gaap requirements associated with the long lived asset  and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
adverse changes in such estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future 
under applicable gaap sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  property and equipment is not assessed for impairment unless certain impairment indicators  as defined  are present 
during  impairment indicators were present only with respect to the property and equipment associated with the company s waste management operating segment  which represented approximately of the company s consolidated net property and equipment as of december  waste control specialists completed an impairment review of its net property and equipment and related net assets as of december  such analysis indicated no impairment was present as the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with such operations exceeded the carrying value of such operation s net assets 
significant judgment is required in estimating such undiscounted cash flows 
such estimated cash flows are inherently uncertain  and there can be no assurance that the future cash flows reflected in these projections will be achieved 
under applicable gaap sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is required to be reviewed for impairment at least on an annual basis 
goodwill will also be reviewed for impairment at other times during each year when impairment indicators  as defined  are present 
as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  the company has assigned its goodwill to four reporting units as that term is defined in sfas no 

goodwill attributable to the chemicals operating segment was assigned to the reporting unit consisting of kronos in total 
goodwill attributable to the component products operating segment was assigned to three reporting units within that operating segment  one consisting of compx s security products operations  one consisting of compx s european operations and one consisting of compx s canadian and taiwanese operations 
no goodwill impairments were deemed to exist as a result of the company s annual impairment review completed during the third quarter of  as the estimated fair value of each such reporting unit exceeded the net carrying value of the respective reporting unit kronos reporting unit  compx security products reporting unit  compx european operations reporting unit and compx canadian and taiwanese operations reporting unit 
the estimated fair values of the three compx reporting units are determined based on discounted cash flow projections  and the estimated fair value of the kronos reporting unit is based upon the quoted market price for kronos common stock  as appropriately adjusted for a control premium 
significant judgment is required in estimating the discounted cash flows for the compx reporting units 
such estimated cash flows are inherently uncertain  and there can be no assurance that compx will achieve the future cash flows reflected in its projections 
the company did  however  recognize a million impairment with respect to compx s european operations in the fourth quarter of  following compx s decision to dispose of those assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
o the company maintains various defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb 
the amounts recognized as defined benefit pension and opeb expenses  and the reported amounts of prepaid and accrued pension costs and accrued opeb costs  are actuarially determined based on several assumptions  including discount rates  expected rates of returns on plan assets and expected health care trend rates 
variances from these actuarially assumed rates will result in increases or decreases  as applicable  in the recognized pension and opeb obligations  pension and opeb expenses and funding requirements 
these assumptions are more fully described below under assumptions on defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans 
o the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realized under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  it is possible that in the future the company may change its estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized in the future  resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period such change in estimate was made 
for example  kronos has substantial net operating loss carryforwards in germany the equivalent of million for german corporate purposes and million for german trade tax purposes at december  
during the company concluded that the more likely than not recognition criteria had been met with respect to the income tax benefit associated with kronos german net operating loss carryforwards in germany 
prior to the complete utilization of such carryforwards  it is possible that the company might conclude in the future that the benefit of such carryforwards would no longer meet the more likely than not recognition criteria  at which point the company would be required to recognize a valuation allowance against the then remaining tax benefit associated with the carryforwards 
o the company records accruals for environmental  legal  income tax and other contingencies and commitments when estimated future expenditures associated with such contingencies become probable  and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
however  new information may become available  or circumstances such as applicable laws and regulations may change  thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount required to be accrued for such matters and therefore a decrease or increase in reported net income in the period of such change 
operating income for each of the company s three operating segments are impacted by certain of these significant judgments and estimates  as summarized below o chemicals allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventories  impairment of equity method investees  goodwill and other long lived assets  defined benefit pension and opeb plans and loss accruals 
o component products allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventories  impairment of long lived assets and loss accruals 
o waste management allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets and loss accruals 
in addition  general corporate and other items are impacted by the significant judgments and estimates for impairment of marketable securities and equity method investees  defined benefit pension and opeb plans  deferred income tax asset valuation allowances and loss accruals 
chemicals kronos relative changes in kronos tio sales and operating income during the past three years are primarily due to i relative changes in tio sales and production volumes  ii relative changes in tio average selling prices and iii relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
selling prices in billing currencies for tio  kronos principal product  were generally decreasing during the first quarter of  flat during the second quarter of  increasing during the last half of and the first quarter of  flat during the second quarter of  decreasing during the last half of and the first quarter of  flat during the second quarter of and increasing in the last half of years ended december  change in millions  except selling price data net sales   operating income operating income margin tio operating statistics sales volumes production volumes production rate as percent of capacity full full average selling prices index percent change in ti average selling prices using actual foreign currency exchange rates impact of changes in foreign exchange rates in billing currencies thousands of metric tons kronos sales increased million in as compared to as the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  which increased chemicals sales by approximately million as further discussed below  and higher sales volumes more than offset the impact of lower average tio selling prices 
excluding the effect of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies were lower in as compared to when translated from billing currencies into us dollars using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods  kronos average tio selling prices in increased in as compared to kronos sales increased million in compared to due primarily to higher average tio selling prices  higher sales volumes and the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  which increased sales by approximately million as further discussed below 
excluding the effect of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies in were higher than  with the greatest improvement in european and export markets 
when translated from billing currencies to us dollars using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods  kronos average tio selling prices in increased compared to kronos sales are denominated in various currencies  including the us dollar  the euro  other major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
the disclosure of the percentage change in kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies which excludes the effects of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies is considered a non gaap financial measure under regulations of the sec 
the disclosure of the percentage change in kronos average tio selling prices using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods is considered the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with gaap gaap measure 
kronos discloses percentage changes in its average tio prices in billing currencies because kronos believes such disclosure provides useful information to investors to allow them to analyze such changes without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of the relative changes in average selling prices in the actual various billing currencies 
generally  when the us dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies  the percentage change in average selling prices in billing currencies will be higher or lower  respectively  than such percentage changes would be using actual exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods 
the difference between the and increases in kronos average tio selling prices during and  respectively  as compared to the respective prior year using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods the gaap measure  and the increase and decrease in kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies the non gaap measure during such periods is due to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the above table presents in a tabular format i the percentage change in kronos average tio selling prices using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods the gaap measure  ii the percentage change in kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies the non gaap measure and iii the percentage change due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the reconciling item between the non gaap measure and the gaap measure 
chemicals operating income in includes million of income related to the settlement of a contract dispute with a customer 
as part of the settlement  the customer agreed to make payments to kronos through aggregating million 
the million gain recognized represents the present value of the future payments to be paid by the customer to kronos 
the dispute with the customer concerned the customer s alleged past failure to purchase the required amount of tio from kronos under the terms of kronos contract with the customer 
under the settlement  the customer agreed to pay an aggregate of million to kronos through to resolve such dispute 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
kronos operating income decreased million in as compared to  as the effect of lower average tio selling prices and higher raw material and maintenance costs more than offset the impact of higher sales and production volumes and the income from the contract dispute settlement 
kronos operating income increased million in compared to due primarily to higher average tio selling prices and higher tio sales and production volumes 
kronos tio sales volumes in increased compared to  as higher volumes in european and export markets more than offset lower volumes in canada 
approximately one half of kronos tio sales volumes were attributable to markets in europe  with attributable to north america and the balance to export markets 
demand for tio has remained strong throughout  and while kronos believes that the strong demand is largely attributable to the end use demand of its customers  it is possible that some portion of the strong demand resulted from customers increasing their inventory levels of tio in advance of implementation of announced or anticipated price increases 
kronos operating income comparisons were also favorably impacted by higher production levels  which increased 
kronos operating rates were near full capacity in both periods  and kronos sales and production volumes in were both new records for kronos  setting new volume records for kronos for the third consecutive year 
kronos tio sales volumes in increased from  with higher volumes in european and north american markets more than offsetting lower volumes in export markets 
kronos tio production volumes in were higher than  with operating rates near full capacity in both years 
kronos has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states primarily in germany  belgium  norway and canada 
a significant amount of kronos sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro  other major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
a portion of kronos sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in the non us dollar 
certain raw materials  primarily titanium containing feedstocks  are purchased in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of kronos foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or adversely impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
overall  fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  primarily the euro  increased tio sales by a net million in as compared to  and increased sales by a net million in as compared to fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies similarly impacted kronos foreign currency denominated operating expenses 
kronos operating costs that are not denominated in the us dollar  when translated into us dollars  were higher in and compared to the same periods of the respective prior years 
overall  currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a net million increase in kronos operating income in as compared to  and resulted in a net million decrease in kronos operating income in as compared to reflecting the impact of partial implementation of prior price increase announcements  kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies in the fourth quarter of were higher than the third quarter of kronos expects its average selling prices will be higher in as compared to  reflecting the expected continued implementation of price increase announcements  including kronos latest price increases announced in march the extent to which all of such price increases  and any additional price increases which may be announced subsequently in  will be realized will depend on  among other things  economic factors 
kronos efforts to debottleneck its production facilities to meet long term demand continue to prove successful 
kronos production capacity has increased by approximately over the past ten years due to debottlenecking programs  with only moderate capital investment 
kronos believes its annual attainable production capacity for is approximately  metric tons  with some slight additional capacity available in through kronos continued debottlenecking efforts 
kronos expects its tio production volumes in will be slightly higher than its volumes  with sales volumes comparable to slightly lower in as compared to kronos average tio selling prices  which started to increase during the second half of  are expected to continue to increase during  and consequently kronos currently expects its average tio selling prices  in billing currencies  will be higher in as compared to overall  kronos expects it chemicals operating income in will be higher than  due primarily to higher expected selling prices 
kronos expectations as to the future prospects of kronos and the tio industry are based upon a number of factors beyond kronos control  including worldwide growth of gross domestic product  competition in the marketplace  unexpected or earlier than expected capacity additions and technological advances 
if actual developments differ from kronos expectations  kronos results of operations could be unfavorably affected 
chemicals operating income  as presented above  is stated net of amortization of valhi s purchase accounting adjustments made in conjunction with its acquisitions of its interest in nl and kronos 
such adjustments result in additional depreciation and amortization expense beyond amounts separately reported by kronos 
such additional non cash expenses reduced chemicals operating income  as reported by valhi  by million in  million in and million in as compared to amounts separately reported by kronos 
changes in the aggregate amount of purchase accounting adjustment amortization during the past three years is due primarily to the effect of relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
component products compx years ended december  change in millions net sales operating income operating income margin component products sales were higher in as compared to due in part to the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  as discussed below  increased component products sales by million in as compared to component products sales comparisons were also impacted by increases in product prices for precision slides and ergonomic products  which were primarily a pass through of raw material steel cost increases to customers 
during  sales of slide products increased as compared to  while sales of security products decreased less than and sales of ergonomic products increased during the same period 
the percentage changes in both slide and ergonomic products include the impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
sales of security products are generally denominated in us dollars 
component products operating income comparisons in were favorably impacted by the effect of certain cost reduction initiatives undertaken in component products operating income comparisons were also impacted by the net effects of increases in the cost of steel the primary raw material for compx s products and continued reductions in manufacturing  fixed overhead and other overhead costs 
component products sales were higher in as compared to due primarily to the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  as discussed below  increased net sales by million in as compared to in addition to the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  component products sales increased in as compared to due to the net effects of higher sales volumes of security products and precision slide products in north american markets partially offset by lower sales volumes of ergonomic products 
during  sales of slide and security products increased and  respectively  as compared to  while sales of ergonomic products decreased 
the percentage changes in both slide and ergonomic products include the impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
component products operating income increased in as compared to due in part to the favorable effect of cost improvement initiatives  such as consolidating compx s two canadian facilities into one facility 
component products operating income comparisons were negatively affected by the expenses associated with such facility consolidation approximately  and increases in the cost for steel 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  as discussed below  decreased operating income by million in as compared to in addition  component products operating income in includes charges aggregating million related to the re tooling of one of compx s manufacturing facilities and provisions for changes in estimate with respect to obsolete and slow moving inventories  overhead absorption rates and other items 
compx has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states in canada and taiwan 
a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the non us dollar  principally the canadian dollar and the new taiwan dollar 
in addition  a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations principally in canada are denominated in the us dollar 
most raw materials  labor and other production costs for such non us operations are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar values of compx s foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
during  currency exchange rate fluctuations positively impacted component products sales comparisons with  while currency exchange rate fluctuations did not significantly impact component products operating income comparisons for the same periods 
during  currency exchange rate fluctuations of the canadian dollar positively impacted component products sales comparisons with principally with respect to slide products  but currency exchange rate fluctuations of the canadian dollar negatively impacted component products operating income comparisons for the same periods 
while demand has stabilized in across most of compx s product segments  certain customers are seeking lower cost asian sources as alternatives to compx s products 
compx believes the impact of this will be mitigated through its ongoing initiatives to expand both new products and new market opportunities 
asian sourced competitive pricing pressures are expected to continue to be a challenge as asian manufacturers  particularly those located in china  gain market share 
compx has responded to the competitive pricing pressure in part by reducing production cost through product reengineering  improvement in manufacturing processes or moving production to lower cost facilities including compx s own asian based manufacturing facilities 
compx has also emphasized and focused on opportunities where it can provide value added customer support services that asian based manufacturers are generally unable to provide 
compx believes its combination of cost control initiatives together with its value added approach to development and marketing of products helps to mitigate the impact of competitive pricing pressures 
additionally  compx s cost for steel continues to rise dramatically due to the continued high demand and shortages worldwide 
while compx has thus far been able to pass a majority of its higher raw material costs on to its customers through price increases and surcharges  there is no assurance that it would be able to continue to pass along any additional higher costs to its customers 
the price increases and surcharges may accelerate the efforts of some of compx s customers to find less expensive products from foreign manufacturers 
compx will continue to focus on cost improvement initiatives  utilizing lean manufacturing techniques and prudent balance sheet management in order to minimize the impact of lower sales  particularly to the office furniture industry  and to develop value added customer relationships with an additional focus on sales of compx s higher margin ergonomic computer support systems to improve operating results 
these actins  along with other activities to eliminate excess capacity  are designed to position compx to expand more effectively on both new product and new market opportunities to improve compx s profitability 
waste management waste control specialists years ended december  in millions net sales operating loss waste management sales increased  and its operating loss declined  in as compared to due to higher utilization of waste management services  offset in part by higher expenses associated with the additional staffing and consulting requirements related to licensing efforts to expand low level and mixed radioactive waste storage and disposal capabilities 
waste control specialists also continues to explore opportunities to obtain certain types of new business including treatment and storage of certain types of waste that  if obtained  could help to further increase its sales  and decrease its operating loss  in waste management sales decreased  and its operating loss increased  in compared to due to continued weak demand for waste management services as well as costs incurred in related to certain licensing and permitting activities 
waste control specialists continued emphasis on cost control helped to mitigate the effect of lower sales 
waste control specialists currently has permits which allow it to treat  store and dispose of a broad range of hazardous and toxic wastes  and to treat and store a broad range of low level and mixed low level radioactive wastes 
although sales improved in the third quarter  the waste management industry is still experiencing a relative decline in the number of environmental remediation projects generating wastes 
in addition  efforts on the part of generators to reduce the volume of waste and or manage waste onsite at their facilities also have resulted in weak demand for waste control specialists waste management services 
these factors have led to reduced demand and increased downward price pressure for waste management services 
while waste control specialists believes its broad range of authorizations for the treatment and storage of low level and mixed low level radioactive waste streams provides certain competitive advantages  a key element of waste control specialists long term strategy to provide one stop shopping for hazardous  low level and mixed low level radioactive wastes includes obtaining additional regulatory authorizations for the disposal of low level and mixed low level radioactive wastes 
prior to june  the state law in texas where waste control specialists disposal facility is located prohibited the applicable texas regulatory agency from issuing a license for the disposal of a broad range of low level and mixed low level radioactive waste to a private enterprise operating a disposal facility in texas 
in june  a new texas state law was enacted that allows tceq to issue a low level radioactive waste disposal license to a private entity  such as waste control specialists 
waste control specialists has applied for such a disposal license with tceq  and waste control specialists was the only entity to submit an application for such a disposal license 
the length of time that it will take to review and act upon the license application is uncertain  although waste control specialists does not currently expect the agency would issue any final decision on the license application before there can be no assurance that waste control specialists will be successful in obtaining any such license 
waste control specialists applied to tdshs for a license to dispose of by product e waste material in june waste control specialists can currently treat and store byproduct material  but may not dispose of it 
the length of time that tdshs will take to review and act upon the license application is uncertain  but waste control specialists expects the tdshs will issue a final decision on the license application by the end of there can be no assurance that waste control specialists will be successful in obtaining any such license 
waste control specialists is continuing its efforts to increase its sales volumes from waste streams that conform to authorizations it currently has in place 
waste control specialists is also continuing to identify certain waste streams  and attempting to obtain modifications to its current permits  that would allow for treatment  storage and disposal of additional types of wastes 
the ability of waste control specialists to achieve increased sales volumes of these waste streams  together with improved operating efficiencies through further cost reductions and increased capacity utilization  are important factors in waste control specialists ability to achieve improved cash flows 
the company currently believes waste control specialists can become a viable  profitable operation  even if waste control specialists is unsuccessful in obtaining a license for the disposal of a broad range of low level and mixed low level radioactive wastes 
however  there can be no assurance that waste control specialists efforts will prove successful in improving its cash flows 
valhi has in the past  and may in the future  consider strategic alternatives with respect to waste control specialists 
there can be no assurance that the company would not report a loss with respect to any such strategic transaction

dividends on preferred stock income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle attributable to common stock equity in earnings losses of timet the company accounts for its interest in timet by the equity method 
the company s equity in earnings of timet differs from the amounts that would be expected by applying tremont s ownership percentage to timet s separately reported earnings because of the effect of amortization of purchase accounting adjustments made by the company in conjunction with the company s acquisitions of its interests in timet 
amortization of such basis differences generally increases earnings or reduces losses attributable to timet as reported by the company  and aggregated million in exclusive of the provision for an other than temporary impairment of the company s investment in timet discussed below  million in and million in in february  timet completed a reverse stock split of its common stock at a ratio of one share of post split common stock for each outstanding ten shares of pre split common stock  and in august timet subsequently completed a split of its common stock 
the per share disclosures related to timet discussed herein have been adjusted to give effect to such splits 
implementing such splits had no financial statement impact to the company  and the company s ownership interest in timet did not change as a result thereof 
the company periodically evaluates the net carrying value of its long term assets  including its investment in timet  to determine if there has been any decline in value below its amortized cost basis that is other than temporary and would  therefore  require a write down which would be accounted for as a realized loss 
at september   after considering what it believed to be all relevant factors  including  among other things  timet s then recent nyse stock prices  and timet s operating results  financial position  estimated asset values and prospects  the company recorded a million impairment provision for an other than temporary decline in value of its investment in timet 
such impairment provision is reported as part of the company s equity in losses of timet in in determining the amount of the impairment charge  tremont considered  among other things  then recent ranges of timet s nyse market price and current estimates of timet s future operating losses that would further reduce tremont s carrying value of its investment in timet as it records additional equity in losses of timet 
while gaap may require an investment in a security accounted for by the equity method to be written down if the market value of that security declines  they do not permit a writeup if the market value subsequently recovers 
at december   the company s net carrying value of its investment in timet was per share compared to a nyse market price at that date of per share 
timet reported higher sales in as compared to  and operating income improved from million to million  in part due to the net effects of a increase in sales volumes of mill products  a increase in sales volumes of melted products ingot and slab and an increase in melted product average selling prices 
timet s mill product average selling prices were positively affected by the weakening of the us dollar compared to the british pound sterling and the euro  and were negatively impacted by changes in customer and product mix 
the increase in sales volumes for mill and melted products is principally the result of greater market demands and share gains 
as discussed above  a substantial portion of timet s business is derived from the commercial aerospace industry  and sales of titanium to that market sector generally precede aircraft deliveries by about one year 
therefore  timet s sales benefited significantly from the increase in production of large commercial aircraft scheduled for delivery in timet s operating results in includes income in the first quarter of million related to a change in timet s vacation policy 
timet s operating results comparisons were also favorably impacted by improved plant operating rates  which increased from in to in  and timet s continued cost management efforts 
timet s operating results comparisons were negatively impacted by relative changes in timet s lifo inventory reserves  which reduced timet s operating income in by million as compared with  as well as higher costs for raw materials scrap and alloys and energy 
timet s operating results in include i a million charge related to the termination of timet s purchase and sale agreement with wyman gordon and ii a million reduction in its accrual for a previously reported product liability matter 
timet s operating results in were also negatively affected by higher accruals for employee incentive compensation 
in august  timet completed an exchange offer in which approximately million shares of the outstanding convertible preferred debt securities issued by timet capital trust i a wholly owned subsidiary of timet were exchanged for an aggregate of million shares of a newly created series a preferred stock of timet at the exchange rate of one share of series a preferred stock for each convertible preferred debt security 
timet recognized a non cash pre tax gain of million related to such exchange 
the exchange of the convertible preferred debt securities for a new issue of timet preferred stock will result in timet reporting lower interest expense going forward  although the effect on timet s income attributable to common stock of lower interest expense will be substantially offset by dividends accruing on the new preferred stock 
timet reported higher sales in as compared to  and timet improved from a million operating loss in to operating income of million in timet s net sales increased in due in part to a increase in sales volumes of melted products  changes in product mix and a weakening of the us dollar as compared to the british pound sterling and the euro 
these factors were partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices for melted products 
the improvement in melted product sales volumes  and the decrease in melted products selling prices  are due principally to new customer relationships and a change in product mix 
timet s results in also include a i million charge related to the termination of timet s purchase and sales agreement with wyman gordon company and ii a million reduction in its accrual for a product liability matter 
timet reported a reduction in its lifo inventory reserve at the end of as compared to the end of  favorably impacting timet s operating results in by million 
this compared with an increase in timet s lifo reserve during  which negatively impacted timet s operating results in by million 
timet s operating results in were also favorably impacted by the effects of timet s continued cost reduction efforts and raw material mix 
under timet s previously reported amended long term agreement with boeing  boeing advanced timet million for each of   and  and boeing is required to continue to advance timet million annually during and the agreement is structured as a take or pay agreement such that boeing  beginning in calendar year  will forfeit a proportionate part of the million annual advance  or effectively per pound  to the extent that its orders for delivery for such calendar year are less than million pounds 
timet can only be required  however  to deliver up to million pounds per quarter 
based on timet s actual deliveries to boeing of approximately million pounds during  million pounds during and million pounds during  timet recognized income of million in  million in and million in related to the take or pay provisions of the contract 
these earnings related to the take or pay provisions distort timet s operating income percentages as there is no corresponding amount reported in timet s sales 
timet s results in also include a million provision for an other than temporary impairments of timet s investment in the convertible preferred securities of special metals corporation smc 
the company s equity in losses of timet in includes i an impairment provision of million million  or 
per diluted share  net of income tax benefit and minority interest related to an other than temporary decline in value of the company s investment in timet and ii a million charge million  or 
per diluted share  net of income tax benefit and minority interest related to the company s pro rata share of timet s impairment provision for an other than temporary decline in value of the smc securities 
timet s effective income tax rate in  and varies from the us federal statutory income tax rate primarily because timet has concluded it is not currently appropriate to recognize an income tax benefit related to its us and us losses under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
in addition  timet s provision for income taxes in includes a million income tax benefit million  or 
per diluted share  net of income taxes related to the utilization of a capital loss carryforward  the benefit of which had not been previously recognized by timet 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning certain workers compensation bonds issued on behalf of a former subsidiary of timet 
over the past several quarters  timet has seen the availability of raw materials tighten  and  consequently  the prices for such raw materials increase 
timet currently expects that a shortage in raw materials is likely to continue throughout and into  which could limit timet s ability to produce enough titanium products to fully meet customer demand 
in addition  timet has certain customer long term agreements that limit timet s ability to pass on all of its increased raw material costs 
timet currently expects its net sales revenue will range from million to million 
timet s mill product sales volumes  which were  metric tons in  are expected to range from  and  metric tons in  while melted product sales volumes  which were  metric tons in  are expected to range from  and  metric tons in timet also expects mill product average selling prices will increase by to in as compared to  and melted product average selling prices are expected to increase from to in as compared to timet s cost of sales is affected by a number of factors including customer and product mix  material yields  plant operating rates  raw material costs  labor and energy costs 
raw material costs  which include sponge  scrap and alloys  represent the largest portion of timet s manufacturing cost structure  and  as previously discussed  continued cost increases are expected during scrap and certain alloy prices have more than doubled from year ago prices  and increased energy costs also continue to have a negative impact on gross margin 
in addition  timet s cost of sales can be significantly affected by adjustments to its lifo inventory reserve  as was the case during and timet currently expects its production volumes will continue to increase in  with overall capacity utilization expected to approximate to in as compared to in 
however  practical capacity utilization measures can vary significantly based on product mix 
timet anticipates that boeing will purchase a significantly higher amount of metal during as compared to and  therefore  expects the amount of take or pay income recognized during to decrease to between million and million 
overall  timet presently expects its operating income for will be between million to million 
dividends on timet s series a preferred stock should approximate million in  with timet currently expecting net income attributable to common stockholders to range from million to million 
timet s net income estimates include a net million non operating gain currently expected to be recognized in the second quarter of related to the sale of certain real property adjacent to timet s nevada facility  which closed in the fourth quarter of timet s net income estimates exclude an income tax benefit of million to million that timet might recognize during if timet determines that reversal of a portion of timet s deferred tax asset valuation allowance with respect to its us and us net operating loss carryforwards is determined to be appropriate under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
general corporate and other items general corporate interest and dividend income 
general corporate interest and dividend income in was comparable to  while general corporate interest and dividend income decreased million in as compared to due to a lower average level of invested funds and lower average yields 
a significant portion of the company s general corporate interest and dividend income relates to distributions received from the amalgamated sugar company llc and interest income on the company s million loan to snake river sugar company

net legal settlement gains of million in   in and  in relate to nl s settlements with certain of its former insurance carriers 
these settlements  as well as similar prior settlements nl reached in and  resolved court proceedings in which nl had sought reimbursement from the carriers for legal defense costs and indemnity coverage for certain of its environmental remediation expenditures 
no further material settlements relating to litigation concerning environmental remediation coverages are expected

general corporate expenses 
net general corporate expenses in were million lower than due primarily to lower environmental remediation and legal expenses of nl 
net general corporate expenses in were million higher than due primarily to higher environmental remediation expenses of nl principally related to one formerly owned site of nl for which the remediation process is expected to occur over the next several years 
environmental expenses are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
in addition  nl s million of proceeds from the disposal of its specialty chemicals business unit in january related to its agreement not to compete in the rheological products business was recognized as a component of general corporate income expense ratably over the five year non compete period ended in january million recognized in and  recognized in 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net general corporate expenses in calendar are currently expected to be higher as compared to  primarily due to higher expected litigation and related expenses of nl 
however  obligations for environmental remediation obligations are difficult to assess and estimate  and no assurance can be given that actual costs will not exceed accrued amounts or that costs will not be incurred in the future with respect to sites for which no estimate of liability can presently be made 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense 
the company has a significant amount of indebtedness denominated in the euro  including kii s euro denominated senior secured notes 
accordingly  the reported amount of interest expense will vary depending on relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest expense in was higher than due primarily to relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which increased the us dollar equivalent of interest expense on the euro million principal amount of kii senior secured notes outstanding during both years by approximately million as compared to the respective prior year 
in addition  kii issued an additional euro million principal amount of kii senior secured notes in november  and the interest expense associated with these additional senior secured notes was million in interest expense declined million in as compared to due primarily to the net effects of lower average levels of indebtedness of valhi parent  higher average levels of indebtedness of kronos and lower average interest rates on kronos indebtedness 
assuming interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates do not increase significantly from current levels  interest expense in is expected to be higher than due primarily to the effect of the issuance of an additional euro million principal amount of kii senior secured notes in november at december   approximately million of consolidated indebtedness  principally kii s senior secured notes and valhi s loans from snake river sugar company  bears interest at fixed interest rates averaging million with a weighted average interest rate of  million with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 
the weighted average interest rate on million of outstanding variable rate borrowings at december  was  
relative changes in the weighted average interest rate on outstanding variable rate borrowings at december   and are due primarily to relative differences in the mix of such borrowings  with higher relative outstanding borrowings at december  and as compared to december  under the kii european revolver  for which the interest rate is generally higher than the interest rate on any outstanding us variable borrowings 
as noted above  kii has a significant amount of indebtedness denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
provision for income taxes 
the principal reasons for the difference between the company s effective income tax rates and the us federal statutory income tax rates are explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   kronos had the equivalent of million and million of income tax loss carryforwards for german corporate and trade tax purposes  respectively  all of which have no expiration date 
as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  kronos had previously provided a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance against substantially all of these tax loss carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences in germany because kronos did not believe they met the more likely than not recognition criteria 
during the first six months of  kronos reduced its deferred income tax asset valuation allowance by approximately million  primarily as a result of utilization of these german net operating loss carryforwards  the benefit of which had not previously been recognized 
at june   after considering all available evidence  kronos concluded that these german tax loss carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences now met the more likely than not recognition criteria 
under applicable gaap related to accounting for income taxes at interim periods  a change in estimate at an interim period resulting in a decrease in the valuation allowance is segregated into two components  the portion related to the remaining interim periods of the current year and the portion related to all future years 
the portion of the valuation allowance reversal related to the former is recognized over the remaining interim periods of the current year  and the portion of the valuation allowance related to the latter is recognized at the time the change in estimate is made 
accordingly  as of june   kronos reversed million of the valuation allowance the portion related to future years  and kronos reversed the remaining million during the last six months of because the benefit of such net operating loss carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences in germany has now been recognized  the company s effective income tax rate in is expected to be higher than what it would have otherwise been  although its future cash income tax rate will not be affected by the reversal of the valuation allowance 
prior to the complete utilization of such carryforwards  it is possible that the company might conclude in the future that the benefit of such carryforwards would no longer meet the more likely than not recognition criteria  at which point the company would be required to recognize a valuation allowance against the then remaining tax benefit associated with the carryforwards 
also during  nl recognized a second quarter million income tax benefit related to income tax attributes of nl environmental management services  inc ems  a subsidiary of nl 
this income tax benefit resulted from a settlement agreement reached with the us irs concerning the irs previously reported examination of a certain restructuring transaction involving ems  and included i a million tax benefit related to a reduction in the amount of additional income taxes and interest which nl estimates it will be required to pay related to this matter as a result of the settlement agreement and ii a million tax benefit related to the reversal of a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to certain tax attributes of ems including a us net operating loss carryforward which nl now believes meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
in january  the german federal government enacted new tax law amendments that limit the annual utilization of income tax loss carryforwards effective january  to of taxable income after the first euro million of taxable income 
the new law will have a significant effect on kronos cash tax payments in germany going forward  the extent of which will be dependent upon the level of taxable income earned in germany 
during  nl and kronos reduced their deferred income tax asset valuation allowance by an aggregate of approximately million  primarily as a result of utilization of certain income tax attributes for which the benefit had not previously been recognized 
in addition  kronos recognized a million income tax benefit related to the net refund of certain prior year german income taxes 
during  nl and kronos reduced their deferred income tax asset valuation allowance by an aggregate of approximately million  primarily as a result of utilization of certain income tax attributes for which the benefit had not previously been recognized 
during  tremont increased its deferred income tax asset valuation allowance at the valhi consolidated level by a net million primarily because tremont concluded certain tax attributes do not currently meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
the provision for income taxes in also includes a million deferred income tax benefit related to certain changes in the belgian tax law 
in october  the american jobs creation act of was enacted into law 
the new law contains several provisions that could impact the company 
these provisions provide for  among other things  a special deduction from us taxable income equal to a stipulated percentage of qualified income from domestic production activities as defined beginning in  and a special dividends received deduction for certain dividends received from controlled foreign corporations 
both of these provisions are complex and subject to numerous limitations

minority interest 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
minority interest in nl s subsidiary relates to nl s majority owned environmental management subsidiary  nl environmental management services  inc ems 
ems was established in  at which time ems contractually assumed certain of nl s environmental liabilities 
ems earnings are based  in part  upon its ability to favorably resolve these liabilities on an aggregate basis 
the shareholders of ems  other than nl  actively manage the environmental liabilities and share in of ems cumulative earnings 
nl continues to consolidate ems and provides accruals for the reasonably estimable costs for the settlement of ems environmental liabilities  as discussed below 
as previously reported  waste control specialists was formed by valhi and another entity in waste control specialists assumed certain liabilities of the other owner and such liabilities exceeded the carrying value of the assets contributed by the other owner 
since its inception in  waste control specialists has reported aggregate net losses 
consequently  all of waste control specialists aggregate  inception to date net losses have accrued to the company for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  no minority interest in waste control specialists has been recognized in the company s consolidated financial statements 
waste control specialists llc became wholly owned by valhi during the second quarter of following completion of the merger transactions in which tremont became wholly owned by valhi in february  the company no longer reports minority interest in tremont s net assets or earnings 
the company commenced recognizing minority interest in kronos net assets and earnings in december following nl s distribution of a portion of the shares of kronos common stock to its shareholders

assumptions on defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans 
defined benefit pension plans 
the company maintains various defined benefit pension plans in the us  europe and canada 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the projected benefit obligations for all defined benefit plans was comprised of million related to us plans and million related to us plans 
all of such projected benefit obligations attributable to non us plans related to plans maintained by kronos  and approximately  and of the projected benefit obligations attributable to us plans related to plans maintained by nl  kronos and medite corporation  a former business unit of valhi medite plan 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans using sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
under sfas no 
 defined benefit pension plan expense and prepaid and accrued pension costs are each recognized based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed increase in future compensation levels 
the company recognized consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense of million in  million in and million in the amount of funding requirements for these defined benefit pension plans is generally based upon applicable regulation such as erisa in the us  and will generally differ from pension expense recognized under sfas no 
for financial reporting purposes 
contributions to all defined benefit pension plans aggregated million in  million in and million in the discount rates the company utilizes for determining defined benefit pension expense and the related pension obligations are based on current interest rates earned on long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by recognized rating agencies in the applicable country where the defined benefit pension benefits are being paid 
in addition  the company receives advice about appropriate discount rates from the company s third party actuaries  who may in some cases utilize their own market indices 
the discount rates are adjusted as of each valuation date september th for the kronos and nl plans and december st for the medite plan to reflect then current interest rates on such long term bonds 
such discount rates are used to determine the actuarial present value of the pension obligations as of december st of that year  and such discount rates are also used to determine the interest component of defined benefit pension expense for the following year 
approximately   and of the projected benefit obligations attributable to plans maintained by kronos at december  related to kronos plans in germany  norway  canada and the us  respectively 
the medite plan and nl s plans are all in the us the company uses several different discount rate assumptions in determining its consolidated defined benefit pension plan obligations and expense because the company maintains defined benefit pension plans in several different countries in north america and europe and the interest rate environment differs from country to country 
the company used the following discount rates for its defined benefit pension plans discount rates used for obligations at obligations at obligations at december  and expense december  and expense december  and in in expense in kronos and nl plans germany norway canada us medite plan the assumed long rate return on plan assets represents the estimated average rate of earnings expected to be earned on the funds invested or to be invested in the plans assets provided to fund the benefit payments inherent in the projected benefit obligations 
unlike the discount rate  which is adjusted each year based on changes in current long term interest rates  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets will not necessarily change based upon the actual  short term performance of the plan assets in any given year 
defined benefit pension expense each year is based upon the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for each plan and the actual fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year 
differences between the expected return on plan assets for a given year and the actual return are deferred and amortized over future periods based either upon the expected average remaining service life of the active plan participants for plans for which benefits are still being earned by active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants for plans for which benefits are not still being earned by active employees 
at december   the fair value of plan assets for all defined benefit plans was comprised of million related to us plans and million related to non us plans 
all of such plan assets attributable to non us plans related to plans maintained by kronos  and approximately  and of the plan assets attributable to us plans related to plans maintained by nl and kronos and the medite plan  respectively 
approximately   and of the plan assets attributable to plans maintained by kronos at december  related to kronos plans in germany  norway  canada and the us  respectively 
the medite plan and nl s plans are all in the us the company uses several different long term rates of return on plan asset assumptions in determining its consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense because the company maintains defined benefit pension plans in several different countries in north america and europe  the plan assets in different countries are invested in a different mix of investments and the long term rates of return for different investments differs from country to country 
in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions  the company considers the long term asset mix eg equity vs 
fixed income for the assets for each of its plans and the expected long term rates of return for such asset components 
in addition  the company receives advice about appropriate long term rates of return from the company s third party actuaries 
such assumed asset mixes are summarized below o during  substantially all of the kronos  nl and medite plan assets in the us were invested in the combined master retirement trust cmrt  a collective investment trust established by valhi to permit the collective investment by certain master trusts which fund certain employee benefits plans sponsored by contran and certain of its affiliates 
harold simmons is the sole trustee of the cmrt 
the cmrt s long term investment objective is to provide a rate of return exceeding a composite of broad market equity and fixed income indices including the s p and certain russell indices utilizing both third party investment managers as well as investments directed by mr 
simmons 
during the year history of the cmrt  through december  the average annual rate of return has been approximately 
o in germany  the composition of kronos plan assets is established to satisfy the requirements of the german insurance commissioner 
the current plan asset allocation at december  was to equity managers  to fixed income managers and to real estate 
o in norway  kronos currently has a plan asset target allocation of to equity managers  to fixed income managers and the remainder primarily to cash and liquid investments 
the expected long term rate of return for such investments is approximately  to and  respectively 
the plan asset allocation at december  was to equity managers  to fixed income managers and the remainder primarily to cash and liquid investments 
o in canada  kronos currently has a plan asset target allocation of to equity managers and to fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return for such investments to average approximately basis points above the applicable equity or fixed income index 
the current plan asset allocation at december  was to equity managers and to fixed income managers 
the company regularly reviews its actual asset allocation for each of its plans  and periodically rebalances the investments in each plan to more accurately reflect the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
the assumed long term rates of return on plan assets used for purposes of determining net period pension cost for  and were as follows kronos and nl plans germany norway canada us medite plan the company currently expects to utilize the same long term rates of return on plan asset assumptions in as it used in for purposes of determining the defined benefit pension plan expense 
to the extent that a plan s particular pension benefit formula calculates the pension benefit in whole or in part based upon future compensation levels  the projected benefit obligations and the pension expense will be based in part upon expected increases in future compensation levels 
for all of the company s plans for which the benefit formula is so calculated  the company generally bases the assumed expected increase in future compensation levels based upon average long term inflation rates for the applicable country 
in addition to the actuarial assumptions discussed above  because kronos maintains defined benefit pension plans outside the us  the amount of recognized defined benefit pension expense and the amount of prepaid and accrued pension costs will vary based upon relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
based on the actuarial assumptions described above and kronos current expectations for what actual average foreign currency exchange rates will be during  the company currently expects aggregate defined benefit pension expense will approximate million in in comparison  the company currently expects to be required to make approximately million of aggregate contributions to such plans during as noted above  defined benefit pension expense and the amounts recognized as prepaid and accrued pension costs are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
the company believes all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
if kronos and nl had lowered the assumed discount rates by basis points for all of their plans as of december   their aggregate projected benefit obligations would have increased by approximately million at that date  and their aggregate defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately million during similarly  if kronos and nl lowered the assumed long term rates of return on plan assets by basis points for all of their plans  their defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately  during similar assumed changes with respect to the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets for the medite plan would not be significant 
opeb plans 
certain subsidiaries of the company currently provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   approximately and of the company s aggregate accrued opeb costs relate to nl and kronos  respectively  and substantially all of the remainder relates to tremont 
kronos provides such opeb benefits to retirees in the us  and nl and tremont provide such opeb benefits to retirees in the us the company accounts for such opeb costs under sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
under sfas no 
 opeb expense and accrued opeb costs are based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs 
the company recognized consolidated opeb expense of  in   in and million in similar to defined benefit pension benefits  the amount of funding will differ from the expense recognized for financial reporting purposes  and contributions to the plans to cover benefit payments aggregated million in  million in and million in substantially all of the company s accrued opeb costs relates to benefits being paid to current retirees and their dependents  and no material amount of opeb benefits are being earned by current employees 
as a result  the amount recognized for opeb expense for financial reporting purposes has been  and is expected to continue to be  significantly less than the amount of opeb benefit payments made each year 
accordingly  the amount of accrued opeb costs has been  and is expected to continue to  decline gradually 
the assumed discount rates the company utilizes for determining opeb expense and the related accrued opeb obligations are generally based on the same discount rates the company utilizes for its us and canadian defined benefit pension plans 
in estimating the health care cost trend rate  the company considers its actual health care cost experience  future benefit structures  industry trends and advice from its third party actuaries 
in certain cases  nl has the right to pass on to retirees all or a portion of any increases in health care costs 
during each of the past three years  the company has assumed that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting  among other things  assumed increases in efficiency in the health care system and industry wide cost containment initiatives 
for example  at december   the expected rate of increase in future health care costs ranges from to in  declining to rates of between and in and thereafter 
based on the actuarial assumptions described above and kronos current expectation for what actual average foreign currency exchange rates will be during  the company expects its consolidated opeb expense will approximate  in in comparison  the company expects to be required to make approximately million of contributions to such plans during as noted above  opeb expense and the amount recognized as accrued opeb costs are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
the company believes all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
if the company had lowered the assumed discount rates by basis points for all of its opeb plans as of december   the company s aggregate projected benefit obligations would have increased by approximately million at that date  and the company s opeb expense would be expected to increase by less than  during similarly  if the assumed future health care cost trend rate had been increased by basis points  the company s accumulated opeb obligations would have increased by approximately million at december   and opeb expense would have increased by  in foreign operations kronos 
kronos has substantial operations located outside the united states principally europe and canada for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 
as a result  the reported amount of kronos assets and liabilities related to its non us operations  and therefore the company s consolidated net assets  will fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates 
at december   kronos had substantial net assets denominated in the euro  canadian dollar  norwegian kroner and british pound sterling 
compx 
compx has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states  principally slide and or ergonomic product operations in canada and taiwan 
timet 
timet also has substantial operations and assets located in europe  principally in the united kingdom  france and italy 
the united kingdom has not adopted the euro 
approximately of timet s european sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the british pound and the euro 
certain purchases of raw materials for timet s european operations  principally titanium sponge and alloys  are denominated in us dollars while labor and other production costs are primarily denominated in local currencies 
the us dollar value of timet s foreign sales and operating costs are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations that can impact reported earnings 
liquidity and capital resources summary the company s primary source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is its cash flows from operating activities  which is generally used to i fund capital expenditures  ii repay short term indebtedness incurred primarily for working capital purposes and iii provide for the payment of dividends including dividends paid to valhi by its subsidiaries 
in addition  from time to time the company will incur indebtedness  generally to i fund short term working capital needs  ii refinance existing indebtedness  iii make investments in marketable and other securities including the acquisition of securities issued by subsidiaries and affiliates of the company or iv fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business 
also  the company will from time to time sell assets outside the ordinary course of business  the proceeds of which are generally used to i repay existing indebtedness including indebtedness which may have been collateralized by the assets sold  ii make investments in marketable and other securities  iii fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business or iv pay dividends 
at december   the company s third party indebtedness was substantially comprised of i valhi s million of loans from snake river sugar company due in  ii kii s euro denominated senior secured notes equivalent of million principal amount outstanding due in and iii kii s european credit facility the equivalent of million outstanding due in june kii expects to seek a renewal of its european credit facility during the first half of accordingly  the company does not currently expect that a significant amount of its cash flows from operating activities generated during will be required to be used to repay indebtedness during based upon the company s expectations for the industries in which its subsidiaries and affiliates operate  and the anticipated demands on the company s cash resources as discussed herein  the company expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations including operations  capital expenditures  debt service and current dividend policy 
to the extent that actual developments differ from the company s expectations  the company s liquidity could be adversely affected 
consolidated cash flows operating activities 
trends in cash flows from operating activities excluding the impact of significant asset dispositions and relative changes in assets and liabilities are generally similar to trends in the company s earnings 
however  certain items included in the determination of net income are non cash  and therefore such items have no impact on cash flows from operating activities 
non cash items included in the determination of net income include depreciation and amortization expense  non cash interest expense  asset impairment charges and unrealized securities transactions gains and losses 
non cash interest expense relates principally to valhi and kronos and consists of amortization of original issue discount or premium on certain indebtedness and amortization of deferred financing costs 
certain other items included in the determination of net income may have an impact on cash flows from operating activities  but the impact of such items on cash flows from operating activities will differ from their impact on net income 
for example  equity in earnings of affiliates will generally differ from the amount of distributions received from such affiliates  and equity in losses of affiliates does not necessarily result in current cash outlays paid to such affiliates 
the amount of periodic defined benefit pension plan expense and periodic opeb expense depends upon a number of factors  including certain actuarial assumptions  and changes in such actuarial assumptions will result in a change in the reported expense 
in addition  the amount of such periodic expense generally differs from the outflows of cash required to be currently paid for such benefits 
also  proceeds from the disposal of marketable securities classified as trading securities are reported as a component of cash flows from operating activities  and such proceeds will generally differ from the amount of the related gain or loss on disposal 
certain other items included in the determination of net income have no impact on cash flows from operating activities  but such items do impact cash flows from investing activities although their impact on such cash flows differs from their impact on net income 
for example  realized gains and losses from the disposal of available for sale marketable securities and long lived assets are included in the determination of net income  although the proceeds from any such disposal are shown as part of cash flows from investing activities 
changes in product pricing  production volumes and customer demand  among other things  can significantly affect the liquidity of the company 
relative changes in assets and liabilities generally result from the timing of production  sales  purchases and income tax payments 
such relative changes can significantly impact the comparability of cash flow from operations from period to period  as the income statement impact of such items may occur in a different period from when the underlying cash transaction occurs 
for example  raw materials may be purchased in one period  but the payment for such raw materials may occur in a subsequent period 
similarly  inventory may be sold in one period  but the cash collection of the receivable may occur in a subsequent period 
relative changes in accounts receivable are affected by  among other things  the timing of sales and the collection of the resulting receivable

examples of such proposed legislation include bills which would permit civil liability for damages on the basis of market share  rather than requiring plaintiffs to prove that the defendant s product caused the alleged damage  and bills which would revive actions barred by the statute of limitations

tremont llc see note to the consolidated financial statements for certain legal proceedings and environmental matters with respect to tremont 
general corporate valhi because valhi s operations are conducted primarily through its subsidiaries and affiliates  valhi s long term ability to meet its parent company level corporate obligations is dependent in large measure on the receipt of dividends or other distributions from its subsidiaries and affiliates 
in february  kronos announced it would pay its first regular quarterly cash dividend of 
per share 
at that rate  and based on the million shares of kronos held by valhi and tremont at december  million shares held by valhi and million shares held by tremont  a wholly owned subsidiary of valhi  valhi would receive aggregate annual dividends from kronos of million 
nl  which paid regular quarterly cash dividends of 
per share in  has paid its regular quarterly dividends of 
per share in the form of shares of kronos common stock 
nl increased its regular quarterly dividend in the first quarter of to 
per share 
the company does not currently expect to receive any distributions from waste control specialists during compx dividends  which resumed in the fourth quarter of  are paid to nl 
various credit agreements to which certain subsidiaries or affiliates are parties contain customary limitations on the payment of dividends  typically a percentage of net income or cash flow  however  such restrictions in the past have not significantly impacted valhi s ability to service its parent company level obligations 
valhi generally does not guarantee any indebtedness or other obligations of its subsidiaries or affiliates 
to the extent that one or more of valhi s subsidiaries were to become unable to maintain its current level of dividends  either due to restrictions contained in the applicable subsidiary s credit agreements or otherwise  valhi parent company s liquidity could become adversely impacted 
in such an event  valhi might consider reducing or eliminating its dividends or selling interests in subsidiaries or other assets 
at december   valhi had million of parent level cash and cash equivalents and had no amounts outstanding under its revolving bank credit agreement 
in addition  valhi had million of borrowing availability under its revolving bank credit facility  and valhi had million in short term demand loans to contran 
as noted above  in september nl completed the acquisition of the shares of compx common stock previously held by valhi and valcor 
the purchase price for these shares was paid by nl s transfer to valhi and valcor of an aggregate million of nl s note receivable from kronos million to valcor and million to valhi

the remainder of such funds are available for valhi s general corporate purposes 
the terms of the amalgamated sugar company llc company agreement provide for annual base level of cash dividend distributions sometimes referred to as distributable cash by the llc of million  from which the company is entitled to a preferential share 
distributions from the llc are dependent  in part  upon the operations of the llc 
the company records dividend distributions from the llc as income upon receipt  which occurs in the same month in which they are declared by the llc 
to the extent the llc s distributable cash is below this base level in any given year  the company is entitled to an additional preferential share of any future annual llc distributable cash in excess of the base level until such shortfall is recovered 
based on the llc s current projections for  valhi currently expects that distributions received from the llc in will approximate its debt service requirements under its million loans from snake river sugar company 
certain covenants contained in snake river s third party senior debt allow snake river to pay periodic installments of debt service payments principal and interest under valhi s million loan to snake river prior to its current scheduled maturity in  and such loan is subordinated to snake river s third party senior debt 
at december   the accrued and unpaid interest on the million loan to snake river aggregated million and is classified as a noncurrent asset 
the company currently believes it will ultimately realize both the million principal amount and the accrued and unpaid interest  whether through cash generated from the future operations of snake river and the llc or otherwise including any liquidation of snake river or the llc 
following the currently scheduled complete repayment of snake river s third party senior debt in april  valhi believes it will receive significant debt service payments on its loan to snake river as the cash flows that snake river previously would have been using to fund debt service on its third party senior debt million of scheduled payments in  plus other cash resources at snake river would then become available  and would be required  to be used to fund debt service payments on its loan from valhi 
prior to the repayment of the third party senior debt  snake river might also make debt service payments to valhi  if permitted by the terms of the senior debt  or if snake river would refinance with a third party all or a portion of the amounts it owes to valhi under such million loan 
the company may  at its option  require the llc to redeem the company s interest in the llc beginning in  and the llc has the right to redeem the company s interest in the llc beginning in the redemption price is generally million plus the amount of certain undistributed income allocable to the company 
in the event the company requires the llc to redeem the company s interest in the llc  snake river has the right to accelerate the maturity of and call valhi s million loans from snake river 
redemption of the company s interest in the llc would result in the company reporting income related to the disposition of its llc interest for both financial reporting and income tax purposes 
however  because of snake river s ability to call its million loans to valhi upon redemption of the company s interest in the llc  the net cash proceeds after repayment of the debt generated by redemption of the company s interest in the llc could be less than the income taxes that would become payable as a result of the disposition

from time to time  the company and related entities also evaluate the restructuring of ownership interests among their respective subsidiaries and related companies 
non gaap financial measures in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company s results of operations as determined by gaap  the company has disclosed certain non gaap information which the company believes provides useful information to investors o the company discloses percentage changes in kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies  which excludes the effects of foreign currency translation 
the company believes disclosure of such percentage changes allows investors to analyze such changes without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of the relative changes in average selling prices in the actual various billing currencies 
generally  when the us dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies  the percentage change in average selling prices in billing currencies will be higher or lower  respectively  than such percentage changes would be using actual exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods

other than the contracts discussed below  the company was not a party to any forward or derivative option contract related to foreign exchange rates  interest rates or equity security prices at december  and see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the financial instruments to which the company is a party at december  and interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness and certain interest bearing notes receivable 
at december   the company s aggregate indebtedness was split between of fixed rate instruments and of variable rate borrowings of fixed rate instruments and of variable rate borrowings 
the large percentage of fixed rate debt instruments minimizes earnings volatility which would result from changes in interest rates 
the following table presents principal amounts and weighted average interest rates for the company s aggregate outstanding indebtedness at december  information shown below for such foreign currency denominated indebtedness is presented in its us dollar equivalent at december  using exchange rates of us dollars per euro 
amount carrying fair interest maturity indebtedness value value rate date in millions fixed rate indebtedness euro denominated kii senior secured notes valhi loans from snake river other 

various variable rate indebtedness kii euro denominated european revolver denominated in us dollars  except as otherwise indicated 
at december   fixed rate indebtedness aggregated million fair value million with a weighted average interest rate of  variable rate indebtedness at such date aggregated million  which approximates fair value  with a weighted average interest rate of 
such fixed rate indebtedness was denominated in the euro of the total or the us dollars 
at december   all outstanding fixed rate indebtedness was denominated in us dollars or the euro  and the outstanding variable rate borrowings were denominated in us dollars 
the company has an million loan to snake river sugar company at december  and such loan bears interest at a fixed interest rate of at such dates  the estimated fair value of such loan aggregated million and million at december  and  respectively 
the potential decrease in the fair value of such loan resulting from a hypothetical basis point increase in market interest rates would be approximately million at december  million 
foreign currency exchange rates 
the company is exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling its products worldwide 
earnings are primarily affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro  the canadian dollar  the norwegian kroner and the british pound sterling 
as described above  at december   kronos had the equivalent of million of outstanding euro denominated indebtedness the equivalent of million of euro denominated indebtedness 
the potential increase in the us dollar equivalent of the principal amount outstanding resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates at such date would be approximately million at december  million 
certain of compx s sales generated by its canadian operations are denominated in us dollars 
to manage a portion of the foreign exchange rate market risk associated with such receivables or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales  at december  compx had entered into a series of short term forward exchange contracts maturing through march to exchange an aggregate of million for an equivalent amount of canadian dollars at an exchange rates of cdn 
to cdn 
per us dollar contracts to exchange an aggregate of million for an equivalent amount of canadian dollars maturing through february 
the estimated fair value of such forward exchange contracts at december  and is not material 
at december   kronos also had entered into a short term currency forward contract maturing on january  to exchange an aggregate of euro million into us dollars at an exchange rate of us per euro 
such contract was entered into in conjunction with the january payment of an intercompany dividend from one of kronos european subsidiaries 
at december   the actual exchange rate was us per euro 
the estimated fair value of such foreign currency forward contract was not material at december  kronos was not a party to such a contract at december  marketable equity and debt security prices 
the company is exposed to market risk due to changes in prices of the marketable securities which are owned 
the fair value of such debt and equity securities at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the potential change in the aggregate fair value of these investments  assuming a change in prices  would be million at december  and million at december  other 
the company believes there may be a certain amount of incompleteness in the sensitivity analyses presented above 
for example  the hypothetical effect of changes in interest rates discussed above ignores the potential effect on other variables which affect the company s results of operations and cash flows  such as demand for the company s products  sales volumes and selling prices and operating expenses 
contrary to the above assumptions  changes in interest rates rarely result in simultaneous comparable shifts along the yield curve 
also  certain of the company s marketable securities are exchangeable for certain of the company s debt instruments  and a decrease in the fair value of such securities would likely be mitigated by a decrease in the fair value of the related indebtedness 
accordingly  the amounts presented above are not necessarily an accurate reflection of the potential losses the company would incur assuming the hypothetical changes in market prices were actually to occur 
the above discussion and estimated sensitivity analysis amounts include forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in market prices 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by the company of future events  gains or losses
