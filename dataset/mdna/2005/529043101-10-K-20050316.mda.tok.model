item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company  which has elected to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the internal revenue code of  acquires and manages net leased commercial properties throughout the united states 
the company believes it has operated as a reit since october as of december   the company owned or had interests in real estate properties encompassing million rentable square feet 
during  the company purchased properties  including non consolidated investments  for a capitalized cost of million 
during  the company sold eight properties to unrelated third parties for net sales price of million 
in addition  the company contributed eight properties to its various joint venture programs for million which approximated carrying costs 
in addition  the company was reimbursed for certain holding costs by the partners in the joint ventures 
as of december   the company leased properties to tenants in different industries 
the company s revenues and cash flows are generated predominantly from property rent receipts 
growth in revenue and cash flows is directly correlated to the company s ability to i acquire income producing properties and ii to release properties that are vacant  or may become vacant at favorable rental rates 
the challenge the company faces in purchasing properties is finding investments that will provide an attractive return without compromising the company s real estate underwriting criteria 
the company believes it has access to acquisition opportunities due to its relationship with developers  brokers  corporate users and sellers 
in the past three years  the company has experienced minimal lease turnover  and accordingly minimal capital expenditures 
there can be no assurance that this will continue 
through  the company  including its non consolidated entities  has leases expiring which generate approximately million in base rent  including the company s proportion share of base rent from non consolidated entities 
releasing these properties at favorable effective rates is the primary focus of the company 
the primary risks associated with re tenanting properties are i the period of time required to find a new tenant ii whether rental rates will be lower than previously received iii the significant leasing costs such as commissions and tenant improvement allowances and iv the payment of operating costs such as real estate taxes and insurance while there is no offsetting revenue 
the company addresses these risks by contacting tenants well in advance of lease maturity to get an understanding of their occupancy needs  contacting local brokers to determine the depth of the rental market and  if required  retaining local expertise to assist in the re tenanting of a property 
as part of the acquisition underwriting process  the company focuses on buying general purpose real estate which can be leased to other tenants without significant modification to the properties 
no assurance can be given that once a property becomes vacant it will subsequently be re let 
during  the company sold four properties for million to unrelated parties  which resulted in an aggregate gain of approximately million 
during  the company sold five properties for million to unrelated parties  which resulted in an aggregate gain of approximately million 
during  the company contributed properties to lion for million  which approximated carrying costs 
critical accounting policies the company s accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities reported 
the following are 
table of contents critical accounting policies which are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and which require some of management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
the accounting for these matters involves the making of estimates based on current facts  circumstances and assumptions which could change in a manner that would materially affect management s future estimate with respect to such matters 
accordingly  future reported financial conditions and results could differ materially from financial conditions and results reported based on management s current estimates 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for leases  as amended sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that revenue be recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the time pattern in which the use benefit is derived from the leased property 
leases that include renewal options with rental terms that are lower than those in the primary term are excluded from the calculation of straight line rent if they do not meet the criteria of a bargain renewal option 
gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for sales of real estate  as amended 
the specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in sfas no 
related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties 
if the sales criteria are not met  the gain is deferred and the finance  installment or cost recovery method  as appropriate  is applied until the sales criteria are met 
accounts receivable 
the company continuously monitors collections from its tenants and would make a provision for estimated losses based upon historical experience and any specific tenant collection issues that the company has identified 
as of december  and  the company did not record an allowance for doubtful accounts 
purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate 
the fair value of the real estate acquired  which includes the impact of mark to market adjustments for assumed mortgage debt relating to property acquisitions  is allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  other value of in place leases and value of tenant relationships  based in each case on their fair values 
the fair value of the tangible assets  which includes land  building and improvements  and fixtures and equipment  of an acquired property is determined to valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to the tangible assets based on management s determination of relative fair values of these assets 
factors considered by management in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease up periods based on current market demand 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions 
in allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property  above market and below market in place lease values are recorded based on the difference between the current in place lease rent and a management estimate of current market rents 
below market lease intangibles are recorded as part of deferred revenue and amortized into rental revenue over the non cancelable periods of the respective leases 
above market leases are recorded as part of intangible assets and amortized as a direct charge against rental revenue over the non cancelable portion of the respective leases 
the aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets  consisting of in place leases and tenant relationships  is measured by the excess of i the purchase price paid for a property over ii the estimated fair value of the property as if vacant  determined as set forth above 
this aggregate value is allocated between in place lease values and tenant relationships based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease 
the value of in place leases and customer relationships are amortized to expense over the remaining non cancelable periods of the respective leases 

table of contents impairment of real estate 
annually  and if events and circumstances require  the company evaluates the carrying value of its real estate held to determine if an impairment has occurred which would require the recognition of a loss 
the evaluation includes reviewing anticipated cash flows of the property  based on current leases in place  coupled with an estimate of proceeds to be realized upon sale 
however  estimating future sale proceeds is highly subjective and such estimates could differ materially from actual results 
properties held for sale 
the company accounts for properties held for sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 as amended accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas requires that the assets and liabilities of properties that meet various criteria in sfas no

liquidity and capital resources since becoming a public company  the company s principal sources of capital for growth has been the public and private equity markets  selective secured indebtedness  its unsecured credit facility  issuance of op units and undistributed funds from operations 
the company expects to continue to have access to and use these sources in the future  however  there are factors that may have a material adverse effect on the company s access to capital sources 
the company s ability to incur additional debt to fund acquisitions is dependent upon its existing leverage  the value of the assets the company is attempting to leverage and general economic conditions which may be outside of management s influence 
the company s current million variable rate unsecured revolving credit facility  which is scheduled to expire in august  has made available funds to finance acquisitions and meet any short term working capital requirements 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding 
the company did have million in outstanding letters of credit under the facility

during  the company completed a million common share offering and a million common share offering raising an aggregate of million of net proceeds 
the company completed a million redeemable preferred share offering with a cumulative preferred dividend rate of raising net proceeds of million 
the proceeds of these offerings were used to repay debt and fund acquisitions 
the company has made equity commitments of million to its various joint venture programs  of which million is unfunded as of december  this amount will be funded as investments are made 
in addition  the joint venture agreements provide the partners  under certain circumstances  the ability to put their interests to the company for cash or commons shares 
this put could require the company to use its resources to purchase these assets instead of more favorable investment opportunities 
the aggregate contingent commitment as of december  is approximately million 
dividends 
in connection with its intention to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  the company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its shareholders 
these dividends are 
table of contents expected to be paid from operating cash flows and or from other sources 
since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investments  the company generally intends to maintain a conservative dividend payout ratio as a percentage of ffo  reserving such amounts as it considers necessary for the maintenance or expansion of properties in its portfolio  debt reduction  the acquisition of interests in new properties as suitable opportunities arise  and such other factors as the board of trustees considers appropriate 
dividends paid to common shareholders increased to million in  compared to million in and million in preferred dividends paid were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
although the company receives the majority of its base rent payments on a monthly basis  it intends to continue paying dividends quarterly 
amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution are invested by the company in short term money market or other suitable instruments 
on november   the tenant in the company s dallas  texas property  vartec telcom  inc  filed for chapter bankruptcy and subsequently rejected its lease with the company 
the lease  provided for million in annual base rent and million in annual cash rent 
in addition  under the terms of the lease the tenant was responsible for all operating expenses of the property 
as the tenant has rejected the lease  in addition to the loss of base rent  the company will be responsible for operating expenses until a replacement tenant can be found 
the company has assessed the recoverability of this asset  which it is holding for investment  and believes it is not impaired as of december  the company has written off million in other assets relating to this bankruptcy 
the company believes that cash flows from operations will continue to provide adequate capital to fund its operating and administrative expenses  regular debt service obligations and all dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements in both the short term and long term 
in addition  the company anticipates that cash on hand  borrowings under its unsecured credit facility  issuance of equity and debt  as well as other alternatives  will provide the necessary capital required by the company 
cash flows from operations as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows increased to million for from million for and million for cash flows from operations was negatively impacted in and by the payment of million and  million respectively in prepayment penalties on debt satisfactions 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in  million in and million in cash used in investing activities relates primarily to investments in real estate properties and joint ventures 
therefore  the fluctuation in investing activities relates primarily to the timing of investments and dispositions 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million in  million in and million in cash provided by financing activities during each year was primarily attributable to proceeds from equity offerings  non recourse mortgages and advances repayments under the company s credit facility offset by dividend and distribution payments and mortgage principal payments 
upreit structure 
the company s upreit structure permits the company to effect acquisitions by issuing to a property owner  as a form of consideration in exchange for the property  op units in partnerships controlled by the company 
all of such op units are redeemable at certain times for common shares on a one for one basis and all of such op units require the company to pay certain distributions to the holders of such op units 
the company accounts for these op units in a manner similar to a minority interest holder 
the number of common shares that will be outstanding in the future should be expected to increase  and minority interest expense should be expected to decrease  as such op units are redeemed for common shares

current total annualized current total per op annualized redeemable for number affiliate unit distribution common shares of op units op units distribution at any time at any time at any time march march january january february may may november affiliate op units  which are included in total op units  represent op units held by two executive officers including their affiliates of the company 
financing revolving credit facility 
the company s million unsecured credit facility  which expires august and can be extended by the company for one year with a payment of million  bears interest at basis points over libor depending on the amount of properties the company owns free and clear of mortgage debt  and has an interest rate period of one  three  or six months  at the option of the company 
the credit facility contains various leverage  debt service coverage  net worth maintenance and other customary covenants 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding and million was available to be drawn 
the company has five outstanding letters of credit aggregating million issued in accordance with provisions in certain non recourse mortgages  which expire at various dates ranging from to  under the facility 
debt service requirements 
the company s principal liquidity needs are the payment of interest and principal on outstanding indebtedness 
as of december   a total of of the company s consolidated properties  were subject to outstanding mortgages which had an aggregate principal amount of million  including properties included in discontinued operations 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate on the company s outstanding debt  was approximately 
the scheduled principal amortization payments for the next five years are as follows million in  million in  million in  million in and million in approximate balloon payment amounts  having a weighted average interest rate of  due the next five years are as follows million in  in  in  million in and million in the ability of the company to make such balloon payments will depend upon its ability to refinance the mortgage related thereto  sell the related property  have available amounts under its unsecured credit facility or access other capital 
the ability of the company to accomplish such goals will be affected by numerous economic factors affecting the real estate industry  including the availability and cost of mortgage debt at the time  the company s equity in the mortgaged properties  the financial condition of the company  the operating history of the mortgaged properties  the then current tax laws and the general national  regional and local economic conditions 

table of contents the company expects to continue to use property specific  non recourse mortgages as it believes that by properly matching a debt obligation  including the balloon maturity risk  with a lease expiration the company s cash on cash returns increase and the exposure to residual valuation risk is reduced 
other lease obligations 
since the company s tenants generally bear all or substantially all of the cost of property operations  maintenance and repairs  the company does not anticipate significant needs for cash for these costs 
for eight of the properties  the company has a level of property operating expense responsibility 
the company generally funds property expansions with additional secured borrowings  the repayment of which is funded out of rental increases under the leases covering the expanded properties 
to the extent there is a vacancy in a property  the company would be obligated for all operating expenses  including real estate taxes and insurance

these revenue sources were partly offset by an increase in i interest expense of million due to partial funding of acquisitions with the use of non recourse mortgage debt  ii depreciation expense of million due to more depreciable assets owned  and iii property operating expenses of million 
any increase in net income in future periods will be closely tied to the level of acquisitions made by the company

inflation 
the company s long term leases contain provisions to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on its operating results 
such provisions include clauses entitling the company to receive i scheduled fixed base rent increases and ii base rent increases based upon the consumer price index 
in addition  the majority of the company s leases require tenants to pay operating expenses  including maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
environmental matters 
based upon management s ongoing review of its properties  management is not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of the company s properties  which would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company
