mfc s cable tv product sales increased  or to  during the fiscal year ended september  when compared to cable tv product sales of  during the fiscal year ended september  the increase in sales can be attributed to the improved economy mitigating any drop off in demand due to the transition from analog to digital television 
digital televison dtv is a new type of broadcasting technology that will transform television viewing 
dtv enables broadcasters to offer television with movie quality picture and sound 
it also offers greater multicasting and interactive capabilities 
dtv is a more flexible and efficient technology than the current ntsc analog broadcast system 
rather than being limited to providing one analog programming channel  a broadcaster will be able to provide a super sharp high definition hdtv program or multiple standard definition dtv programs simultaneously using the rf spectrum more efficiently 
providing several program streams on one broadcast channel is called multicasting 
the number of programs a station can send on one digital channel depends on the level of picture detail  also known as resolution 
dtv can provide interactive video and data services that are not possible with analog technology 
converting to dtv will eventually free up parts of the scarce and valuable broadcast airwaves 
those portions of the spectrum can then be used for other important services  such as advanced wireless and public safety services police  fire  rescue squads  etc televison stations serving all markets in the united states are currently airing digital television programming  although they still must provide analog programming until the target date set by congress for completion of the transition to dtv april  that date may be extended  however  until most homes in an area are able to watch the dtv programming 
at that point  broadcasting on the current analog channels will end and that spectrum will be put to other uses reducing the need for analog filters which mfc currently supplies 
until the transition to dtv is complete  television stations will continue broadcasting on both their digital and analog channels 
mfc has developed and is supplying filters for digital television  however  the demand for these filters is unknown at this time 
mfc s rf microwave product sales increased  or to  during the fiscal year ended september  when compared to sales of  during the fiscal year ended september  these products are primarily sold to original equipment manufacturers oems that serve the mobile radio and commercial and defense electronics markets

the company continues to invest in production engineering and infrastructure development to penetrate oem market segments as they become popular 
mfc is concentrating its technical resources and product development efforts toward potential high volume customers as part of a concentrated effort to provide substantial long term growth 
mfc s satellite product sales decreased  or to  during the fiscal year ended september  when compared to  during the fiscal year ended september  the decrease can be attributed to a decrease in demand for the company s filters which suppress strong out of band interference caused by military and civilian radar systems and other sources 
despite the slight decrease in sales  management expects demand for these types of filters to continue with the proliferation of earth stations world wide and increased sources of interference

niagara scientific  inc nsi sales decreased  or to  for the fiscal year ended september  when compared to sales of  for the fiscal year ended september  sales of nsi related equipment can be impacted by the timing of the shipment of the custom designed equipment and the customer s scheduled delivery dates 
nsi s sales order levels have been negatively impacted by the sluggish economy and reduced capital spending

due to the uncertain economic climate  the company has been emphasizing cost controls and cost cutting measures to minimize operating expenses 
income from operations increased  to a loss from operations of  during the fiscal year ended september  when compared to a loss from operations of  during the fiscal year ended september  the improvement can primarily be attributed to the improved gross margins and the reductions in sg a expenses this year when compared to the same period last year 
on an industry segment basis  mfc s income from operations increased  to income from operations of  for the fiscal year ended september  compared to a loss from operations of  for the fiscal year ended september  due primarily to the mfc s higher sales volume and reduced operating expenses 
nsi recorded a loss from operations of  for the fiscal year ended september  compared to a loss from operations of  for the fiscal year ended september  nsi s improvement can primarily be attributed to planned reductions in operating expenses 
nsi s losses from operations can partly be attributed to the absorption of fixed overhead expenses 
as a result of the company s cumulative losses  the company recorded a non cash charge to establish a valuation allowance of  against net deferred tax assets for the fiscal year ended september  the charge was calculated in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
evidence  such as operating results during the most recent three year period  is given more weight when due to our current lack of visibility  there is a greater degree of uncertainty that the level of future profitability needed to record the deferred tax assets will be achieved 
our results over the most recent three year period have been negatively affected by the downturn in the telecommunications marketplace  the sluggish economy and reduced capital spending 
the company s losses in the most recent three year period  inclusive of the loss for the fiscal year ended september   represented sufficient negative evidence to require a valuation allowance under the provisions of sfas the company will maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reduction or reversal 
the company recorded a provision for income taxes of  for the fiscal year ended september  compared to a benefit for income taxes of  for the fiscal year ended september  the change can primarily be attributed to the company providing a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets and the lower pre tax loss this year when compared to the same period last year

the company s primary source of liquidity has been funds provided by operations 
september cash cash equivalents    investments    working capital    current ratio to to to long term debt cash and cash equivalents increased  to  at september  when compared to  at september  the increase was a result of  in net cash provided by operating activities   in net cash used in investing activities and  in net cash provided by financing activities 
the positive cash flow from operations was primarily due to income before depreciation 
the net increase of  in accounts receivable at september   when compared to september   can primarily be attributed to the increase in shipments during the month ended september  when compared to the month ended september  the net decrease of  in inventories at september   when compared to september   can primarily be attributed to the scheduled delivery of nsi s sales order backlog of september  during the quarter ended december  the company provides for a valuation reserve for certain inventory that is deemed to be obsolete  of excess quantity or otherwise impaired 
the company s inventory valuation reserves equaled  at september  compared to  at september  the decrease of  in inventory reserves at september   when compared to september   can primarily be attributed to the disposal of specific inventory items due to obsolescence 
based on current and expected inventory levels  management believes any change to the inventory valuation reserves will not have a material impact on future results of operations  capital resources or liquidity 
all such inventory items are written down to their estimated net realizable value 
the net increase in other current assets of  at september   when compared to september   can primarily be attributed to an increase in prepaid expenses due primarily to increased costs and the timing of the payments when compared to last year 
the decrease of  in customer deposits at september   when compared to september   can primarily be attributed to the shipment of nsi s sales order backlog of september  during the quarter ended december  the net increase of  in other current liabilities at september   when compared to september   can primarily be attributed to the company s discretionary profit sharing contribution of  accrued at september  compared to at september  and an increase in accrued sales commissions payable at september  due to the higher commissionable sales during the quarter ended september  when compared to last year

critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported 
the company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to gaap and are consistently applied 
valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness and adequacy on a consistent basis throughout the company 
primary areas where financial information of the company is subject to the use of estimates  assumptions and the application of judgment include revenues  receivables  inventories  and taxes 
revenues from product sales are recorded as the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  provided that no significant vendor or post contract support obligations remain and the collection of the related receivable is probable 
billings in advance of the company s performance of such work are reflected as customer deposits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
allowances for doubtful accounts are based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
the company s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the company uses certain estimates and judgments and considers several factors including product demand and changes in technology to provide for excess and obsolescence reserves to properly value inventory 
the company established a warranty reserve which provides for the estimated cost of product returns based upon historical experience and any known conditions or circumstances 
our warranty obligation is affected by product that does not meet specifications and performance requirements and any related costs of addressing such matters 
the company has deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly 
these assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
valuations related to tax accruals and assets can be impacted by changes to tax codes  changes in statutory tax rates and the company s future taxable income levels
