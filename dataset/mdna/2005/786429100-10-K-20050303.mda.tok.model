we are a property and casualty p c insurance company with headquarters in seattle  washington 
we sell insurance to drivers  home owners and small and medium sized businesses through a national network of distributors 
our business helps people protect what they value and deal with the unexpected 
we earn revenue from insurance policy premiums and income on our invested assets 
in  we sold our life investments operations 
we rolled out safeco now  our unified  web based sales and service platform  and we reorganized our company around the way we operate 
with these actions  we are a focused  more nimble p c company 
reviewing our results of operations our financial results for the last three years have been affected by the major strategic actions we have taken to turn our company around  reshape our business and become a more focused and successful competitor 
in  our major strategic initiatives included focusing on p c operations increasing efficiency for our distribution partners meeting the needs of our customers at a fair price refining our business model further 
table of contents focusing on p c operations during  we completed the sale of our life investments l i businesses 
four critical ideas led us to pursue the sale of l i the low interest rate environment  limited investment returns and weakened l i earnings relative to our p c lines our belief that relentless focus on what we do best drives the greatest benefits for safeco and our shareholders competing in multiple insurance sectors increased the complexity of our business  which in turn increased our costs competitors of l i delivered better results  despite the adverse conditions affecting all players in the life and investments business we used the  proceeds of the sale to return our debt to capital ratios to pre sale levels and return excess capital to our shareholders 
specifically  we used  including transaction costs  to repurchase of debt  resulting in a pretax after tax loss on debt repurchases 
including transaction costs we used to execute an accelerated stock buyback asb program of  shares and we retained the balance for future flexibility and to pay transaction related expenses 
increasing efficiency for our distribution partners in  we brought our major products together on safeco now  our automated sales and service platform 
safeco now features a single point of entry for personal auto  homeowners  most small commercial products and certain surety bonds 
this allows our distributors to quote and issue these products in minutes 
products currently available on safeco now include auto  homeowners  dwelling fire  business owner policies  commercial auto  workers compensation and commercial multi peril 
we also launched our policy change tool for handling certain simple but frequent personal auto policy endorsements 
meeting the needs of our customers at a fair price we offer a competitively priced product through the sophistication of our automated underwriting models using safeco now  which enables us to appropriately match price to risk 
we also focus on outstanding service by measuring ourselves against a zero defect standard in our service transactions 
these service transactions include our gold service program  which provides fee based full service customer support on behalf of our distribution partners through our regional service centers 
we deploy a team of nearly  claims professionals across the country to deliver our most visible product the personalized service and support we provide when customers experience a loss and file a claim 
in addition  our expense reduction efforts that began in reduced our operating expenses by approximately  primarily by eliminating approximately positions in our corporate departments 
our cost reductions and ongoing expense discipline help us provide competitively priced products 
refining our business model further our market advantage is sustained by how we do business offering standardized auto  homeowners and small commercial insurance products over a unified sales and service platform through a common independent distribution network 
to fully leverage this business model  in  we realigned our organization around these three areas 
here s a closer look at the key elements of our business model product we focus on the personal and commercial insurance products purchased by the vast majority of us consumers 
we call these standardized products because they don t require significant customization  and they re well suited to automated underwriting and sales and service support 
our claims operation  with its front line experience and insight  is tightly aligned with our product development and underwriting teams 
we continually work to refine our segmented pricing models and accurately match rate to risk 

table of contents platform we deliver our products over our automated platform called safeco now  which gives our distribution partners a single point of entry to quote and issue our major p c products in a matter of minutes 
most of our pricing  underwriting and servicing processes are now presented through this user friendly interface 
in addition to technology  our platform encompasses the people and processes that make our company go including the personalized support our service professionals provide to distributors and customers  the financial strength that gives us the capital we need to invest in our company  the physical infrastructure required to run the business  and the recruitment and development of the talented people of safeco 
distribution we sell our insurance products exclusively through a national network of  independent distributors that provides customers with choice and advice 
we motivate our distributors by giving them more to sell multiple lines of personal and commercial insurance  making it easier for them to sell through technology and other ease of business tools  helping them make more money selling our products through increased operational efficiencies and providing competitive compensation programs 
in  our major strategic initiatives included focusing on p c operations reducing expenses partnering with independent distributors selling standardized products offering multiple p c product lines focusing on p c operations on september   we announced our decision to focus on our p c operations and put our l i businesses up for sale 
this sale was subsequently completed in august reducing expenses we identified expense reductions across the company to enable us to better compete in the property and casualty insurance markets 
we announced that we would eliminate approximately positions in our corporate departments  and we completed this in march partnering with independent distributors our strategy focuses on providing more products for our distributors to sell and providing ease of doing business tools that drive greater operating efficiencies in their offices 
our distributors can be more profitable selling our products through use of safeco now  and our commission programs are structured to incent profitable growth 
in short  we offer our distribution partners more products to sell  make it easier for them to sell and service these products  and help our distributors make more money selling our products 
selling standardized products our standardized auto  homeowners and small business products have been designed to serve the insurance needs of the majority of the individuals and small to medium sized businesses in the us marketplace 
offering multiple p c product lines we believe our ability to provide multiple p c products gives us a shelf space advantage in our distributors offices 
our auto  homeowners and small business insurance products represent the products our distribution partners sell most 
these product lines generally represent more than of the insurance revenues sold in our distributors offices 

table of contents in  we reshaped our p c business to improve profitability and position our company for growth 
our major strategic actions included improving sales growth through independent distributors driving execution through enhanced metrics improving service and claims handling strengthening our financial position investing in our employees improving sales growth through independent distributors we began the rollout of our automated underwriting platform 
this technology made it easier for distribution partners to sell all our primary product lines auto  homeowners and small business insurance 
driving execution through enhanced metrics we established financial metrics for the company and each business unit 
we developed individual goals that aligned the performance of the workforce with the company and operating unit metrics 
we also shifted to a monthly financial close to better understand and act on results 
improving service and claims handling we launched a multi year training effort to drive out errors from our processes involving customers 
we initiated projects to eliminate mistakes that degrade service and waste money 
strengthening our financial position we took a number of actions  including replacing our short term commercial paper borrowings with long term senior notes and developing a plan to refinance of long term debt  issuing common stock and strengthening the capital base of our operations  and repositioning our investment portfolio  reducing risk and volatility 
investing in our employees we implemented a total performance management system that encompasses goal setting  employee development and compensation tied to individual and team performance 
we also completed work on and began implementation of our diversity strategy  tied to our workforce  distributors  suppliers and customer base 
overall results our vision is to be one of the top performing property and casualty companies in the industry 
we measure our success by tracking our performance against the following three long term financial goals earnings per share average annual growth of percent return on equity performance that ranks us among the best in our industry revenue growth growth at or above the average of our peers  as long as it s at acceptable profit margins 
table of contents the following tables show the trends in these three key measures of our performance net income per diluted share net return on equity revenues segment results how we report our results we manage our businesses in four business and seven reportable segments safeco personal insurance spi auto property specialty safeco business insurance sbi sbi regular sbi special accounts facility surety p c other on january   we made minor revisions to our p c segments to better reflect how these segments are currently managed 
our non voluntary auto and property results  previously in p c other  are now included in spi auto and spi property 
certain products previously reported in specialty  primarily earthquake  inland marine and dwelling fire  are now included in property 
our commercial specialty programs and large commercial accounts in runoff  previously sbi runoff  are now included in p c other 
prior years have been restated to reflect this revised presentation 
in addition to these segments  certain activities such as interest expense  debt repurchases and intercompany eliminations are reported in corporate and are not allocated to individual segments 
along with the sale of our l i businesses  all results related to l i are included in discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
how we measure our profitability we use three measures of our underwriting results to assess the profitability of our business segments 
these measures are underwriting profit or loss  combined ratio and net earned premiums 
underwriting profit or loss is our net earned premiums less our losses from claims  loss adjustment expenses lae and underwriting expenses 

table of contents combined ratio is our losses  lae and underwriting expenses divided by our net earned premiums 
we report combined ratio as a percentage 
for example  a combined ratio of means that for every dollar of premium received  cents is spent on losses  lae and underwriting expenses and cents is underwriting profit 
a lower combined ratio reflects better underwriting results than a higher combined ratio 
we include insurance premiums in revenue as they are earned over the terms of the respective policies 
more information about our segment results can be found on page although investment activities are an important part of our business and comprise a significant part of our total revenues  we don t include our investment portfolio results when measuring the profitability of our individual segments 
that s because we manage the investment portfolio separately from our underwriting activities 
we invest the insurance premiums we receive in a diversified portfolio until they re needed to pay claims 
our first priority is to protect our policyholders  so we invest in a diversified portfolio composed primarily of government securities and high grade fixed maturities 
this strategy generally provides protection for our policyholders and a steady income for our shareholders 
our investment philosophy is to emphasize investment yield  balanced with investment quality and risk provide for liquidity when needed diversify our portfolio we measure our investment results in two parts by the net investment income we earn on our invested assets  and the net realized investment gains or losses we recognize when we sell or impair investments 
more information about our investment results can be found on page application of critical accounting estimates we have identified the accounting estimates listed below as critical to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 
the application of these accounting estimates requires our management to use judgments involving assumptions and estimates about future results  trends or other developments that could significantly influence our results if actual experience differs from those assumptions and estimates 
we review these judgments frequently 
an understanding of them may help readers to better understand our consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis md a 
we consider our most critical accounting estimates to be loss and loss adjustment expense reserves reinsurance valuation of investments loss and loss adjustment expense reserves our loss and loss adjustment expense lae reserves reflect management s estimates of the ultimate amounts for losses from claims and related settlement expenses that we have not yet paid to settle both reported and unreported claims 
we report these amounts in our loss and lae reserves on our consolidated balance sheets 
we record two categories of loss and lae reserves case basis reserves and incurred but not reported ibnr reserves 

table of contents we estimate case basis reserves as the amount we will have to pay for losses that have already been reported to us but are not yet fully paid 
these amounts include related legal expenses and other costs associated with resolving and settling a particular claim 
in addition  at the end of every reporting period  we establish ibnr reserves to estimate the amount we will have to pay for losses that have occurred  but have not yet been reported to us losses that have been reported to us that may ultimately be paid out differently than expected by our case basis reserves losses that have been paid and closed but may reopen and require future payment expenses related to resolving and settling these losses we use actuarial methods combined with management judgment to estimate ibnr reserves 
process and methodology for establishing loss and lae reserves the process for establishing loss and lae reserves differs for case basis versus ibnr reserves 
case basis reserves for reported losses  we establish a reserve estimate for each claim based on the known facts regarding the claim and the parameters of the coverage that our policy provides 
case basis reserves are adjusted as additional facts become available to us 
case basis reserves are reduced as we make payments for our reported claims 
ibnr reserves to establish our ibnr reserves  we use different approaches for current accident year losses prior accident years losses allocated loss adjustment expense alae unallocated loss adjustment expense ulae these approaches exclude exceptional loss activity associated with catastrophic weather losses  non catastrophe weather losses and other large loss or salvage the amount we recover from property that becomes ours after we pay for a total loss and subrogation our right to recover payments from third parties activity 
the methodologies used to establish ibnr reserves differ for the current accident year the year in which a claim occurs versus the prior accident years 
the methodologies also differ for long tailed lines of business versus short tail lines of business 
generally speaking  short tailed lines of business are those lines where the vast majority of claims from a particular accident year are both reported and settled within two years 
current accident year losses for long tailed lines of business  an annual expected loss ratio approach is used 
under this approach  an expected loss ratio is applied to current period earned premiums resulting in an estimate of ultimate losses 
the resulting estimate of ultimate losses is reduced by the current period paid and case basis reserve activity resulting in the current period ibnr 
for short tailed lines of business  a ratio of ibnr to earned premiums is used 
under this approach  an ibnr percentage is applied to current period earned premiums resulting in current period ibnr 
expected loss ratios and ibnr to earned premiums percentages are developed based on analysis of prior accident years supplemented with data about changes in our book of business  changes in the external environment in which we operate  changes in our pricing and underwriting and changes in our claims handling practices 
we review these ratios throughout the year  and we revise the expected loss ratio periodically based on these analyses 
changes in the selection of the expected loss ratio result in a change in the loss reserve estimate for the current year  which we record in current period earnings 

table of contents prior accident years losses for long tailed lines of business  the beginning ibnr for prior accident years is adjusted for paid and case basis reserve activity in the current period 
this yields ending ibnr  absent an explicit determination to adjust ibnr beyond this activity 
for short tailed lines of business  the beginning ibnr for prior accident years is adjusted for expected emerged losses to calculate ibnr  absent an explicit determination to adjust ibnr beyond this activity 
allocated loss adjustment expense alae alae reserves represent an estimate of the claims settlement expenses that can be identified to a specific claim 
alae reserve estimates are generally established as a function of losses 
for some small lines  estimates of ultimate alae are established as a percentage of earned premiums 
these alae factors are established based on historical ratios supplemented for changes in the internal and external environments 
alae ibnr is determined by subtracting paid and case basis activity from the ultimate alae estimate 
unallocated loss adjustment expense ulae ulae reserves are booked in aggregate for current and prior accident years combined 
in general  prior reserves are carried forward and supplemented with either a percentage of earned premiums or with a fixed dollar amount of additional reserves to account for growth in the line of business 
estimating loss and lae reserves estimating loss and lae reserves is a complex process because the ultimate losses are uncertain 
some claims will be paid out over a number of years  and there may be a significant lag between the time a loss that is insured by us occurs and the time it is reported to us 
we make significant judgments and assumptions about many internal variables and external factors 
examples of internal variables include changes in our claims handling practices changes in our business mix examples of external factors include trends in loss costs economic inflation judicial changes legislative changes regulatory changes in addition  certain claims may be paid out over a number of years  and there may be a significant lag between the time a loss that is insured by us occurs and the time it is reported to us 
these variables and factors affect in a variety of ways the amounts we have to pay for losses and related expenses 
as a result  it is not always possible to quantify their ultimate impact on our future payments 
our process for arriving at our best estimate of ultimate loss and lae involves both management and actuaries 
it involves reviewing actuarial assumptions  holding discussions with claims and underwriting management  and considering changes in the internal and external environment 
because estimating reserves requires us to use assumptions and judgment  our actual future losses will differ from our estimates 

table of contents some actuarial techniques rely on our past loss and lae experience to estimate our future payments 
the changes we ve made in our business in recent years  however  will affect our future payments 
for instance  we have introduced new products  tightened our underwriting criteria and improved our claims handling practices 
as a result  we also consider these changes when estimating future payments 
for most of our lines of business  we use multiple estimation methods that vary depending on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim liabilities being evaluated to establish our estimate of ultimate losses 
our estimate of ibnr is the difference between our projection of ultimate losses and the payments and case basis reserves for those losses 
our analyses are applied to historical claim activity and experience  supplemented with data about changes in our book of business  changes in the external environment in which we operate  changes in our pricing and underwriting  and changes in our claims handling practices 
the standard actuarial methods we use include paid loss development historical payment patterns for prior claims are used to estimate future payment patterns for current claims 
these patterns are applied to current payments by accident year to yield expected ultimate losses 
incurred loss development historical case incurred patterns paid losses plus case basis reserves for prior claims are used to estimate future case incurred patterns for current claims 
these patterns are applied to current case incurred by accident year to yield expected ultimate losses 
average claim value and claim count development loss payment and or case incurred amounts are divided by the number of claims to generate average costs per claim 
using historical patterns  the expected ultimate average cost per claim by accident year is projected 
separately  the expected ultimate number of claims is projected by accident year 
the product of the expected ultimate average cost per claim and the expected ultimate number of claims yields expected ultimate losses 
expected loss ratio loss ratios are developed for recent accident years based on historical accident year loss ratios adjusted to the current economic conditions and current rate levels 
the expected loss ratio for each accident year is then applied to the actual earned premiums to calculate expected ultimate losses 
bornhuetter ferguson blends the expected loss ratio method with either the paid or incurred loss development method 
both methods are used with weights applied to each of them based on the maturity of the accident year 
as an example  if the current accident year for personal automobile bodily injury is estimated to be paid  then the paid loss development method would receive a weight of  and the expected loss ratio method would receive weight 
our actuaries use many of the above methods to estimate reserves for each product line 
the merits of each method are evaluated given the facts at hand 
an estimate of the ultimate losses is then made based upon the particular method or combination of methods that is deemed most appropriate 
for example  if a particular line has been subject to significant changes in claims handling practices that would impact the comparability of case basis reserves between periods  the actuary would give little or no credibility to the incurred loss development approach 
the various assumptions  estimates and other factors that may have an impact on our ultimate losses are discussed with management to determine the company s best estimate of the ultimate losses and lae  and our estimate of ibnr is then recorded 
we use range analyses only to back test whether previously established estimates for reserves for our lines of business are reasonable  using subsequent information 
we do not develop a range and then select a number from the range as our reserve estimate 
furthermore  the methods used and resulting end points of the ranges change over time as conditions affecting reserves change 

table of contents changing management s estimate management s estimate of the ultimate loss and lae reserves is subject to change as additional data emerge 
this could occur as a result of the emergence of exceptional loss activity an actuarial study the emergence of internal variables or external factors that would alter management s view we review our reserves quarterly 
this review includes either an actuarial analysis involving the application of standard actuarial techniques or the review of the paid and incurred activity in the quarter relative to the assumptions from previous actuarial analyses 
in addition  special studies are undertaken periodically for certain lines of business or exposures 
using this information  considering assumptions  methods and internal variables or external factors results in management s point of view 
catastrophe and non catastrophe weather losses are established by event by the claims department when the event occurs 
these estimates are revised as the actual loss experience develops as the claims are reported and settled over time 
we may determine that certain loss or salvage subrogation activity is beyond the scope of what was anticipated in the initial establishment of loss reserves 
in this case  an explicit adjustment would be made to ibnr to reflect this activity directly as a change in ibnr 
internal variables such as changes in claims handling practices and changes in our business mix  and external factors such as trends in loss costs  economic inflation or judicial or legislative changes are considered in determining an estimate 
estimating our loss and lae reserves is an ongoing process 
our loss and lae reserves represent management s best estimate of the ultimate future payments associated with losses and related expenses 
we record any adjustments to these reserves in the periods in which we change the estimates 
we report changes to these reserves in our results of operations 
other considerations we reduce our reserves by the amounts we expect to recover from salvage and subrogation 
we accrue salvage and subrogation recoveries on an individual case basis for large claims 
we use actuarial techniques to estimate the amount for small claims 
we do not discount any of our reserves to present value 
we purchase reinsurance to limit our exposure to potential large losses 
we report the amounts we expect to recover from reinsurers as reinsurance recoverable assets on our consolidated balance sheets

for the lines of business that we write  variability in the frequency the average number of claims filed or severity the average cost of a claim is generally a function of one or more of the following factors payout period lines of business involving claims that stay open for long periods of time are subject to greater reserve variability 
this is driven by the difficulty in estimating future economic  social and legal environments that will impact both the time that such claims remain open and their future costs 
size of the reserve balance slight variations in large reserve balances can generate significant financial volatility 
policy limits lines of business involving policies with high or unlimited policy limits are subject to greater variation 
policy deductibles lines of business involving policies with large deductibles or policies that provide coverage for claims that exceed the policy limit of an underlying policy excess policies are subject to greater variability 
the existence of large policy deductibles considerably increases the lag between the occurrence of a claim and the time it is reported to the insurance carrier 
safeco personal insurance spi spi loss and lae reserves are estimated using standard actuarial methods combined with management judgment 
these methods involve analyzing past claims experience for recent changes in business claim practices and the internal and external environments 
emphasis is placed on evaluating claims reporting and closing patterns as well as the size of loss payments and case basis reserves 
spi losses and related expenses are analyzed by line of business  product  coverage and geographic area 

table of contents auto policies provide coverage for bodily injury  uninsured motorists  personal injury protection  medical payments  property damage  and comprehensive and collision losses 
bodily injury bi coverage represents the largest portion of our loss and alae reserves held for auto 
as of year end  our bi loss and alae reserves were small variations from our assumptions can yield significant financial volatility given the magnitude of the reserve balances 
in arriving at our estimates we consider our changing mix of business as our business grows  we write more policies in markets where we have not written significant business previously 
we continue to write a higher proportion of standard and non standard risks than we have historically 
these risks have  on average  higher frequencies and lower severities than preferred risks 
our increase in new business  which generally has higher claim frequencies than business already on the books for longer than one year general inflation and medical cost trends to illustrate the sensitivity of our estimate  a one point increase in our severity change assumption for auto bi would yield an approximate increase in the estimated reserve 
our property and specialty lines are predominantly short tailed business  and most claims are reported and settled within months 
we use standard actuarial techniques combined with management judgment to estimate reserves for those lines 
safeco business insurance sbi and p c other sbi primarily writes commercial multi peril  property  workers compensation  automobile and general liability insurance for small to medium sized businesses 
p c other is composed of large commercial business and other businesses we have placed in runoff 
as many of the commercial products and exposures are similar  we estimate reserves for these two segments in a combined fashion by product line 
our sbi and p c other segments have exposure to asbestos and environmental losses primarily from policies we no longer write 
these segments also have exposure to construction defects losses and related expenses through the general liability  commercial multi peril and umbrella coverages they provide 
these exposures and the risks they present are discussed together as they are estimated by product and like exposure

table of contents claim count history has been restated to reflect refinements in to our methods for counting claims 
factors in estimating loss reserves for workers compensation estimating reserves for workers compensation involves a significant degree of uncertainty and judgment 
this is driven by long payout periods workers compensation claims can remain open years or more  introducing variability in the ultimate length of the payout 
the cumulative effect of inflation trends over time  particularly medical cost inflation  can be significant 
the unlimited liability nature of workers compensation policies 
changes in future benefit levels legislative actions and judicial interpretations can affect the cost of future benefits 
changes in life expectancy changes in life expectancy increase both the length of future payments and the cost of treatment 
claim reporting lags some claims are not made immediately  as a result  we remain exposed to workers compensation losses arising from policies written years ago 
changes in our business  including claims handling practices  changes in our writings of large versus small to medium sized accounts  and changes in state mix 

table of contents in determining management s best estimate for workers compensation reserves  long term medical cost inflation trends over the average claim payout period represent our most significant assumption 
we have assumed that double digit medical cost inflation will continue in the near term  moderating over time to historical levels  resulting in a average medical severity trend over the life of the reserves 
our best estimate of workers compensation reserves presents risk of unfavorable reserve development should medical inflation trends not abate 
a one point increase in our estimate of the average medical severity trend would yield an approximate increase in our estimated reserve 
other commercial products excluding commercial liability products  which are discussed below  the payout periods for our other commercial products  primarily commercial auto and commercial property  are relatively short 
as a result  our estimated loss reserves for these products are subject to less volatility than our workers compensation reserves 
we use standard actuarial techniques combined with management judgment to estimate these loss reserves 
commercial liability products our commercial multi peril policies  business owners policies  general liability and commercial umbrella policies provide third party liability coverage to our policyholders 
estimating reserves for third party liability involves a significant degree of uncertainty and judgment 
this is driven by long payout periods many third party liability claims are paid many years after the occurrence of the loss 
as a result  the cumulative effect of inflation can be significant 
claim reporting lags some claims are not made immediately  as a result  we remain exposed to losses arising from policies written years ago 
changes in coverage interpretation legislative and judicial interpretations can affect the cost of future payments 
changes in our business  including claims handling practices  changes in our writings of large versus small to medium sized accounts  and changes in state mix 
these facts give rise to latent claim emergence and evolving coverage precedents for such claims as asbestos  environmental  construction defects and sexual misconduct allegations for religious institutions 
asbestos this table shows our loss and alae reserves for asbestos related claims 
the table excludes ulae reserves  which at year end were december losses and alae payments  before reinsurance loss and alae payments  net of reinsurance reserves at end of year  before reinsurance reserves at end of year  net of reinsurance three year survival ratio  gross three year survival ratio  net claims and average costs open claims at end of year average paid per closed claim average case reserve per open claim number of claims and whole dollars  net of reinsurance 
claim count history has been restated to reflect refinements in to our methods for counting claims 

table of contents in this table  the three year survival ratio represents the number of years that our current loss reserves would last if future payments are made at the same average annual rate experienced over the last three years 
the three year survival ratio is equal to our loss reserves  divided by our average annual payment over the last three years 
due to volatility and sparseness of data  estimating loss reserves for asbestos claims requires more than standard actuarial techniques 
as a result  we analyze and consider claims statistics and trends  directional trends in survival ratios  and applicable law and coverage litigation 
our asbestos liability exposure here s the breakout of our asbestos loss reserves  net of reinsurance relates to runoff assumed reinsurance operations and our exposure to syndicates and pools 
relates to our direct exposure 
accordingly  we ve established two separate special claims handling functions  one that specializes in asbestos claims related to our runoff assumed reinsurance operations and one that specializes in asbestos claims related to our direct exposure 
our exposure through our runoff assumed reinsurance operations is primarily excess of loss reinsurance 
pools are groups of insurers that enter into agreements to share exposure related to specific insureds 
our loss reserve estimates for pools reflect the loss reserve estimates provided by the pools independent actuaries 
the loss experience of our runoff assumed reinsurance operations follows the general industry trend 
our direct exposure is primarily due to smaller and more peripheral entities becoming defendants in asbestos claims 
our exposure to the major high profile asbestos defendants is limited for our direct business 
this results from our historical business strategy to not write direct coverages for larger companies 
in addition  we do not have direct exposure to businesses that are the subject of settlement agreements 
at december   our ibnr was of our loss reserves for asbestos claims 
we categorize our policyholders with active asbestos claims in two groups according to their exposure  consisting of large asbestos accounts our policyholders with cumulative loss payments exceeding  as of december  small asbestos accounts our policyholders with cumulative loss payments of less than  as of december  this table provides details about our policyholders and losses paid related to asbestos loss reserves number of policyholders net paid net asbestos reserves of asbestos reserves assumed reinsurance and pools policyholders with active claims large asbestos accounts small asbestos accounts total ibnr total 
table of contents estimating loss reserves for asbestos estimating loss reserves for asbestos claims requires more judgment than our other lines of business 
that s primarily because past claim experience may not be representative of future claims 
several factors make it difficult to predict future asbestos claim payments 
they include insufficient data inherent risk of major litigation diverging legal interpretations regulatory actions legislative actions increases in bankruptcy proceedings non impaired claimants being allowed to make claims efforts by insureds to seek coverage interpretation not subject to aggregate limits changes in these factors could result in future asbestos claims payments that are significantly different from those currently predicted 
in estimating our loss reserves for asbestos claims  we consider applicable law and coverage litigation perform actuarial analysis review industry information to test the reasonableness of our reserves do not consider ongoing congressional reform efforts some asbestos related claims are subject to non product liability coverage rather than product liability coverage 
non product liability coverage may not be subject to policy aggregate limits

claim count history has been restated to reflect refinements in to our methods for counting claims 
in  we refined the classification of our environmental reserves to include only claims involving gradual discharge or leakage of pollutants or contaminants into the environment 
these claims generally involve multiple policy periods  and the exact date of the occurrence is generally not determinable 
in general  these claims involve underground storage tanks  official united states epa sites superfund  clean water act allegations  and other exposures prior to the insurance services office iso pollution exclusion 
the data in the table above has been restated to reflect this definition 

table of contents our environmental claims exposure our environmental claims result from our runoff assumed reinsurance operations and our commercial general liability line that we write on a direct basis 
we generally have avoided writing coverages for large companies with substantial exposures to environmental claims 
as a result  our average environmental claim tends to be small 
at year end  our ibnr was of our loss reserves for environmental claims 
in  we reached a settlement on a large number of environmental claims related to coverage on general liability policies written for individual gasoline stations 
under these policies  there was a petrochemical company named as an additional insured 
we have settled all claims with the additional insured 
this global settlement and future indemnification agreement is included in our payment activity 
we have no other reported claims of this nature 
other payments in reflect year to year volatility in claim and payment activity 
in  our loss payments returned to levels more in line with our historical experience 
estimating loss reserves for environmental claims the volatility of actuarial estimates of liabilities for environmental claims is often greater than that of other exposures 
that s due to several factors including insufficient data changes in the number and types of defendants involved with these claims unresolved legal issues  including existence of coverage  definition of ultimate damages and final allocation of damages due from the financially responsible parties due to the volatility and sparseness of data  we estimate loss reserves for environmental claims by combining standard actuarial techniques with our analysis of claim statistics and trends directional trends in survival ratios applicable law and coverage litigation construction defects this table shows our loss and alae reserves for construction defects claims

claim count history has been restated to reflect refinements to our methods for counting claims 

table of contents our construction defects claims exposure our exposure to construction defects claims comes from general liability and commercial multi peril coverages we provide to contractors 
construction defects claims result from alleged defective work performed in the construction of large structures that include apartments  condominiums and large developments of single family dwellings or other housing 
construction defects claims often seek payment for damages resulting directly from the alleged defective construction work and diminished economic value of the structure meaning that the structure has less market value because of the alleged defective construction work 
construction defects claims are complex  with an inherent difficulty in determining fault 
most of our claims are concentrated in a small number of states  including california 
at december   our ibnr was of our loss reserves for construction defects claims 
we have taken a number of actions to mitigate our exposure to construction defects claims  enabling us to vigorously defend our coverage position 
they include stricter underwriting standards a separate claims handling function and internal legal counsel specializing in construction defects claims relationships with external legal counsel specializing in construction defects claims estimating loss reserves for construction defects claims the main factors in estimating loss reserves for construction defects claims are changing legal and regulatory environments statutes of limitations and statutes of repose in filing these claims diminished value claims involvement of multiple plaintiffs  defendants and insurers long periods of time between the actual construction work and the date the claim is reported the uncertainty created by these factors requires more judgment in estimating loss reserves for construction defects claims than for our other lines of business 
we use techniques developed specifically for estimating loss reserves for construction defects claims 
with these techniques  we estimate the number of future claims and the average value of every claim and make adjustments for anticipated changes in coverage interpretations  regulations  judicial rulings  plaintiff attorney involvement and changes in our book of business 
over the last three years  our number of open construction defects claims has decreased steadily an average drop of per year 
our loss reserve estimates assume that the number of open claims will continue to decrease  but at a slower rate 
surety our surety bonds insure construction performance  as well as legal matters that include appeals  probates and bankruptcies 
by their nature  surety claims result in lower loss frequency and higher loss severity than most of our p c businesses 
in addition  surety claims provide us with substantial opportunity for subrogation and salvage  the nature and extent of which vary from case to case 
to estimate loss reserves for surety  we examine actuarial analysis large claim analysis reinsurance terms and conditions 
table of contents individual insured exposure analysis analysis of subrogation and salvage potential as of december   our surety loss and alae reserves net of salvage and subrogation recoveries were as of december   our expected salvage and subrogation recoveries exceeded our surety loss and alae reserves by surety reserves fluctuate from period to period due to the lag between the time payments are made on a claim and the time we receive salvage and subrogation amounts

this includes an reduction in world trade center loss estimates  a increase in asbestos reserves and a increase in environmental reserves 
in a number of lines at various times during the year due to emerging claim trends and related loss data  including ulae 

table of contents in  we increased our estimates for prior years loss and lae reserves by the total increase included during the third quarter as a result of higher medical cost trends for workers compensation than previously expected

this increase included in p c other  in sbi regular and in sbi special accounts facility 
the largest amount of reserve development related to california  particularly the large commercial business we began exiting in we also increased ulae reserves by this increase included in p c other  in sbi regular and in sbi special accounts facility 
this increase reflected our estimate of the ongoing expense of servicing workers compensation claims 
as claims remain open for longer periods  our costs to handle these claims rise 
in  we increased our estimates for prior years loss and lae reserves by we made increases throughout the year as part of our quarterly evaluations  based on emerging claim trends and related loss data 
the increase of included for construction defects claims  reflecting legal costs that were higher than estimated 
efforts to mitigate the severity levels of construction defects losses led to higher legal costs 
for workers compensation losses  reflecting medical cost inflation at a rate that was higher than anticipated for asbestos claims  reflecting losses related to our participation in pools and syndicates that were higher than estimated for other loss reserves and ulae reserves due primarily to higher than anticipated losses for our london operations that were placed in runoff 
the losses were due to some high layer excess coverages and the long reporting lag of these operations

table of contents section b shows the cumulative amount we have actually paid through the years 
for example as shown in section a  our loss and lae reserves net of reinsurance at year end were  after years  we ve actually paid  section c shows our revised loss and lae reserve estimates through the years 
for example as shown in section a  our reserves net of reinsurance at year end were  section c shows the annual reestimation of those reserves  and after years our revised reserves were  section d shows the cumulative redundancy or deficiency developed through the years 
a redundancy occurs when our reserves exceed our actual loss experience  and a deficiency occurs when our reserves are less than our actual experience 
for example as shown in section a  our loss and lae reserves net of reinsurance at year end were  after one year those reserves developed a redundancy  and after years the redundancy grew to this is the difference between the reserves shown in section a net of reinsurance  and the reestimated amounts in section c 
our analysis of losses and lae reserve development table shows these trends favorable development in reserve estimates from through unfavorable development in reserve estimates from through favorable development in reserve estimates in the favorable trend from through was due to loss and lae reserves that were ultimately conservative benefits from establishing specialized claims units for construction defects  asbestos and environmental exposures and fraud investigations favorable workers compensation legislation in the early s moderation in medical costs and inflation in that period the unfavorable trend from through was due to significant increases in workers compensation medical costs legislative and regulatory developments higher than expected number of construction defects  asbestos and environmental losses the favorable development in was due to lower than expected number of claims in auto and property lower than expected number of claims in commercial auto  primarily related to ohio auto lower than anticipated losses related to the world trade center in the analysis of losses and lae reserve development table  all amounts include the effects of changes in amounts for prior periods 
conditions and trends that affected our loss and lae reserves in the past may not occur in the future 
for example  substantial reduction in our large commercial insurance and program business in will distort trends in these tables

table of contents reinsurance on page  we provided an overview of how we use reinsurance 
here  we focus on how we estimate reinsurance recoverables 
the reinsurance we buy limits our losses on certain individual risks or reduces our exposure to catastrophic events 
we buy reinsurance from several reinsurers and are not dependent upon any single reinsurer 
reinsurance recoverables are the amounts our reinsurers owe us related to the losses we have incurred 
we reported at december   and at december   in reinsurance recoverables as assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
determining reinsurance recoverables requires us to make estimates because we do not know the exact amount due from the reinsurer until all our underlying losses are settled 
the amount of reinsurance recoverables varies depending on the size of individual losses and the aggregate amount of losses in particular lines of business 
to estimate reinsurance recoverables  we review estimates of large losses that are covered under reinsurance agreements review reinsurance recoverable amounts for specific claims as well as for lines of business compare our estimates with past reinsurance recoverables perform actuarial analyses of loss development above and below our retention levels the amounts we absorb before the reinsurers reimburse us specified under the reinsurance agreements examine actuarial data with and without reinsurance recoverables estimating an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables we regularly review our reinsurance recoverables to determine the collectibility of what is owed to us 
in doing that  we review historical collection experience reinsurance recoverables associated with individual reinsurers  including large exposures and those with lower rated reinsurers reinsurance recoverables concentrated with a particular event or issue for example  a large loss  a catastrophe or an emerging claim issue trends in default rates by credit rating our estimated allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was at december   and at december  valuation of investments our investments include fixed maturities and marketable equity securities  which we report at fair value as available for sale securities on our consolidated balance sheets 
the fixed maturities we invest in include bonds  mortgage backed securities and redeemable preferred stock 
the marketable equity securities we invest in include common stock and non redeemable preferred stock 

table of contents how we determine other than temporary declines in the value of our investments we regularly review the fair value of our investments 
if the fair value of any of our investments falls below our cost basis in the investment  we analyze the decrease to determine whether it is an other than temporary decline in value 
to make this determination for each security  we consider how long and by how much the fair value of the security has been below its cost the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer of the security  including any specific events that may affect its operations or earnings potential our intent and ability to keep the security long enough for it to recover its value any downgrades of the security by a rating agency any reduction or elimination of dividends or non payment of scheduled interest payments based on our analysis  we make a judgment as to whether the decline is other than temporary 
sometimes  an investment decline that we consider temporary in one quarter can become other than temporary in a future quarter 
if the decline is other than temporary  we report an impairment charge within net realized investment gains and losses in our consolidated statements of income in the period we make that determination 
determining the fair value of our investments in most cases  we use public market price information to determine the fair value of our investments when such information is available 
when third party market information is not available  as is the case for securities that are not publicly traded  we use other valuation techniques 
such techniques include using independent pricing sources evaluating discounted cash flows identifying comparable securities with quoted market prices based on industry sector  credit quality and maturity using internally prepared valuations based on certain modeling and pricing methods we used these other valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of in fixed maturities and in marketable equity securities on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  these amounts represented of our total investment portfolio

starting in  we introduced segmented underwriting models in auto  property and sbi regular  which provide more precise matching of rates to risk characteristics 
this has enabled us to expand the business we write and we are able to provide price quotes for of the insurance applications in our distributors offices

our auto product is available on safeco now in all of the states where we write business 
in  we enhanced safeco now to streamline the service process for auto customers and distributors  allowing online processing of auto policy changes and endorsements  such as vehicle additions and deletions  vehicle replacements or updates  and coverage and deductible changes 
offering a segmented auto insurance product our segmented auto insurance product  which was rolled out in phases throughout and  offers up to underwriting tiers 
these underwriting tiers are determined using multi variant models to assess the risk of loss based on many factors  and they provide a more accurate price for a wider range of risks 
we re better able to assign the right price to the 
table of contents corresponding level of risk  producing greater precision and greater profitability 
also  this tiered approach has expanded the risks we can underwrite and price  so we have an auto product available for approximately of all applications quoted by our distributors 
our segmented auto insurance product is available in of the states where we sell auto insurance 
we continue to work with the california department of insurance to explore potential options to implement our tiered pricing methodology 
improving the claims management process changes in claims handling processes also contributed to our improved performance 
we ve made investments in training for our claims professionals  and we now have more efficient processes and better metrics to measure key performance drivers such as policyholder retention  customer satisfaction and quality and cost of service 
our claims processing combines the efficiency of centralized claims handling and customer service centers and the flexibility of field representatives 
using our paperless claims environment  our field representatives are not restricted to a specific office or physical location 
this flexibility adds significant savings and efficiencies to the claims handling process and increases the quality of our customer service 
expense management in and  we took actions to reduce our expenses through corporate restructuring  which reduced corporate department expenses allocated to auto 
we also continued to reduce costs through the refinement of our automated underwriting models 
net earned premiums net earned premiums increased or in compared with  and or in compared with the increases in net earned premiums were driven by growth of policies in force pif pif grew in and in this reflected stable retention of policies in  in and in and strong new business growth 
new policies sold increased in compared with  and in compared with pif growth contributed approximately to the increase in net earned premiums in compared with  and approximately in compared with this growth was driven by the introduction of our safeco now web based platform early in and our segmented underwriting model in increases in filed rates we file rate changes on a state by state basis 
overall  we received approval for average rate increases of in and in rate changes are reflected on existing policies at renewal  resulting in an increase to net earned premiums of approximately compared with  and in compared with premium trend premiums also are impacted by the increases in those policies that insure newer and more expensive cars  or premium trend

in  we achieved our first underwriting profit since our underwriting results were affected by rate increases our rate increases improved our combined ratio by points in compared with  and points in compared with loss costs in  growth in our average premium more than offset the increase in loss costs 
we experienced mid single digit increases in severity the average cost of a claim in part due to the impact of medical inflation on bodily injury claims 
the increases in severity were slightly 
table of contents offset by a low single digit decrease in frequency the average number of claims filed 
the impact of loss cost changes net of premium trend change increased our combined ratio by approximately points 
in  our premium trend was higher than our loss cost change  which was slightly negative as a result of severity increases in the low single digits offset by a slightly larger decrease in frequency 
this improved our combined ratio by points in compared with prior year reserve development results in included favorable reserve development of related to prior accident years primarily from lower claim frequencies than originally estimated 
results in and included unfavorable reserve development of and related to prior accident years

in  this was partly offset by higher bonus commission and employee performance bonus expenses due to our growth and improved underwriting results 
where we re headed we anticipate the following factors will impact growth and profitability in the near future rates in auto  we are experiencing a more competitive marketplace as competitors increase advertising and sales incentives 
we also have seen modest and selective rate decreases by competitors in some states 
we remain committed to disciplined pricing using our segmented product 
actual rate changes obtained may vary  based on the rate needed in a given state combined with regulatory review and approval  as well as developments in loss cost trends 
we anticipate that rate increases combined with premium trend will at least keep pace with loss cost growth 
business growth as our business grows  we will write more policies in markets where we previously have not written significant business 
we expect to write more standard and non standard risks  which have  on average  higher frequencies than preferred risks 
however  preferred auto business will still remain our largest book of business and continue to be our greatest area of opportunity 
we are continuing to expand into eastern states where we have less geographic presence currently 
competitive environment the auto insurance marketplace has become more competitive in recent months as more writers are experiencing strong underwriting results 
while we expect this competition will slow our growth rate somewhat  we anticipate premium growth in the high single digits 
this growth will be driven by more distributor appointments  continuing to expand geographical coverage  ongoing refinement in our underwriting segmentation and our commitment to ease of doing business for our distributors 
continued commitment to ease of doing business we will continue to deliver additional web based policy change transactions capabilities in phases throughout during the first quarter of  we will launch an updated automated underwriting model for our auto product 
this will enhance our underwriting further  more closely matching rate for risk in our auto markets 
we also are making billing system enhancements  enabling our distributors and customers to view on line billing information and auto changes 

table of contents compensation we have redesigned our spi agent compensation plans for this allows distributors to select an spi compensation structure best suited to their business model whether their primary opportunity is new business growth  retention of existing customers  cross selling or overall profitability 
overall in  we anticipate our auto revenue will grow at greater than industry rates  while achieving our target combined ratio of property year ended december net earned premiums underwriting profit loss loss and lae ratio expense ratio combined ratio the property segment provides homeowners  dwelling fire  earthquake and inland marine coverage for individuals 
our property coverages protect homes  condominiums and rental property contents against losses from a wide variety of hazards 
driving our results we re achieving improved profitability in our property business through these strategic initiatives  which we ve been emphasizing since offering a segmented homeowners insurance product reunderwriting our homeowners business in selected states tightening policy terms improving the claims management process offering a segmented homeowners insurance product our segmented homeowners product  which was rolled out in phases from to  generally offers nine underwriting tiers 
these underwriting tiers are determined using multi variate models to assess the risk of loss based on many factors and provide a more accurate price for a wider range of risks 
this increased segmentation means we are better able to align rate with risk  producing greater precision and greater profitability 
it also means we can grow by offering coverage to more home owners 
we sell our new product in of the states in which we are licensed to sell homeowners insurance 
we continue to work with the california department of insurance to explore potential options to implement our tiered pricing methodology 
reunderwriting our homeowners business in selected states during  we reviewed and updated our policyholder information in several states to verify we had accurate information concerning their property 
this helped us ensure we were charging the appropriate premium for the risk involved 
tightening policy terms in  in of the states in which we are licensed to sell homeowners insurance  we placed a cap on the maximum amount payable in a total loss of of the home s insured value 
in some cases  we have taken steps to restrict coverage  primarily on mold damages 
these restrictions generally cap mold damages at thousand  including remediation costs 

table of contents improving the claims management process changes in claims handling processes also contributed to our improved performance 
we ve made investments in training for our claims professionals  and we now have more efficient processes and better metrics to measure key performance drivers such as policyholder retention  customer satisfaction and quality and cost of service 
our claims processing combines the efficiency of centralized claims handling and customer service centers and the flexibility of field representatives 
using our paperless claims environment  our field representatives are not restricted to a specific office or physical location 
this flexibility adds significant savings and efficiencies to the claims handling process and increases customer service 
we established a national catastrophe team in that immediately mobilizes when a disaster strikes to assess the damage  write checks to cover temporary living expenses and emergency repairs  and provide comfort and support to customers 
in most cases  we issue payments to customers on the spot following a disaster 
net earned premiums net earned premiums were flat in compared with  and increased less than in compared with this reflects decline in pif our retention rates stabilized in at compared with in and in however  the number of policies that did not renew with us in and exceeded the number of new policies written in each year 
this led to a net reduction in pif of  or approximately in net earned premiums in compared with  and  or approximately in net earned premiums in compared with increases in filed rates we file rate changes on a state by state basis

as expected  this has contributed to an increase in new business 
our new business increased by in over  as our nine tier homeowners product became available in of the states where we write business 
new business decreased by in compared with due to moratoriums in certain unprofitable states 
we lifted these moratoriums throughout and into  and currently have no statewide moratoriums 
underwriting results and combined ratio our underwriting results in property improved and our combined ratio improved points in compared with our underwriting results improved and our combined ratio improved points in compared with the improvements in underwriting results and combined ratios were primarily driven by rate increases our homeowners rate increases improved our combined ratio by points in compared with  and points in compared with loss costs the trend over the past two years toward higher deductibles with most home owners increasing their deductibles from to as well as other policy changes that have tightened contract terms has significantly reduced the number of maintenance type claims 
in  we have experienced reductions in frequency of claims in the mid teens  offset by a mid teen increase in severity  decreasing our combined ratio by approximately points compared with we experienced a frequency decrease in the high range in compared with  which was offset slightly by a mid single digit increase in severity 
this improved our combined ratio by approximately points in compared with 
table of contents prior year reserve development our underwriting results in included favorable reserve development of related to prior accident years  primarily driven by changes in contract terms resulting in decreased frequency of claims beyond that previously expected 
results in included unfavorable reserve development of relating to prior accident years 
the favorable reserve development in improved the combined ratio by points compared with  while the increase in unfavorable reserve development in increased the combined ratio points compared with catastrophe losses we categorize catastrophes as events resulting in losses greater than  per state and involving multiple claims and policyholders 
we cannot accurately predict when catastrophes may occur  and the number and type of catastrophes can vary widely 
the losses they could cause might significantly exceed our prior experience 
catastrophes include hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  hailstorms  explosions  severe winter weather  fires and acts of terrorism 
our pretax catastrophe losses after reinsurance for the last three years were in in in catastrophe losses in decreased the combined ratio by points in compared with  and points in compared with catastrophe losses in included from the four hurricanes in florida and surrounding states 
catastrophe losses in included from the wildfires in california 
catastrophes were unusually low in relative to historical trends 
expenses the decreases in our expense ratio of points in compared with  and points in compared with were the results of our wide ranging expense improvement efforts  primarily as a result of corporate restructuring initiatives 
where we re headed we anticipate the following factors will impact growth and profitability in our property segment in the near future rates in property  we plan to file for rate increases to at least keep pace with the rate of underlying loss cost growth 
actual rate changes obtained may vary from this based on regulatory review and approval and development in loss cost trends 
we anticipate that rate increases combined with premium trend will at least keep pace with overall loss cost changes 
business growth as our business grows  we will write more policies in markets where we previously have not written significant business 
we expect to write more standard risks which have  on average  higher frequencies than preferred risks  but will remain selective 
we are continuing to expand into eastern states where we have less geographic presence currently  being selective on where we write business to manage our catastrophe exposure 
commitment to ease of doing business our commitment to ease of doing business continues through our safeco now automated underwriting platform by lowering our distributors costs and providing an easy to use web based sales and service platform 
our homeowners and dwelling fire products are available on safeco now in all of the states where we write business

this allows us to offer policies to a wider range of small businesses 
this is a key competitive advantage  as we can better segment our business and provide the best rate to our best customers  while higher risks are charged higher rates 
this also has allowed us to improve retention of our best customers 
commitment to ease of doing business safeco now is contributing to increased new business as it allows our distributors to quote and issue new business online in just minutes

this increases retention of business for us as distributors are able to shift their policy servicing activities to us 
these services are provided through our regional service center and include customer billing  claims servicing  policy renewal and endorsements 
field specialization model we have created two separate underwriting units one for our core small business and one for our mid market business 
we expect that this new approach  the field specialization model  will increase efficiency and underwriting accuracy and reduce underwriting expenses due to the automation of many of our underwriting processes and the use of multi variate models 
implemented in  this model has increased productivity while reducing underwriting staff expenses

where we re headed growth given the increasing number of small businesses in the united states and the lack of a dominant market leader  we see growth potential in this segment  and it is our goal to be the leading insurance writer 
as we continue to roll out our automated underwriting platform and safeco now technology  we will grow our business by focusing on small business policies and making it easy for our distributors to sell and service business with us 
in the fourth quarter of  we expanded our bop product by adding additional classes of business  and we expect to add more classes in in july  after reviewing reforms and closely monitoring the market  we lifted a new business moratorium on the california workers compensation market  and we now write policies for existing small account customers in approximately classes of low hazard business for accounts where we already write bop  commercial auto or cmp policies 
competition we are experiencing increased competition in our mid market business customers who pay annual written premiums from  to 
historically  this business is more price competitive as industry profit margins expand 
some carriers are lowering rates to be more price competitive  particularly in the commercial property line where rates appear to be adequate 
however  inflation in building materials costs is increasing and will impact loss costs 
we remain committed to disciplined pricing of our business based on loss cost trends and meeting our profit margin targets 
we will further compete in this segment through our field specialization model  creating a focus on distributor relationships and increasing retention by providing superior customer service 
we also will continue to emphasize ease of doing business through product and service expansion on safeco now 
product pricing and segmentation we will continue to appropriately match rate with risk through segmentation and disciplined underwriting 
we will charge prices to earn acceptable profit margins and decline to write business when pricing or risk does not allow us to earn our target returns 
we are reviewing our deductibles  pricing and coastal proximities as a result of the hurricanes in florida and surrounding states to reduce our exposure to catastrophes 
we are currently implementing our automated underwriting platform for cmp  which provides more accurate pricing and segmentation and makes it easier for distributors to write these policies with us 
in  we do not expect significant changes from our current pricing 
loss costs we anticipate that medical costs  auto repair and building material costs will continue to rise 
we strive to effectively manage these costs through efficient claims handling to help offset increased loss costs

we will maintain our disciplined underwriting approach as a priority while we grow this business 
automated underwriting platform during  surety implemented safeco now for the automated underwriting of small  low risk transactional bonds 
while this currently represents less than of our surety premiums  it has good long term growth potential

impact of terrorism the terrorism risk insurance act of tria requires insurance companies to offer terrorism coverage to all commercial policyholders 
that includes workers compensation and surety policyholders 
tria does not apply to personal lines policyholders and will expire on december  unless congress re authorizes the law 
we believe that re authorization of tria would enable companies to continue to provide terrorism coverage at relatively stable prices 
if tria is not re authorized  we will continue to provide terrorism coverage at least for the current effective periods of commercial policies issued or renewed in we are closely following congressional activity on this subject 
us government funding under tria  the us government will provide funding to the insurance industry if a terrorist attack is certified as such by the secretary of the treasury in concurrence with the secretary of state and attorney general of the united states 
the criteria for certification include the act is dangerous to human life  property or infrastructure  is committed by an individual or individuals on behalf of any foreign person or foreign interest  and the act results in aggregate losses of or more 
funding from tria will be of the certified terrorist losses in excess of individual insurance company deductibles  up to billion 
tria determines the deductibles for insurance companies as a percentage of their direct earned premiums 
our estimated deductible for is terrorism exclusions prior to the enactment of tria  our policies excluded losses due to foreign terrorism in states that had approved the exclusions 
with tria  we can no longer exclude losses due to foreign terrorism unless the policyholder rejects our mandatory offer of terrorism coverage 
the insurance services office iso created coverage and pricing tools to help insurers respond to the tria requirements 
if the policyholder does reject our mandatory offer of terrorism coverage  we can then exclude coverage for losses due to foreign terrorism 
the iso has filed exclusions for acts of terrorism as defined by tria  and we have adopted those filings 
however  some states limit the use of terrorism exclusions 
reinsurance options the availability of terrorism reinsurance is limited in the commercial reinsurance market 
our current reinsurance program provides limited terrorism coverage 
all reinsurance treaties exclude certified terrorist acts and also non certified terrorist acts involving nuclear  chemical  biological or radioactive materials 
treaties providing both certified and non certified terrorist acts include our workers compensation reinsurance program  our commercial umbrella reinsurance program and our commercial basket retention treaty 
our property catastrophe treaty provides non certified terrorism coverage for of excess of 
table of contents our exposure is modest we believe our exposure to potential terrorism losses is relatively modest across all our product lines 
with commercial insurance  our focus is on small to medium sized businesses generally not viewed as likely potential terrorism targets 
with workers compensation policies  the number of employees covered is a key consideration 
we decline to provide coverage in cases where we believe the exposure is potentially severe 
with our personal lines of insurance  we believe that losses due to terrorism would likely be relatively modest 
we believe that exposure and risk to individuals are small

table of contents capital resources and liquidity our liquidity needs p c insurance liabilities are somewhat unpredictable and largely short in duration 
the payments we make to policyholders depend upon losses they suffer from accidents or other unpredictable events that are covered by insurance 
while we estimate how much cash we ll need and when we ll need it based on prior experience and the mix of business we write  we cannot predict all future events  particularly catastrophes 
so we generally invest in high quality securities with greater liquidity investments that can quickly be turned into cash to support our projected or potential need for funds 
sources of our funds we get cash from insurance premiums  dividends  interest  sales or maturity of investments and debt and equity offerings 
we have not engaged in the sale of investments or other assets by securitization 
the cash flow from our operating activities for the past three years was in in in the increase was due to cash received from premium growth of billion in  billion in and billion in  and lower insurance claims paid of billion in  billion in and billion in  reflecting our improved underwriting results 
dividends and interest received on our investment portfolio of in  in and in  also contributed to the increase in cash flow 
we believe that cash flows from our operations  investment portfolio and bank credit facility are sufficient to meet our future liquidity needs 
how we use our funds we use funds to support our operations  make interest and principal payments on debt  pay dividends to our shareholders and grow our investment portfolio 
we use cash from insurance operations primarily to pay claims and claim adjustment expenses 
we require insurance premiums to be paid in advance 
as a result  cash flows into our business before or at the time premium revenues are recognized 
cash flows out of our business in subsequent months or years as claims are paid

accelerated stock buyback on august   we repurchased  shares  or approximately of our outstanding common stock under an asb program 
the shares were purchased from a dealer at a price of per share  for a total of including transaction costs 
through the asb program  we returned excess capital from the l i sale to shareholders and immediately reduced the number of our common shares outstanding 
the dealer obtained the shares that we purchased by borrowing them in the open market  and then the dealer repurchases shares in the market over the following six to nine months to repay the borrowed shares 
of the asb is subject to a collar  a contract that sets a minimum and maximum price for us for the shares repurchased under the collar 
at the end of the program  we may receive  or be required to pay  a price adjustment based on volume weighted average price of our common stock during the period of the asb repurchases 
this adjustment will be recorded in shareholders equity

our contractual obligations our contractual obligations at the end of were payment by total less than year years years more than years long term debt  including interest operating leases pension obligations purchase obligations subtotal loss and lae reserves total loss and lae reserves represent our best estimate of losses from claims and related settlement costs 
because of the nature of insurance policies  there is typically no minimum contractual commitment associated with covered claims 
both the amounts and timing of such payments are estimates  and the inherent variability of resolving claims as well as changes in market conditions make the timing of cash outflows uncertain 
therefore  the ultimate amount and timing of loss and lae payments could differ from our estimates

as we have continued to execute our plans to improve p c operating results  our financial position has strengthened 
our debt service coverage has improved over the last two years  and we expect that to continue in factors that determine financial strength ratings in determining financial strength ratings  the rating agencies focus on results of operations capital resources debt to capital ratio management expertise marketing investment operations minimum policyholders surplus requirements capital sufficiency to meet projected growth access to capital impact of financial strength ratings lower financial strength ratings could materially and adversely affect our company and its performance and could increase the number of customers who terminate their policies decrease new sales increase our borrowing costs limit our access to capital restrict our ability to compete regulatory considerations there are no recently passed  or recommendations calling for  regulations that would materially affect our liquidity  capital resources or results of operations 
a number of state legislatures and insurance regulatory agencies have enacted laws and regulations that limit the use of credit information in the underwriting process 
additional states are considering doing so 
our p c businesses use insurance scoring  which is partially based on credit information in making risk selection and pricing decisions 
limitations or prohibitions on the use of credit information could negatively affect our p c business plans 
various states departments of insurance and attorneys general have responded to recent publicity surrounding broker compensation issues by issuing inquiries and subpoenas to insurance companies and 
table of contents insurance producers domiciled or doing business in their states 
to date  we have received inquiries or subpoenas from the california  illinois  missouri  oregon  north carolina  texas and washington departments of insurance and the california attorney general 
we have responded or are responding as these arrive 
we have no reason to believe  and do not believe  that these events will materially or adversely impact our financial condition  operating results or liquidity 
dividend payments from our subsidiaries our insurance subsidiaries pay dividends to safeco corporation 
we then use those funds to pay dividends to our shareholders as well as to make principal and interest payments on our debt 
individual states limit the amount of dividends that our subsidiaries domiciled in those states can pay us 
exceeding such limits would require prior regulatory approval 
in  our insurance subsidiaries can pay up to in dividends without obtaining prior regulatory approval 
these amounts are according to the limits states had in place at the end of risk based capital the national association of insurance commissioners naic and state regulators use risk based capital rbc formulae to identify companies that are undercapitalized and that may merit further regulatory attention or action 
our insurance subsidiaries have more than sufficient capital to meet rbc requirements 
income taxes at december   we had approximately of gross deferred income tax assets 
gross deferred income tax assets are composed of temporary differences created as a result of amounts deductible for taxes in future periods 
our deferred income tax assets include capital loss carryforwards of that expire in and alternative minimum tax carryforwards of that carryforward indefinitely 
although realization of deferred income tax assets is not assured  we believe they will be realized through future earnings  including but not limited to the generation of future operating income  reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies 
accordingly  we have not recorded a valuation allowance for these assets 
american jobs creation act this act was signed into law on october  and largely focuses on provisions related to international and manufacturing operations  but it also imposes more rigorous tax disclosure and reporting rules and significant penalties for noncompliance and includes provisions that limit the traditional flexibility of executive deferred compensation plans 
we are currently reviewing our nonqualified deferred compensation plans and assessing the new law s impact on our operations  but we do not expect that it will have a material impact on our financial condition  operating results or liquidity 
pension plans our pension obligations resulted from the defined benefit pension plan we sponsor covering substantially all employees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the plan and its effect on the consolidated financial statements 
amounts recorded for net periodic pension cost and the benefit obligation at the measurement date are affected by the changes in assumptions used to determine the weighted average discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
to calculate our benefit obligation  as of december   we used a weighted average discount rate of based on an evaluation of the nature and timing of the pension obligations 
specifically  we calculated an equivalent discount rate on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed maturities with future cash flows that match the timing and amount of our estimated future benefit payments 
we used an expected long term rate of return on our investments of  by considering the mix of investments within the plan as well as actual investment experience during the lifetime of the plan 

table of contents to calculate net periodic pension cost for the year ended december   we used a weighted average discount rate of and an expected long term rate of return of 
a decrease of basis points in the weighted average discount rate would result in an increase of in pension cost in a decrease of basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in an increase of in pension cost in new accounting standards see discussion of new accounting standards in note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures for financial instruments this table shows the fair values of certain of our financial instruments on our consolidated balance sheets at december  and to analyze the sensitivity of our financial instruments to changes in interest rates and equity prices  we show in the second column in the table for each year the effect a basis point increase in market interest rates would have on the fair values 
in the third column for each year we show the effect a decline in equity prices would have on fair values increase decrease in asset or liability increase decrease in asset or liability december fair value change in interest rates change in equity prices fair value change in interest rates change in equity prices financial assets fixed maturities marketable equity securities cash and cash equivalents derivative financial instruments interest rate swaps financial liabilities notes due notes due notes due notes due debentures due market risk is our potential loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
in addition to market risk  we are exposed to other risks  including credit risk related to our investments underlying insurance risk related to our core businesses the sensitivity analysis used for the table summarizes only the market risk related to our recorded financial assets and liabilities 
we seek to maintain reasonable average durations for all of our financial assets and liabilities 
we try to maximize income without sacrificing investment quality while providing for liquidity and diversification 
we calculate the estimated fair values at the adjusted market rates by using discounted cash flow analysis and duration modeling  where appropriate 
the adjusted market rates assume a basis point increase in market interest rates 

table of contents this sensitivity analysis provides only a limited  point in time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed above 
the actual impact of market interest rate and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in this sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis is further limited because it does not consider any actions we could take in response to actual and or anticipated changes in interest rates and equity prices 
the sensitivity analysis excludes certain non financial instruments such as insurance liabilities 
accordingly  any aggregation of the estimated fair value amounts or adjusted fair value amounts does not equal the underlying fair value of net equity
