item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality  inflation  and economic downturns included elsewhere in this report 
our market is highly competitive  and some of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do 
we expect the market for our products and services to remain highly competitive 
our failure to remain competitive may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we face direct competition from third party payment processors and companies that market software for the electronic payment industry 
we also compete against software and transaction processing systems developed and used in house by our potential customers 
our competitors may develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services 
the size of our competitors varies across market segments  as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target 
therefore  certain of our competitors may have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  or other resources than we do in each of our market segments or overall 
as a result  our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or may devote greater resources than we can to the development  promotion  sale  and support of their products and services 
moreover  new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and rapidly decrease our market share 
we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors  especially those with significantly greater resources than we have 
accordingly  competitive pressures may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 

table of contents completing and integrating acquisitions may be difficult 
as part of our growth strategy  we routinely pursue acquisitions of companies whose businesses extend or complement ours 
we cannot  however  assure you that we will be able to successfully acquire suitable target companies on favorable terms or integrate these companies with our existing business 
if we complete an acquisition  we cannot assure you that the acquisition will enhance our business  results of operations or financial condition in the future 
we may require additional debt or equity financing for future acquisitions
