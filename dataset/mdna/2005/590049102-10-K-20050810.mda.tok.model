item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading manufacturer of technologically advanced printed circuit boards for use in sophisticated electronic equipment 
our principal products are complex multi layer printed circuit boards  which are the platforms used to interconnect microprocessors  integrated circuits and other components that are essential to the operation of electronic products and systems 
during the past year  we continued to advance the technology of our printed circuit boards and enhance our quick turn and premium services capabilities 
with the acquisition of merix san jose in december  we established ourselves as a top quick turn producer in north america 
we significantly expanded our sales representative network and added a number of new customers and many new programs with existing customers 
we focused on reducing our cost structure and improving productivity throughout our operations 
in addition  we made significant progress on our strategy to establish asian manufacturing capabilities as evidenced by the announcement on april  of our intent to acquire eastern pacific circuits in hong kong and china 
we expect to complete this transaction in the near future 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  ii the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  iii and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate and update our estimates and judgments  including those related to the collectability of accounts receivable  realizability of inventories  estimated costs of warranty obligations  impairment of long lived assets  estimated obligation associated with the retirement of assets  estimated legal expenses  valuation of goodwill  valuation of identifiable intangible assets and valuation of deferred income tax assets 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among other policies  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable we recognize revenue upon the shipment of our products to the customer provided that we have received a purchase order  the price is fixed  title has transferred  product returns are reasonably estimable  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining significant performance obligations 
we maintain an allowance for estimated sales adjustments based on historical experience 
an estimate of future sales adjustments is recorded as an allowance against accounts receivable at the time of sale 
depending upon the nature of the item as described below  the expense is recorded as either a reduction in net sales or an increase in operating expenses 
when a customer receivable requires adjustment  the amount is written off against the allowance for sales adjustments 
sales adjustments include small pricing discrepancies  which are charged against net sales  disputed freight charges  which are charged against cost of sales  or other customer accommodations  which are typically charged against operating expenses 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimates are based on historical experience  current economic and 
table of contents industry conditions and the profile of our customer mix 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
these adjustments are charged against selling  general and administrative expense 
accounts receivable is presented net of these allowances in the consolidated balance sheet 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketability in amounts equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions were to be less favorable than we projected  additional inventory write downs could be required 
long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
factors which could trigger an impairment review include a significant decline in operating results relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of assets  changes in technology or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if this review indicates that the value of an asset may be impaired  we make an evaluation of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the asset is not recoverable  the net carrying value of the asset will be reduced to fair value and the remaining depreciation period may be adjusted 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements if and when an impairment charge is recorded 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the warranty obligation includes a provision based on historical experience  as well as reserves for specific issues we identify 
to the extent actual warranty charges vary from our historical experience  we may revise the estimated warranty liability 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
an adjustment to deferred tax assets is charged to income in the period such a determination is made 
in fiscal  we initially recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets because of operating losses 
our financial results in fiscal and supported maintaining a full valuation allowance and we have adjusted the valuation allowance accordingly 
if and when we return to profitability  we will reverse the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets  which will result in a reduction of income tax expense 

table of contents results of operations results of operations information in thousands of dollars and as a percentage of net sales are as follows years ended may  percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit loss operating expenses engineering selling  general and administrative amortization of identifiable intangibles restructuring and related activities total operating expenses operating income loss interest income interest expense other expense  net income loss before taxes income tax expense net income loss comparison of fiscal years and net sales net sales were million in fiscal  an increase of over net sales of million in fiscal the increase was due to an increase in unit shipments partially offset by a decrease in average pricing 
fiscal includes million revenue generated by merix san jose since the date of acquisition 
unit shipments were higher in fiscal than in fiscal the increase in unit shipments is due to the addition of new customers  increased business from existing customers and the acquisition of merix san jose 
average pricing decreased by approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in average pricing in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to pricing pressures within the industry as well as a reduction in quick turn and premium services revenue as a percent of net sales 
net sales of quick turn and premium services products that typically command a higher average sales price than standard volume orders as a result of rapid prototype manufacturing or compressed lead time volume orders  comprised approximately of net sales in fiscal compared to approximately in fiscal while net sales of quick turn and premium services consisted principally of compressed lead time volume orders in fiscal  net sales of these services in fiscal consisted of a relatively higher mix of quick turn prototype orders 
the increase in the level of quick turn prototype orders is primarily the result of our focus to grow this business and the acquisition of merix san jose 
sales attributed to our five largest original equipment manufacturer oem customers comprised and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
two oem customers each accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal and we expect to continue to depend upon a small number of customers for a significant portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
the loss of or decrease in orders from one or more major customers could materially reduce our sales 

table of contents sales attributed to oems include sales made through their electronic manufacturing service providers 
the percentage of our net sales made through electronic manufacturing service providers was approximately and in fiscal and  respectively  and we expect these sales to continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales 
although our contractual relationship is with the electronic manufacturing service provider  most of our shipments to electronic manufacturing service providers are directed by oems who negotiate product pricing and volumes directly with us 
in addition  we are on the approved vendor list of several electronic manufacturing service providers and are awarded discretionary orders directly from some of them 
at the request of a number of significant customers  we have implemented vendor managed inventory programs 
we expect to receive similar requests from additional customers in in these programs  we produce and ship products to the customer  but retain ownership until the customer elects to take delivery 
the customer commits to accept delivery within a specified period of time  typically to weeks  but is not committed to take delivery at any particular time 
we record a sale only after the customer accepts delivery 
these programs have reduced our ability to accurately forecast sales on a period to period basis and have also had a negative impact on our compressed lead time volume sales 
additionally  the programs have increased our levels of finished goods inventory 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in both fiscal and fiscal in  a decrease in gross margin from lower capacity utilization as a result of capacity expansion activities was primarily offset by a higher margin sales mix from sales by merix san jose 
cost of goods sold in fiscal reflects a full year of incremental direct and indirect cost of expanded capacity  due largely to the commencement of production at our wood village facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the additional fixed overhead resulting from the merix san jose acquisition 
while capacity expansion is critical for future growth and has facilitated our increase in unit production  it has increased our cost structure and caused a decline in the overall utilization of our installed capacity in fiscal compared to fiscal lower capacity utilization reduces gross margin because it results in a higher cost per unit produced 
in addition  we have experienced increases in supplier pricing on certain materials that we have not been able to pass through to customers 
merit increases were reinstated in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which increased salary expense 
the negative effects on gross margin from lower capacity utilization  increased materials pricing and merit increases were largely offset by higher margins in the sales mix provided by merix san jose 
engineering engineering expenses were million  or of net sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal the increase in engineering expense in absolute dollars is primarily due to the capitalization of  of qualified internal engineering costs related to our capacity expansion project in fiscal that did not occur in fiscal  as well as the addition of  of expenses from merix san jose 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in the amount of expense is largely attributed to the addition of million of expenses from merix san jose  as well as  of expenses related to the abandonment of a business opportunity in asia 
fiscal also included incremental legal fees of  from the prior year related to the defense of securities litigation and increased expenses of  for audit and consulting fees related to compliance with the internal control provisions of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
in addition  merit increases were reinstated in the fourth quarter of fiscal which increased salary expense 
interest income interest income increased to million in fiscal from  in fiscal due to higher yield on investment balances as a result of higher interest rates in fiscal 
table of contents interest expense interest expense increased slightly to million in fiscal from million in fiscal interest primarily consists of interest on the million convertible debenture 
other expense  net other expense  net  increased slightly to  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal income taxes the provision for income taxes for fiscal and represent our minimum state income tax and foreign tax obligations 
our effective income tax rate was approximately zero for fiscal and fiscal due to adjustments to a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that was established as a result of an accumulation of net operating loss carryforwards 
we incurred additional net operating tax losses in fiscal and fiscal and  accordingly  we increased our gross deferred tax asset and the corresponding valuation allowance  which resulted in no income tax benefit for these periods 
the internal revenue code limits the amount of otherwise taxable income that may be offset by net operating loss carryforwards if certain changes in stock ownership occur  including certain changes in ownership of stock by passive institutional investors 
if those changes in ownership of our stock occur  we may be limited in the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that we can use in any given year to reduce our income subject to tax 
the company underwent such a change in fiscal the company does not believe that the limitation will significantly impact its ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards 
comparison of fiscal years and net sales our net sales in fiscal were million  an increase of from net sales of million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in unit shipments and an increase in average pricing 
unit shipments were higher in fiscal than in fiscal the increase in volume was the result of increased end market demand as well as new program gains from existing customers and the addition of new customers 
average pricing decreased throughout fiscal as a result of changes in our product mix and competitive pricing pressures in our industry 
average pricing increased throughout fiscal primarily as a result of mix changes  including increased demand for premium services and for products incorporating high speed laminate materials  and overall price increases as manufacturing capacity utilization in the printed circuit board industry improved 
net sales of quick turn and premium services increased to of net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal net sales of quick turn and premium services in fiscal included higher levels of both prototype and compressed lead time volume orders  while net sales of quick turn and premium services in fiscal consisted principally of prototype and pre production orders 
we believe the level of prototype orders increased due to our focus on growing this business 
in the first three quarters of fiscal  compressed lead time volume orders increased rapidly as a result of higher customer demand combined with longer standard lead times 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  compressed lead time volume sales declined as a percentage of net sales relative to the prior three quarters due to a shortening of standard lead times and a decline in demand for these services 
sales in the communications end market represented and of our net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in net sales in the communications end marked was due largely to a strengthening of that industry  which we believe grew faster than the other end markets we serve 
sales attributed to our five largest oem customers comprised and of our net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
approximately and of our net sales were made to our oem customers electronic manufacturing service providers in fiscal and  respectively 
two oem customers accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal and 
table of contents gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales was positive in fiscal and negative in fiscal the increase in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in manufacturing capacity utilization  a lower variable cost structure  increased productivity and a higher margin sales mix  partially offset by increased fixed costs 
manufacturing capacity utilization improved due to increased demand  which enhances gross margin because fixed costs are spread over a higher number of units produced  decreasing the cost per unit 
the lower variable cost structure primarily resulted from reductions in supplier pricing for materials and other cost reduction actions 
restructuring and related activities  which were primarily completed in the third quarter of fiscal  generated cost savings compared to the prior year  but were offset by the increased costs associated with resuming the expansion of the wood village manufacturing facility beginning the second quarter of fiscal and the ramping of production in that facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal increased productivity reflects a higher lever of output per headcount 
a shift to a higher margin sales mix was the result of changes in customer demand  including higher levels of quick turn and premium services revenue 
engineering engineering expenses were million  or of net sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal the decrease in engineering expenses is primarily due to the capitalization of qualified internal engineering costs related to our capacity expansion project in fiscal  offset by an increase in incentive compensation 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense primarily resulted from increased headcount in the sales organization  higher incentive compensation  and higher commissions to outside sales firms 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we accrued  of legal fees to defend pending securities class action claims 
restructuring and related activities during the third quarter of fiscal  we executed a restructuring plan that consisted of a voluntary layoff and the relocation of certain operations 
the relocation had a positive impact on our cost structure  cycle time and productivity 
in addition  we recorded a related charge for impaired assets that resulted from the restructuring 
the plan was substantially completed during the third quarter of fiscal and a charge of million was recorded during the year for restructuring and related activities 
interest income interest income decreased to  in fiscal from million in fiscal due to a lower yield on investment balances as a result of lower interest rates 
interest expense interest expense declined slightly to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and primarily consists of to interest on the million convertible debenture 
other expense  net other expense  net  decreased to  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal  primarily due to certain non operating charges for outside services recorded in fiscal income taxes the provision for income taxes for fiscal of million was primarily the result of a million charge to income tax expense recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  representing a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets that we established as a result of an accumulation of net operating losses 
our 
table of contents effective income tax rate was zero for fiscal due to adjustments to a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
we incurred additional net operating tax losses in fiscal and we increased our gross deferred tax asset and the corresponding valuation allowance  which resulted in no income tax benefit or expense for the year 
liquidity and capital resources at the end of fiscal  we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments 
the principal source of liquidity in fiscal was the maturity of short term investments and cash provided by operating activities 
in fiscal  we used cash principally to finance capital expenditures and the merix san jose acquisition 
in addition  cash was used to fund the increase in net working capital 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million  compared to cash provided by operations of million in fiscal our operating cash flow of million for fiscal primarily reflects a net loss of million  adjusted for million of depreciation and amortization  offset by a net increase in working capital accounts of million  excluding cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
the increase in working capital  excluding cash and investments  is primarily the result of an increase in accounts receivable and other assets 
the increase in these accounts was primarily caused by increased sales and production activity from fiscal to fiscal cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal cash used in investing activities in fiscal primarily consisted of million for the investment in merix san jose and million used for capital expenditures for manufacturing equipment 
these investments were primarily funded through million from the maturity of short term investments net of purchases 
at the end of fiscal  we had firm capital commitments of approximately million relating to the purchase of manufacturing equipment 
in fiscal  the million used in investment activities resulted from the investment of proceeds obtained in the public offering of our common stock 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was  compared to million in the prior year 
net cash flow from financing activities in fiscal consisted of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options  whereas fiscal primarily reflects net proceeds of million from a public offering our common stock 
the following summarizes significant contractual obligations for merix at the end of fiscal and the effect of such on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 
payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations convertible debenture note payable expected interest on debt operating leases capital purchase obligations expected cash payments  adjusted for inflation  for asset retirement obligation epc purchase agreement total on april   we entered into a master sale and purchase agreement the agreement with eastern pacific circuits holdings limited epc 
pursuant to the agreement  the company is to acquire the operations of epc  a hong kong based supplier of printed circuit boards  for a total purchase price of million  
table of contents subject to adjustment based on changes in working capital and subject to an additional earn out payment of up to million if the business meets certain adjusted ebitda targets in calendar our obligation to close is not subject to the availability of financing 
we expect to pay the purchase price using a combination of cash on hand and debt financing  which has not yet been arranged 
the convertible debenture is unsecured  is convertible into shares of our common stock at a fixed conversion price of  and is callable after august if certain conditions are met 
interest is payable quarterly  and the debenture contains a put option that entitles the holder to require us to redeem the debenture at a price equal to of the principal balance upon a change in control of merix 
we believe that our existing capital resources  cash generated from operations and cash anticipated to be obtained through debt financing should be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next months 
risk factors affecting business and results of operations the following risk factors and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in our forward looking statements  whether made in this annual report on form k or the other documents we file with the sec  or in our annual or quarterly reports to shareholders  future press releases  or orally  whether in presentations  responses to questions or otherwise 
acquisitions may be costly and difficult to integrate  may divert management resources and may dilute shareholder value 
as part of our business strategy  we have made and may make acquisitions of  or investments in  companies  products or technologies that complement our current products  augment our market coverage  enhance our technical capabilities or production capacity or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
in connection with any acquisitions or investments  we could issue stock that would dilute our current shareholders percentage ownership  incur debt and assume liabilities that could impair our liquidity  incur amortization expenses related to intangible assets  incur large and immediate write offs that would reduce net income  or abandon an acquisition effort after incurring significant expenses 
acquisitions also could pose numerous additional risks to our operations  including problems integrating the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated expenses and working capital requirements  achieving sufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions  diversion of management s attention from our core business and our expansion efforts  adverse effects on business relationships with our or the acquired company s suppliers and customers  entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience  and potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the acquired organization 
any of these factors could prevent us from realizing anticipated benefits of an acquisition or investment  including operational synergies  economies of scale and increased profit margins and revenue 
acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  and any future acquisition may not be successful 
failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could harm our business and operating results in a material way 
even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products  product enhancements may not be made in a timely fashion 
in addition  unforeseen issues might arise with respect to such products after the acquisition 

table of contents we are dependent upon the electronics industry  which has historically suffered significant downturns in demand resulting in excess manufacturing capacity and increased price competition within our industry 
the electronics industry  on which our business depends  has historically been cyclical and subject to significant downturns characterized by diminished product demand  rapid declines in average selling prices and over capacity 
although the industry has seen improvement from the latest significant downturn  the industry may continue to experience relatively low demand and continued price depression and is likely to experience recessionary periods in the future 
the economic conditions affecting the electronics industry  in general  or any of our major customers  in particular  have adversely affected our operating results and may continue to do so in the future 
the electronics industry is characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change  relatively short product life cycles and pricing and margin pressures 
when these factors adversely affect our customers  we suffer similar effects 
our customers are primarily high technology equipment manufacturers in the communications  high end computing and test and measurement end markets of the electronics industry 
due to the uncertainty in the markets served by most of our customers  we cannot accurately predict our future financial results or accurately anticipate future orders 
at any time  our customers can discontinue or modify products containing components manufactured by us  adjust the timing of orders and shipments or affect our mix of net sales generated from quick turn and premium services versus standard lead time production  any of which could adversely affect our results of operations 
because we do not have long term contracts with our customers  we are subject to uncertainties and variability in demand and product mix by our customers  which could decrease net sales and negatively affect our operating results 
as is common in our industry  we generally do not have long term contracts with our customers  and  consequently  our net sales are subject to short term variability in demand by our customers 
customers have no obligation to order from us and may cancel  reduce or delay orders for a variety of reasons 
the level and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to fluctuation in demand for our customers products  changes in customers manufacturing strategies  such as a decision by a customer to either diversify or consolidate the number of printed circuit board manufacturers used  customers inventory management  changes in customers requirement for quick turn and premium services  and changes in new product introductions 
we have experienced terminations  reductions and delays in our customers orders 
further terminations  reductions or delays in our customers orders could lower our production asset utilization  which would lower our gross margins  decrease our net sales and negatively affect our business 
lower sales may cause gross margins and operating results to decrease because many of our operating costs are fixed 
a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature  and planned expenditures are based in part on anticipated orders 
if we do not receive orders as anticipated  our operating results will be adversely affected 
revenue shortfalls resulting from decreased demand for our products have historically resulted in an underutilization of our installed capacity and  together with adverse pricing  have decreased our gross margins 
future decreases in demand or pricing may decrease our gross margins 

table of contents competition in the printed circuit board market is intense  and we could lose sales if we are unable to compete effectively 
the market for printed circuit boards is intensely competitive  highly fragmented and rapidly changing 
we expect competition to persist  which could result in continued reductions in pricing and gross margins and loss of market share 
we believe our major competitors are united states and international independent producers that manufacture multi layer printed circuit boards  provide backplanes and other electronic assemblies  and offer quick turn services 
those competitors include dynamic details inc  multek a division of flextronics international ltd  sanmina sci  ttm technologies inc  tyco international ltd 
and viasystems  inc 
many of our competitors and potential competitors may have a number of significant advantages over us  including significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and manufacturing resources  preferred vendor status with some of our existing and potential customers  and larger customer bases 
in addition  these competitors may have the ability to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies  may adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements and may devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
consolidation in the printed circuit board industry  which we expect to continue  could result in an increasing number of larger printed circuit board companies with greater market power and resources 
such consolidation could in turn increase pricing and competitive pressures for us 
we must continually develop improved manufacturing processes to meet our customers needs for complex  high technology products  and our basic interconnect technology is generally not subject to significant proprietary protection 
we may not be able to maintain or expand our sales if competition increases and we are unable to respond effectively 
during recessionary periods in the electronics industry  our competitive advantages in providing an integrated manufacturing solution and responsive customer service may be less important to our customers than they are in more favorable economic climates 
pending or future litigation could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
we are currently subject to legal proceedings and claims  including several securities class action lawsuits and shareholder derivative lawsuits 
more lawsuits could be filed against us 
see part i  item  legal proceedings 
where we can make a reasonable estimate of any probable liability relating to pending litigation  we record a liability 
although we have created a reserve for some of the potential legal fees associated with litigation currently pending against us  we have not created any reserve for potential liability for settlements or judgments because the potential liability is neither probable nor estimable 
even when we record a liability  the amount of our estimates of costs or liabilities could be wrong 
accordingly  our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in addition to the direct costs of litigation  pending or future litigation could divert management s attention and resources from the operation of our business 
accordingly  our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
as production capabilities increase in asia  where production costs are lower  we may lose market share and our gross margins may be adversely affected by increased pricing pressure 
price competition from printed circuit board manufacturers in asia and other locations with lower production costs may play an increasing role in the printed circuit board markets in which we compete 
while printed circuit board manufacturers in these locations have historically competed primarily in markets for less technologically advanced products  they are expanding their manufacturing capabilities to produce higher layer 
table of contents count  higher technology printed circuit boards 
as a result of these factors  competitors in asia may be able to effectively compete in our market segment  which may force us to lower our prices  reduce our gross margins or decrease our net sales 
because a small number of customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales  our net sales could decline significantly if we lose a major customer or if a major customer orders fewer of our products or cancels or delays orders 
historically  we have derived a significant portion of our net sales from a limited number of customers 
our top five oem customers  which vary from year to year  represented  and of our net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect to continue to depend upon a small number of customers for a significant portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
the loss of  or decline in  orders from one or more major customers could reduce our net sales 
some of our customers are relatively small companies  and our future business with them may be significantly affected by their ability to continue to obtain financing 
if they are unable to obtain adequate financing  they will not be able to purchase products  which  in the aggregate  would adversely affect our net sales 
because we have significant foreign sales and intend to expand our global presence  we are subject to political  economic and other risks we do not face in the domestic market 
while approximately and of our net sales in fiscal and  respectively  were attributed to oem customers domiciled outside of the united states  and  respectively  related to products shipped outside of the united states  primarily to the foreign facilities of electronic manufacturing service providers  as directed by our oem customers 
we expect sales in  and product shipments to  non us markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales in the future 
in addition  upon completion of the pending epc acquisition we will be producing printed circuit boards in hong kong and china 
our exposure to the business risks presented by foreign economies will increase to the extent we continue to expand our global operations 
global operations subject us to a number of risks  including inflation or changes in political and economic conditions  logistical  communications and other operational difficulties in managing a global enterprise  potentially adverse tax consequences  restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of a country  difficulty in attracting and training workers in foreign markets and problems caused by labor unrest  less protection of our proprietary processes and know how  longer sales cycles  multiple  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  protectionist and trade laws and business practices that favor local companies  price and currency exchange controls  and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable 
additionally  fluctuations in the strength of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies may provide a price advantage to foreign competitors 
we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and as a result of a concentration of our customer base 
most of our sales are on an open credit basis  with standard industry payment terms 
we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting open credit arrangements  seek to limit open credit to 
table of contents amounts we believe the customers can pay  and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts 
during periods of economic downturn in the global economy and the electronics industry  our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases 
although we have programs in place to monitor and mitigate the associated risk  those programs may not be effective in reducing our credit risks 
five companies represented approximately of our net trade accounts receivable at may   with individual percentages for those companies ranging from to 
our oem customers direct our sales to a relatively limited number of electronic manufacturing service providers 
our contractual relationship is typically with the electronic manufacturing service providers  who are obligated to pay us for our products 
because we expect our oem customers to continue to direct our sales to electronic manufacturing service providers  we expect to continue to be subject to the credit risk of a limited number of customers 
this concentration of customers exposes us to increased credit risks 
if one or more of our significant customers were to become insolvent or were otherwise unable to pay us  our results of operations would be harmed 
if we lose key management  engineering  sales and marketing and professional services personnel  we could experience reduced sales  delayed product development and diversion of management resources 
our success depends largely on the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing and professional services personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
although we have employment and non compete agreements with our key personnel  if one or more members of our senior management or key professionals were to resign  the loss of personnel could result in loss of sales  delays in new product development and diversion of management resources  which would have a negative effect on our business 
we do not maintain key man insurance policies on any of our personnel 
our manufacturing process depends on the collective experience of our employees 
if these employees were to leave us and take this knowledge with them  our manufacturing process may suffer and we may not be able to compete effectively 
we rely on the collective experience of our employees in the manufacturing process to ensure we continuously evaluate and adopt new technologies 
although we are not dependent on any one employee or a small number of employees involved in our manufacturing process  if a significant number of our employees involved in manufacturing were to leave our employment and we were not able to replace these people with new employees with comparable experience  our manufacturing process could suffer as we may be unable to keep up with innovations in the industry or the demands of our customers 
as a result  we may not be able to continue to compete effectively 
products we manufacture may contain manufacturing defects  which could result in reduced demand for our services and liability claims against us 
we manufacture highly complex products to our customers specifications 
these products may contain manufacturing errors or failures despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts 
defects in the products we manufacture  whether caused by a design  manufacturing or materials failure or error  may result in delayed shipments  customer dissatisfaction  or a reduction in or cancellation of purchase orders 
if these defects occur either in large quantities or too frequently  our business reputation may be impaired 
since our products are used in products that are integral to our customers businesses  errors  defects or other performance problems could result in financial or other damages to our customers beyond the cost of the printed circuit board  for which we may be liable 
in addition  certain of our products are used in applications  such as aircraft  where failure could have devastating effects on end users 
although sales arrangements generally contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability and related claims  existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could negate these limitation of liability provisions 
product liability litigation against us  even if it were unsuccessful  would be time consuming and costly to defend 
although we maintain a warranty reserve  this reserve may not be sufficient to cover our warranty or other expenses that could arise as a result of defects in our products 

table of contents we rely on suppliers for the timely delivery of materials used in manufacturing our printed circuit boards  and an increase in industry demand or a shortage of raw materials may increase the price of these raw materials and limit our ability to manufacture certain products 
to manufacture our printed circuit boards  we use materials such as laminated layers of fiberglass  copper foil and chemical solutions that we order from our suppliers 
suppliers of laminates and other raw materials that we use may from time to time extend lead times  limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors  which could adversely affect our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis 
some of our products use types of laminates that are only available from a single supplier that holds a patent on the material 
although other manufacturers of advanced printed circuit boards also must use the single supplier and our oem customers determine the type of laminates used  a failure to obtain the material from the single supplier for any reason may cause a disruption  and possible cancellation  of orders for printed circuit boards using that type of laminate  which in turn would cause a decrease in our net sales 
if we are unable to respond to rapid technological change and process development  we may not be able to compete effectively 
the market for our manufacturing services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continual implementation of new production processes 
the future success of our business will depend in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities  to manufacture products that meet changing customer needs  and to successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost effective and timely basis 
in addition  the printed circuit board industry could encounter competition from new or revised manufacturing and production technologies that render existing manufacturing and production technology less competitive or obsolete 
we may not be able to respond effectively to the technological requirements of the changing market 
if we need new technologies and equipment to remain competitive  the development  acquisition and implementation of those technologies and equipment may require us to make significant capital investments 
we may not be able to raise additional funds in order to respond to technological changes as quickly as our competitors 
our failure to comply with environmental laws could adversely affect our business 
our operations are regulated under a number of federal  state and municipal environmental and safety laws and regulations that govern  among other things  the discharge of hazardous and other materials into the air and water  as well as the handling  storage and disposal of such materials 
while we believe that our operations substantially comply with applicable environmental laws  we may violate environmental laws and regulations in the future as a result of our failure to have necessary permits  human error  equipment failure or other causes 
if we violate environmental laws  we may be held liable for damages and the costs of investigations and remedial actions and may be subject to fines and penalties  and revocation of permits necessary to conduct our business 
any permit revocations could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities  and harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
even if we ultimately prevail  environmental lawsuits against us would be time consuming and costly to defend 
our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could limit our ability to expand facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with these laws and regulations 
over the years  environmental laws have become more stringent  imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations 
we operate in environmentally sensitive locations and we are subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas of political  business and environmental groups 
changes or restrictions on discharge limits  emissions levels  permitting requirements and material storage  handling or disposal might require a high level of unplanned capital investment  operating expenses or  depending on the severity of the impact of the foregoing factors  costly plant relocation 
it is possible that environmental compliance costs and penalties from new or existing regulations may harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are potentially liable for contamination at our current and former facilities as well as at sites where we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes  if such sites become contaminated 
these liabilities could include investigation and remediation activities 
it is possible that remediation of these sites could adversely affect our business and operating results in the future 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our funds available for investment 
we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities 
we do not believe that changes in interest rates would have a material effect on our liquidity  financial condition or results of operations 
we do not have interest rate risk in our long term debt and do not enter into interest rate swap agreements 
a change in interest rates would not affect interest expense on the million  convertible debenture or the million  note payable because each of those instruments bear a fixed rate of interest 
we do not have exposure to foreign exchange risk as all sales are currently denominated in us dollars
