partially offsetting the above increases to net income were the following crude unit outages at valero energy s mckee refinery in the second and third quarters of and a turnaround at valero energy s benicia refinery in the fourth quarter of  increased operating expense due to the following excluding the impact of and acquisitions higher incentive compensation expense  higher power costs as a result of higher natural gas prices  and increased internal overhead costs due to the amendment to the services agreement  under which overhead previously allocated to valero energy is now borne by valero lp higher general and administrative expense primarily due to the amendment to the services agreement effective april   between valero lp and valero energy for services rendered by valero energy corporate employees

revenues for the crude oil pipelines increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due primarily to increased revenues related to the ardmore crude oil pipelines 
during the second quarter of  valero energy s ardmore refinery experienced a major refinery turnaround for most of april  resulting in lower throughput and revenues in the ringgold to wasson to ardmore crude oil pipelines for as compared to although operating expenses for the crude oil pipelines segment were comparable in the aggregate for the year ended december  and the year ended december   certain components of operating expenses increased while others decreased 
power costs were higher during due to higher electricity rates as a result of higher natural gas prices and an expansion of the wichita falls crude oil pipeline by adding a pump station in the fourth quarter of in addition  higher employee benefit costs in were related to higher incentive compensation 
these operating expense increases were offset by the transfer of the corpus christi north beach storage facility  including its operating expense  from the crude oil pipeline segment to the crude oil storage tank segment effective january

index to financial statements environmental  health and safety valero lp is subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations  including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment  waste management  pollution prevention measures  pipeline integrity and operator qualifications  among others 
because environmental and safety laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental and safety laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed  the level of future expenditures required for environmental  health and safety matters is expected to increase 
valero energy has agreed to indemnify valero lp for a period of approximately years from the date of acquisition  for pre acquisition environmental liabilities related to the assets transferred or otherwise acquired by valero lp from valero energy or uds

as an operator or owner of the assets  valero lp could be held liable for pre acquisition environmental liabilities should valero energy be unable to fulfill its obligation 
however  valero lp believes that such a situation is remote given valero energy s financial condition

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions related thereto that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following summary provides further information about valero lp s critical accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with note of the consolidated financial statements  which summarizes valero lp s significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenues are derived from interstate and intrastate pipeline transportation of crude oil and refined products  the storage and throughput of crude oil and the terminalling and blending of refined products 
transportation revenues are based on pipeline tariffs that are subject to extensive federal and or state regulation 
terminalling and blending revenues are based on fees which valero lp believes are market based 
reductions to the current pipeline tariffs or terminalling and blending fees charged could have a material adverse effect on valero lp s results of operations 
for the year ended december   of valero lp s revenues were derived from valero energy and valero energy has agreed not to challenge certain of valero lp s pipeline tariffs or terminalling fees until at least april see note of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of valero lp s relationship with valero energy 
depreciation depreciation expense is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of valero lp s property and equipment 
because of the expected long useful lives of the property and equipment  valero lp depreciates its property and equipment over periods ranging from years to years 
changes in the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment could have a material adverse effect on valero lp s results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill long lived assets are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
goodwill must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset goodwill is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
in order to test for recoverability  management must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset which include  but are not limited to  assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset  estimated remaining life of the asset  and future expenditures necessary to maintain the asset s existing service potential 
in order to determine fair value  management must make certain estimates and assumptions including  among other things  an assessment of market conditions  projected cash flows  investment rates  interest equity rates and growth rates  that could significantly impact the fair value of the long lived asset or goodwill 
due to the subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair value  significant impairment charges could result in the future  thus affecting valero lp s future reported net income

index to financial statements asset retirement obligation effective january   valero lp adopted statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which established accounting standards for recognition and measurement of a liability for an asset retirement obligation and the associated asset retirement cost 
an entity is required to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
if a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period the asset retirement obligation is incurred  the liability should be recognized when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
in order to determine fair value  management must make certain estimates and assumptions including  among other things  projected cash flows  a credit adjusted risk free rate  and an assessment of market conditions that could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the asset retirement obligation 
these estimates and assumptions are very subjective 
valero lp has determined that it is obligated by contractual or regulatory requirements to remove assets or perform other remediation upon retirement of certain assets 
however  the fair value of the asset retirement obligation cannot currently be reasonably estimated because the settlement dates are indeterminate 
valero lp will record an asset retirement obligation in the periods in which it can reasonably determine the settlement dates
