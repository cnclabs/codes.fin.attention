item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background we are a diversified global services provider and manufacturer of a broad range of industrial products and systems  organized into two business segments  tools supplies and engineered solutions 
our tools supplies segment is primarily involved in the design  manufacture and distribution of branded hydraulic and electrical tools and supplies to the retail  construction  electrical wholesale  industrial  oil gas  production automation and marine markets 
our engineered solutions segment primarily focuses on developing and marketing highly engineered position and motion control systems for original equipment manufacturers in the recreational vehicle  automotive  truck and other industrial markets 
we believe that our strength in these product categories is the result of a combination of our brand recognition  proprietary engineering and design competencies  dedicated service philosophy  and global manufacturing and distribution capabilities 
our long term goal is to grow annual diluted earnings per share excluding unusual or non recurring items eps by to per year 
we intend to leverage our leading market positions to generate annual internal sales growth that exceeds the annual growth rates of the gross domestic product in the geographic regions in which we operate 
in addition to internal sales growth  we are focused on acquiring complementary businesses 
following an acquisition  we seek to drive cost reductions  develop additional cross selling opportunities and deepen customer relationships 
we also focus on profit margin expansion and cash flow generation to achieve our eps growth goal 
our lead lean enterprise across disciplines process utilizes various continuous improvement techniques to drive out costs and improve efficiencies across all locations and functions worldwide  thereby expanding profit margins 
strong cash flow generation is achieved by maximizing returns on assets and minimizing primary working capital needs 
the cash flow that results from efficient asset management and improved profitability is used to reduce debt and fund additional acquisitions and internal growth opportunities 
our application of this strategy has generated profitable growth and reduced debt leverage over the past five years

the results of operations for acquired businesses are included in our reported results of operations only since their respective acquisition dates 
see note  acquisitions in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in addition to the impact of acquisitions on operating results  currency translation rates can influence our reported results given approximately of our sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the weakening of the us dollar over the past three fiscal years has favorably impacted comparisons of fiscal to fiscal results and fiscal to fiscal results due to the translation of non us dollar denominated subsidiary results

fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in fiscal increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal  primarily resulting from the dresco acquisition and million of currency translation rates 
excluding the dresco acquisition and currency rate changes  sales increased 
north american sales increased driven by strong enerpac sales due to improving economic conditions in the region  whereas european sales declined by due to the positive impact in the first half of fiscal of kopp s electrical line fills at certain european home centers and fiscal enerpac sales related to the millau viaduct project  which were not repeated in fiscal gross profit in fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million primarily due to higher sales 
excluding the million impact of foreign currency rate changes on translated results  gross profit increased 
gross profit margins increased slightly from during fiscal to for fiscal due to margin expansion at enerpac and kopp 
enerpac s improvement reflects successful efforts in material cost reductions and other lead initiatives  while kopp benefited from declines in manufacturing capacity and overhead  implementing lean manufacturing techniques  and shortening cycle time 
these positive results were partially offset by the impact of dresco s comparatively lower profit margins 
sae increased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million for the fiscal year

sales to the rv market decreased during fiscal versus fiscal due to lower rv original equipment manufacturer oem production levels as the oem s reduced production levels to reduce excess finished goods 
the automotive convertible top actuation business realized a year over year sales decline of during fiscal as a result of the impact of the introduction of several new convertible platforms in the prior year  compared to none in the current year

excluding the million impact of foreign currency rate changes on translated results  gross profit increased 
gross profit margins did not change in fiscal  remaining at 
automotive business gross profit margins in fiscal were lower than those experienced in fiscal due to inefficiencies and manufacturing variances resulting from the production start ups of new convertible top platforms and the launch of production at our north america automotive plant

sae increased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million for the fiscal year 
excluding the million impact of foreign currency rate changes on translated results  sae increased 
the increase is primarily due to the impact of the kwikee acquisition and increased spending to support automotive business growth

all debt is considered to be for general corporate purposes  thus  financing costs and charges for early extinguishment of debt have not been allocated to the reportable segments 
the increase in financing costs during fiscal versus the prior year reflects the interest expense on the debt incurred for fiscal acquisitions  offset by the impact of the company s gradual replacement of million of outstanding senior subordinated notes notes throughout fiscal with lower interest rate debt such as the convertible notes 
the company s overall weighted average debt cost has significantly declined as a result of replacing the notes with less expensive forms of debt 
see liquidity and capital resources below for further information

we incurred an aggregate pre tax charge of million in fiscal to retire the notes  comprised of million of premium payments made to bondholders  million for the non cash write off of unamortized debt discount and capitalized debt issuance costs  million for the non cash write off of fair value adjustments to the notes for fixed rate to variable rate interest rate swaps underlying the notes  and million of legal and professional fees 
in february  the company entered into a million five year senior revolving credit facility the revolver 
the revolver replaced the senior secured credit agreement  which had a final maturity of june all borrowings outstanding under the senior secured credit agreement were repaid in february and the company was released from any remaining obligations 
the early extinguishment resulted in a non cash  pre tax charge of approximately million in the second quarter of fiscal  representing the non cash write off of remaining capitalized debt issuance costs 
other income expense increased in fiscal due to a million settlement gain on the reimbursement of a tax refund to a former subsidiary 
see note  discontinued operations in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
fiscal compared to fiscal general corporate sae increased by million  from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal this increase resulted from a million increase in incentive compensation provisions due to favorable fiscal results  a million charge recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal to reflect new information for a pre existing environmental matter  and increased spending due to additional headcount and costs related to sarbanes oxley section compliance  severance costs  increased staffing to support our growth initiatives  and increased spending on tax planning services and acquisition advice 
although net debt levels increased during fiscal to fund acquisitions and pay premiums to retire the notes  net financing costs decreased by million 
this decline is the result of the gradual replacement  via open market and negotiated repurchases and the completion of the august tender offer  of the notes with lower interest rate debt  and lower market interest rates during fiscal as compared to fiscal see liquidity and capital resources below for further information 

table of contents during the first quarter of fiscal  the company retired million of its notes acquired through a negotiated purchase 
the company recorded a pre tax charge of million related to the redemption of the notes 
the pre tax charge consisted of million of bond redemption premium payments and a million non cash write off of the associated debt discount and debt issuance costs 
in fiscal  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million to recognize the impact of adverse developments in two separate litigation matters associated with businesses divested prior to the spin off of the electronics segment in july  for which the company retained indemnification risk 
both matters were resolved and funded during fiscal year other income of million in fiscal including a million net foreign currency translation gain related to the liquidation of two foreign subsidiaries 
income tax expense the company s income tax expense is impacted by a number of factors  including the amount of taxable earnings derived in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates that are higher or lower than the us federal statutory rate  state tax rates in the jurisdictions where we do business  and our ability to utilize various tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards 
the company s effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations in fiscal was  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the effective income tax rate was higher in fiscal as a result of the negative tax impact of the charges for early extinguishment of debt on the utilization of foreign tax credits 
in addition  the fiscal effective income tax rate was lower due to a reduction in statutory rates in the netherlands  a comparatively lower tax rate in the united kingdom where both the hydratight sweeney and hedley purvis businesses are based  and the realization of benefits on certain net operating losses that previously had not been benefited 
for more information regarding the variations in effective tax rates for the periods presented  see note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
discontinued operations see note  discontinued operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the results of our discontinued operations 
restructuring reserves the company committed to integration plans to restructure portions of kopp s operations during the first quarter of fiscal these plans were designed to reduce administrative and operational costs 
the remaining million of accrued severance costs at august  will be paid to former employees over the next two years as dictated by contractual arrangements with those employees 
a rollforward of the severance reserve follows in thousands accrued severance costs as of august  cash payments currency impact accrued severance costs as of august  
table of contents in connection with the kci acquisition in december  the company committed to a plan to close kci s corporate headquarters and terminate all of the related employees 
a restructuring reserve of million  primarily for severance payments to the terminated employees  was recorded in the purchase price allocation 
as of august  the corporate office had been closed and the remaining million of restructuring reserve primarily reflects the remaining lease costs on the idle corporate office space 
critical accounting policies the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
this requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following policies are considered by management to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventory cost is determined using the last in  first out lifo method for a portion of us owned inventory approximately and of total inventories at august  and  respectively 
the first in  first out or average cost method is used for all other inventories 
if the lifo method were not used  the inventory balance would be higher than the amount in the consolidated balance sheet by approximately million and million at august  and  respectively 
each of the company s business units perform an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to market value 
the inventory valuation assumptions used are based on historical experience 
the company believes that such estimates are made with consistent and appropriate methods  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
goodwill and long lived assets the company s goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the company performs impairment reviews for its reporting units using a fair value method based on management s judgments and assumptions 
the fair value represents the amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an arms length basis 
in estimating the fair value  the company uses multiples of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda based on prevailing marketplace valuations 
the company has determined that this approach to measuring fair value is the most appropriate 
the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
independent appraisers are retained to perform additional fair value calculations in situations where our fair value calculations approximate the carrying value of the reporting unit 
the company is subject to financial statement risk to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
the impairment testing performed by the company at august   indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount  and  as such  no impairment existed 
indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing  as well 
on an annual basis  the fair value of the indefinite lived assets are estimated by the company and compared to the carrying value to determine if an impairment charge is required 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
if such indicators are present  the company performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists 
if an impairment is determined to exist  any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value 
a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests  principally in determining the fair value of each reporting unit and the indefinite lived intangible assets 
while the company believes its judgments and assumptions were reasonable  different assumptions could change the estimated fair values and  therefore  impairment charges could be required 

table of contents employee benefit plans the company provides a variety of benefits to certain of its employees and retired employees  including  in some cases  pensions and postretirement health care 
plan assets and obligations are recorded based on the company s measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  assumed rates of return  and health care cost trend rates as of that date 
the discount rate used by the company is based on the interest rate of noncallable high quality corporate bonds  with appropriate consideration of local market factors for foreign benefit plans and the company s benefit plans participants demographics and benefit payment terms 
at august  and  the company s weighted average discount rate on domestic benefit plans was and  respectively 
a change in the discount rate by basis points would impact the company s domestic benefit plan expense in fiscal year by less than million 
at august  and  the company s weighted average discount rate on foreign benefit plans was to  respectively 
a change in the discount rate by basis points would impact the company s foreign benefit plan expense in fiscal year by less than million 
in estimating the expected return on plan assets  the company considers the historical returns on plan assets  adjusted for forward looking considerations  inflation assumptions and the impact of the active management of the plans invested assets 
domestic benefit plan assets consist primarily of participating units in common stock and bond funds 
the company assumed its expected return on domestic benefit plan assets to be at both august  and a basis point change in this assumption would impact fiscal domestic benefit plan expense by less than million 
due to the insignificance of the foreign benefit plan assets  the expected return on plan assets does not materially impact the company s results of operations 
see note  employee benefit plans for further discussion 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
as required by us gaap  the effects of the modifications are recorded currently or amortized over future periods 
based on information provided by its independent actuaries and other relevant sources  the company believes that the assumptions used are reasonable  however  changes in these assumptions could impact the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
income tax expense recognized by the company also reflects its best estimates and assumptions regarding  among other things  the level of future taxable income and effect of the company s various tax planning strategies 
future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws  changes in projected levels of taxable income  and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company 
use of estimates the company has recorded reserves or allowances for customer returns and discounts  doubtful accounts  incurred but not reported medical claims  environmental issues  warranty claims  workers compensation claims  product and non product litigation  and incentive compensation 
these reserves require the use of estimates and judgment 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company believes that such estimates are made with consistent and appropriate methods 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million at august  and  respectively 
our goal is to maintain low cash balances  utilizing any excess cash to pay down debt to minimize financing costs 

table of contents the company reported cash provided from continuing operations of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash flows in fiscal and include the impact of premiums paid to bondholders for the repurchases of our notes net of the related tax benefit of million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal results from the combination of our focus on working capital management including the sale of acquired domestic accounts receivable  cash generated by businesses acquired in fiscal  and the premiums paid in the prior year for note repurchases  offset by the million tax refund paid to a former subsidiary in fiscal cash provided from operating activities  after considering the impact of the premiums paid to repurchase notes  increased as compared to fiscal due to improved profitability resulting from the kwikee and dresco acquisitions and core business growth  reduced cash payments for interest of approximately million  and active management of our primary working capital

in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities totaled million 
in november  the company sold an aggregate principal amount of million of convertible senior subordinated debentures due convertible notes  which generated net proceeds of million which was used to retire other high cost debt  including redeeming the remaining million of our notes 
we also replaced our senior secured credit agreement in fiscal with a lower cost million senior revolving credit facility the revolver 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  with the majority representing debt repayments 
commitments and contingencies the company leases certain facilities  computers  equipment and vehicles under various operating lease agreements  generally over periods from one to twenty years 
under most arrangements  the company pays the property taxes  insurance  maintenance and expenses related to the leased property 
many of the leases include provisions that enable the company to renew the lease based upon fair value rental rates on the date of expiration of the initial lease 
see note  leases  in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the timing of commitments table below for further information 

table of contents the company is contingently liable for certain lease agreements held by businesses included in its former electronics segment  which was distributed to shareholders in fiscal the distribution 
some of these businesses were subsequently sold to third parties 
if any of these businesses do not fulfill their obligations under the leases  the company could be liable for such leases 
the discounted present value of future minimum lease payments for such leases total approximately million at august  the future undiscounted minimum lease payments for these leases are as follows million in the balance of calendar  million in calendar  million in calendar  million in calendar  million in calendar  and million thereafter 
as more fully discussed in note  accounts receivable securitization in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company is party to an accounts receivable securitization arrangement 
trade receivables sold and being serviced by the company were million and million at august  and  respectively 
if the company were to discontinue this securitization program  at august  it would have been required to borrow approximately million to finance the working capital increase 
total capacity under the program is million 
in august the company recorded income of million  or per diluted share  in discontinued operations  net of income taxes to reflect the release of a reserve for tax and other obligations related to the distribution  based on its evaluation that no amounts will be due as a result of the former subsidiary rejecting such agreements 
the company had outstanding letters of credit of million and million at august  and  respectively 
the majority of the letters of credit secure self insured workers compensation liabilities 
during fiscal  a dividend of per share was declared and is payable on october  to shareholders of record september  dividends were not declared or paid during fiscal or at august   the company had approximately million of availability under the revolver 
the company believes that such availability  plus funds generated from operations  will be adequate to meet operating  debt service and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
timing of commitments the timing of payments due under the company s contractual commitments is as follows contractual obligations a years ended august  long term debt obligations operating lease obligations b total amounts in s thereafter total a the above table excludes the additional payments for acquisition earn out payments  as the exact amount and timing of payments is not known 
for further information see note  acquisitions 
b the company s purchase obligations generally relate to amounts due under contracts with third party service providers 
these contracts are primarily for real estate leases  information technology services  including software and hardware support services and leases  and telecommunications services 
those purchase obligations  such as leases  that are not cancelable are included in the table 
the company 
table of contents routinely issues purchase orders to numerous vendors for the purchase of inventory and other supplies 
these purchase orders are generally cancelable with reasonable notice to the vendor  and as such  they are excluded from the contractual obligations table 
seasonality and working capital we have met our working capital needs and capital expenditure requirements through a combination of operating cash flow and availability under revolving credit facilities 
although there are modest seasonal factors within certain of our businesses  on a consolidated basis  we do not experience material changes in seasonal working capital or capital resource requirements 
our receivables are derived from a diverse customer base in a number of industries 
the largest single customer generated approximately of fiscal net sales 
capital expenditures the majority of our manufacturing activities consist of the assembly of components that are sourced from a variety of vendors 
we believe that our capital expenditure requirements are not as extensive as many other industrial companies given the assembly nature of our operations 
capital expenditures for the fiscal years ended august    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
capital expenditures have historically been funded by operating cash flows and borrowings under revolving credit facilities 
for the past three fiscal years  capital expenditures were invested primarily in machinery and equipment and computer systems 
capital expenditures for fiscal are estimated to be approximately million 
raw material costs and inflation we source a wide variety of materials and components from a network of global suppliers 
while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers  commodity raw materials  such as steel  plastic resin  and copper  are subject to price fluctuations  which could have a negative impact on the company s results 
the company strives to pass along such commodity price increases to customers to avoid profit margin erosion 
in addition  lead initiatives further mitigate the impact of commodity raw material price fluctuations as improved efficiencies across all locations are achieved 
the company has not entered into any derivative contracts to hedge its exposure to commodity risk in fiscal years   or no meaningful measures of inflation are available because we have significant operations in countries with diverse rates of inflation and currency rate movements 
however  we believe that the overall rate of inflation in recent years has been relatively low and has not had a significant effect on our results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs sfas 
sfas required that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage be recognized as current period charges 
further  sfas requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
unallocated overheads must be recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the company expects that the adoption of sfas will not have a material effect on the financial statements 
the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment during the fourth quarter of fiscal and used the modified retrospective method of adoption 
stock based compensation expense for was calculated using the black scholes option pricing model for options granted in the first and second quarters and the binomial pricing model for options granted in the last two quarters of the fiscal year 
assumptions used to 
table of contents determine the fair value of each option were based upon historical data and standard industry valuation practices and methodology 
the total impact of sfas no 
r on fiscal is a million reduction to net earnings  or a per share reduction in diluted earnings per share 
the company adopted eitf no 
 the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share during the second quarter of fiscal the company s convertible notes are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of the company s class a common stock once the common stock trades above per share for a specified period of time a market price trigger 
eitf requires companies with contingently convertible debt instruments to include the dilutive effect of the contingently convertible debt in the diluted earnings per share calculations regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met 
prior period diluted earnings per share for each quarter in fiscal  as well as the first quarter of fiscal  were restated at the time of adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and  to a lesser extent  commodities 
to reduce such risks  the company selectively uses financial instruments and other proactive management techniques 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures  which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
a discussion of the company s accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included within note  summary of significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated financial statements 
currency risk the company has exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
approximately   and of its revenues for the years ended august   and  respectively  were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
of those us dollar denominated amounts  approximately   and  respectively  were denominated in euro  with the majority of the remainder denominated in various asian and other european currencies 
the company does not hedge the translation exposure represented by the net assets of its foreign subsidiaries 
foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of shareholders equity 
the company s identifiable foreign currency exchange exposure results primarily from the anticipated purchase of product from affiliates and third party suppliers and from the repayment of intercompany loans between subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies 
the company periodically identifies areas where it does not have naturally occurring offsetting positions and then may purchase hedging instruments to protect against anticipated exposures 
there are no material hedging instruments in place as of the date of this filing 
the company s financial position is not materially sensitive to fluctuations in exchange rates as any gains or losses on foreign currency exposures are generally offset by gains and losses on underlying payables  receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
interest rate risk the company has earnings exposure related to interest rate changes on its outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are based on libor and euribor interest rates
