company profile overview jefferson pilot corporation jp is a holding company whose financial services and broadcasting subsidiaries provide products and services in four major businesses life insurance  annuities and investment products  group life  disability and dental insurance  and broadcasting and sports programming production 
our principal life insurance subsidiaries are jefferson pilot life insurance company jp life  jefferson pilot financial insurance company jpfic and its wholly owned subsidiary  jefferson pilot lifeamerica insurance company jpla 
jefferson pilot communications company jpcc and its wholly owned subsidiaries conduct our broadcasting operations 
jefferson pilot securities corporation with related entities  jpsc is a registered non clearing broker dealer that sells mutual funds  affiliated and non affiliated variable life and annuity products and other investment products 
in our three financial services segments  effective investment management and asset liability management are important to our financial position and results of operations 
interest spread  which represents the difference between interest earned on our investments and interest credited to policyholder funds  is a key component of our results for individual life insurance and annuities products 
the earned rate on our investment portfolio has declined steadily in recent years as a result of a decline in the general interest rate environment 
we believe that the historically low interest rate levels that we have experienced will continue to challenge our earnings progression 
our operating results also depend on the level of mortality death and morbidity disability and health costs we incur 
we attempt to address these factors through underwriting risk selection and classification  by adjusting policyholder crediting rates to achieve desired spread performance for our individual life insurance and annuity products  by monitoring claim and industry health care trend reports for our group insurance products  and through a focus on conservative product designs 
also  we record substantial intangible asset balances because we defer commissions and expenses incurred in selling new policies deferred policy acquisition costs  and because of acquisitions of in force blocks of insurance value of business acquired and goodwill 
the assumptions that we use in accounting for these intangible assets are important to our reported results 
for a more complete explanation of these important concepts  please see the critical accounting policies and estimates  investments and market risk exposures sections of this report 
due to competition from other financial services providers  it is important that we achieve continuing improvements in internal cost efficiencies in relation to policies administered and assets under management 
our individual products segment sells life insurance on individuals  through which we underwrite the economic risks of mortality and provide vehicles for the accumulation of individual savings 
we select and classify mortality risks within a competitive marketplace and a highly regulated industry 
because we earn revenues for accepting mortality risks  the growth in face amount of insurance in force is a key measure for a portion of our revenue growth 
we further analyze this segment by its two unique product types ul type products and traditional products 
ul type products offered by this segment include universal life ul and variable universal life vul products 
ul type product premiums may vary over the life of the policy at the discretion of the policyholder  so we do not recognize them as revenues when received  although ul type premiums do increase assets and liabilities 
we earn spreads between interest earned and credited to policyholders from aggregation and investment of policyholder funds 
in managing these spreads  we develop and maintain systems and skills that are necessary to understand and mitigate credit and interest rate risks 
we also recognize revenues on ul type products from mortality  expense and surrender charges earned policy charges 
trends in policyholder fund balances and segment assets are important measures when analyzing the development of segment earnings 
traditional products require the policyholder to pay scheduled premiums over the life of the coverage 
we recognize traditional premium receipts as revenues and profits are expected to emerge in relation thereto 
because of market preferences  we do not currently offer new traditional products except for some term life insurance 
product development is important to growth in sales 
we operate within a competitive marketplace by offering products that respond to demographic changes  the evolving financial needs of our customers  and regulatory requirements 
we currently sell individual life insurance products designed to provide our customers vehicles for wealth accumulation  mortality protection  and a balance between those two objectives 
because this segment issues long duration contracts  sales results may not materially impact current period profitability  but longer term sales trends are an important indicator of future growth in earnings 
our annuity and investment product aip segment primarily offers our proprietary fixed annuity products 
we also sell mutual funds and other investment products through our broker dealer 
we earn interest spreads and policy charges on our annuity products  and recognize revenues from concession income earned on investment product sales by our broker dealer 
the principal source of segment results is investment spreads on policyholder fund balances 
investment selection and matching of interest rate risk profiles of investments to those of policyholder fund balances are critical to achieving successful results within this segment 
in recent years  historically low interest rates have reduced the margin between rates we credit to policyholder accounts and those that are guaranteed under contractual provisions  which limits our ability to reduce crediting rates 
we have responded to that exposure through innovative product designs that reduce spreads required to achieve desired returns 
because we derive a majority of our earnings from spread management activities  trends in policyholder fund balances and effective investment spreads earned are both important drivers of segment results 
product development activities are important to providing appropriate products to a highly competitive marketplace 
we have introduced new products with fixed interest and equity index components over the last two years that have contributed to improving sales trends 
with careful hedging of the economic risk of equity index components  these products impact our earnings similarly to fixed interest products 
sales of traditional fixed interest  multi year guarantee products declined in the two most recent years because of competition from other financial services products within a declining interest rate environment 
new fixed annuity premium sales and surrenders of existing policies are both key indicators of trends in policyholder fund balances 
our benefit partners segment insures individuals for mortality  morbidity and dental costs under master group insurance contracts with employers 
this segment offers various forms of contributory and noncontributory plans  as well as supplemental contracts 
most of our group contracts are sold to employers with fewer than employees 
we select and classify risks within a competitive marketplace based on group characteristics  applying actuarial science and group underwriting practices 
we may adjust premiums charged for insuring group risks  usually on an annual basis  in relation to evolving group characteristics and subject to policyholder acceptance 
insurance products offered by this segment to the employer marketplace include group non medical products  principally term life  disability and dental insurance 
as these are traditional products  we recognize premium receipts from this segment as revenues and profits are expected to emerge in proportion to the revenue recognized 
because group underwriting risks may change over time  management focuses on trends in loss ratios to compare actual experience with pricing expectations 
also  expense ratios are an important factor in profitability since group insurance contracts are offered within an environment that competes on the basis of price and service 
reported sales relate to long duration contracts sold to new policyholders 
the trend in sales is an important indicator of development of business in force over time 
effective march   we acquired substantially all of the us based group life  disability and dental business of the canada life assurance company  an indirect subsidiary of great west lifeco inc  via a reinsurance transaction 
as a result of this acquisition  we are positioned with approximately billion of annual group life  disability and dental premiums 
see note for further discussion of the details of this transaction 
our communications segment consists of radio and television broadcasting operations located in selected markets in the southeastern and western united states  and sports program production 
we generate revenues for this segment through advertising  sales of programming rights and other programming compensation 
management evaluates the performance of our broadcast stations using a number of metrics including audience levels ratings  growth in audiences  revenue growth  relative share of market revenues  and operating efficiencies  with the ultimate goal of achieving growth in broadcast cash flow 
we focus our efforts at the local level  combining sound business practices with service to the community 
we monitor each station s product through market research and tailor the product to our target audience s tastes and listening viewing habits 
we attempt to maximize revenues and increase revenue share by focusing on management of commercial inventory and pricing 
we achieve operating efficiencies by exercising tight expense control at both the local and corporate levels 
fcc licenses  which are required for operations  are subject to periodic renewal 
intangible assets related to fcc licenses that are recognized in our financial statements are included within other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
our corporate and other segment contains the activities of the parent company and passive investment affiliates  surplus of the life insurance subsidiaries not allocated to other segments  financing expenses on corporate debt  strategic initiatives intended to benefit the entire company  and federal and state income taxes not otherwise allocated to business segments 
we include all realized gains and losses on investments in the corporate and other segment  and hold all defaulted securities in this segment 
realized investment gains are gains and losses on sales and write downs of investments  and although these are included in revenues and income  we exclude them in assessing the performance of our business segments 
the company s business segments  operating results  risks and opportunities are discussed in further detail in the sections that follow 
segment revenues our segments revenues as a percentage of total revenues  excluding realized gains and losses  were as follows year ended individual products aip benefit partners communications corporate and other critical accounting policies and estimates general we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to the understanding of our results of operations and our financial position 
in applying these critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements  management must use significant judgments and estimates concerning future results or other developments including the likelihood  timing or amount of one or more future events 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments based upon historical experience and various other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
for a detailed discussion of other significant accounting policies  see note dac  voba and unearned revenue reserves the individual products  aip and benefit partners segments defer the costs of acquiring new business 
these costs include first year commissions and incentive compensation and certain costs of underwriting and issuing policies plus agency office expenses 
these deferred expenses are referred to as deferred policy acquisition costs dac 
when we acquire new blocks of business through an acquisition  we allocate a portion of the purchase price based on relative fair values to a separately identifiable intangible asset  referred to as value of business acquired voba 
we initially establish voba as the actuarially determined present value of future gross profits of each business acquired 
both dac and voba are amortized through expenses  as discussed further below 
we defer significant portions of expense charge revenues on certain ul products as unearned revenue reserves  included within other policy liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  and amortize them into income over time using the same assumptions we use for dac and voba 
unearned revenue reserves on ul products were at december   including for vul products 
we report both the deferral and amortization of unearned revenue reserves as revenues within universal life and investment product charges 
dac and voba on ul type products were  or of the gross balances before adjustments for unrealized gains and losses at december   including related to vul products 
we amortize dac and voba on ul type products and annuity products relative to the future estimated gross profits egp over the life of these products 
in calculating the future egp for these products  management must make long term assumptions regarding the following components estimates of fees charged to policyholders to cover mortality  surrenders and maintenance costs  estimated mortality in excess of fund balances accumulated  expected interest rate spreads between income earned  including default charges paid to the corporate and other segment  and amounts credited to policyholder accounts  and estimated costs of policy administration maintenance 
we consider the following assumptions to be most significant to ul type products estimated mortality  estimated interest spreads  and estimated future policy lapses 
in addition to these three assumptions  vul and va products require an additional critical assumption that affects dac and voba amortization  the rate of growth of the separate account mutual funds that generate additional policy fees we use in the egp on vul and va products 
we assume a long term total net return on separate account assets  including dividends and market value increases  of and a five year reversion period 
the reversion period is a period over which a short term return assumption is used to maintain the model s overall long term rate of return 
we cap the reversion rate of return at for one year and for years two through five 
this limitation reduces the cumulative effective long term rate 
we regularly review the models  and the assumptions we used in them  so that the modeled egps reflect management s current view of future events 
at least annually  we compare these assumptions to emerging experience on each of our insurance blocks 
short term deviations in experience  which are reflected as assumption true up adjustments  do not necessarily indicate that a change to our long term assumptions of future experience is warranted 
if we determine that it is appropriate to change our long term assumptions of future experience  we recognize unlocking adjustments for the block of business being evaluated 
certain assumptions  such as interest spreads and lapse rates  may be interrelated 
as such  unlocking adjustments often reflect revisions to multiple assumptions 
the balances of dac  voba  unearned revenue reserves and secondary guarantee benefit reserves discussed in note are immediately impacted by any assumption changes with the change reflected through the income statement 
these adjustments can be positive or negative 
the following table reflects the possible pretax income statement impacts that could occur in a given year if we change our assumptions as illustrated related to ul type products in the individual products segment one time effect on dac  voba  unearned revenue reserves and secondary guarantee benefit reserves favorable unfavorable quantitative change in significant assumptions change change estimated mortality improving degrading per year for years from the current estimate estimated interest spread increasing decreasing basis points per year for years from the current assumed spread estimated policy lapse rates decreasing increasing immediately and then increasing decreasing per year for years estimated long term rate of return from vul assets increasing decreasing using mean reversion techniques our traditional individual and group insurance products are long duration contracts 
we amortize dac and voba related to these products in proportion to premium revenue recognized 
the dac and voba balances on these products were or of the gross balances before adjustments for unrealized gains and losses at december   and are subject to little volatility 
we consider estimated interest spreads and estimated future policy lapses to be the most significant assumptions related to our annuity products 
dac and voba on these products were or of the gross balances before adjustments for unrealized gains and losses at december   including related to va products

note contains rollforwards of dac and voba including the amounts capitalized  amounts amortized and the effect of the unrealized gains 
investments we regularly monitor our investment portfolio to ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are identified in a timely fashion and properly valued  and that any impairments are charged against earnings in the proper period 
our methodology to identify potential other than temporary impairments requires professional judgment and is further described in the investments section and in note for further information on the other than temporary impairments we recognized  refer to the discussion of our realized losses within the investments section 
valuing our investment portfolio involves a variety of assumptions and estimates  particularly for investments that are not actively traded 
we rely on external pricing sources for highly liquid publicly traded securities and use an internal pricing matrix for privately placed securities 
this matrix relies on our judgment concerning the discount rate we use in calculating expected future cash flows  credit quality  industry sector performance  and expected maturity 
under certain circumstances  we make adjustments as we apply professional judgment based upon specific detailed information concerning the issuer 
investments valued using independent third party sources comprised of our investment portfolio at december  with the remainder being valued based upon internal analysis using the assumptions described above 
mortgage loans on commercial real estate represented of investments at december  and are stated at unpaid balances  net of estimated unrecoverable amounts 
in addition to a general estimated allowance  we provide an allowance for unrecoverable amounts when a mortgage loan becomes impaired 
we consider a mortgage loan to be impaired when it becomes probable  based upon management s judgment  that the company will be unable to collect the total amounts due  including principal and interest  according to contractual terms 
we measure the impairment based upon the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate on both a loan by loan basis and by measuring aggregated loans with similar risk characteristics 
we base the general estimated allowance on historical experience  industry experience and other qualitative factors 
as the discussion above indicates  many judgments are involved in timely identifying and valuing investments  including other than temporary impairments on securities 
inherently  there are risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments 
see the discussion of investments and note for further details 
critical assumptions and changes in circumstances such as a weak economy  an economic downturn or unforeseen events which affect one or more companies  industry sectors or countries could result in additional write downs in future periods for impairments  including those that are deemed to be other than temporary 
policy liabilities the liability for future policy benefits pertains to our traditional individual and group insurance products and represents of total liabilities at december  changes in this liability are reflected in the insurance and annuity benefits caption in our consolidated statements of income 
assumptions we use in determining future policy benefits include future investment yields  mortality  morbidity and persistency 
we base estimates about future circumstances principally on historical experience and provide for possible adverse deviation 
though not anticipated  significant changes in experience or assumptions may require us to provide for expected future losses on a product by establishing premium deficiency reserves 
see note for further discussion of the assumptions we use in estimating these liabilities 
the accounting for secondary guarantee benefit reserves related to no lapse guarantees impacts  and is impacted by  certain elements of estimated future gross profits used to calculate amortization of dac  voba and unearned revenue reserves 
if experience or an assumption changes  we unlock secondary guarantee benefit reserves to reflect the changes in a manner similar to dac  voba and unearned revenue reserves 
secondary guarantee benefit reserves are reported within other policy liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
pension plans the measurement of our pension obligations  costs and liabilities depends on a variety of assumptions 
these assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as compensation increases and return on plan assets 
these assumptions may affect the amount and timing of future contributions 
our key assumptions include discount rate  long term rate of return on plan assets and expected compensation rate increase 
see note for further details regarding our pension plans 
at december  and  the fair values of the assets related to the defined benefit pension plans were and the increase in assets reflects the improvement in the equity markets in which the majority of these assets are invested 
the projected benefit obligations at december  and were and with the majority of the growth due to the impact of using a lower discount rate in the liability calculations for due to the declining interest rate environment 
we have lowered the discount rate again for net periodic benefit cost  which includes service cost  interest cost  return on plan assets and net amortization and deferrals of actuarial and investment gains and losses  was  and for  and amortization of actuarial losses primarily related to previous declines in market related values of plan assets resulted in the increase in net periodic benefit cost in goodwill goodwill was at december  and representing and of stockholders equity at these dates 
through december   we amortized goodwill on a straight line basis over periods of to years 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition  and ceased amortization of goodwill 
we regularly review the carrying amounts of goodwill for indications of value impairment  considering financial performance and other relevant factors such as a significant adverse change in the business or legal climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  or unanticipated competition 
if considered impaired  the carrying amounts would be written down to a value determined by using a combination of fair value and discounted cash flows 
absent an indication of impairment  we test goodwill for impairment annually in the month of june 
we concluded that there had been no impairments in or also  we have identified no adverse trends or uncertainties that would suggest that an impairment is imminent 
litigation establishing accruals for specific litigation inherently involves a variety of estimates of future potential outcomes 
accordingly  management  based on the advice of internal counsel  reviews significant litigation matters and makes judgments about whether it is probable we have incurred a loss 
once we determine that a loss is probable  we use professional judgment in determining whether we can reasonably estimate the loss 
in general  we accrue the estimated costs of defense until we can reasonably estimate the loss or any potential range of possible loss 
at that time  we accrue these additional costs 
based on consultation with our legal advisors  we believe that resolution of pending legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity but could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations for a specific period

the individual products and aip segments declined over the same period 
earnings from business added via the canada life transaction favorably impacted the results of benefit partners in communications achieved market share advances and benefited from increased political advertising revenues in resulting in earnings growth 
individual products and aip segments were adversely impacted by spread compression due to lower portfolio yields  partially resulting from lower prepayments of investments 
in  we experienced growth in all segments  including interest spread improvement in our individual and our aip lines favorably impacted by prepayments  and effective expense management across the organization 
these advances were partially offset by higher net investment losses

other than temporary impairments were in an increase in the accrual for pending litigation in our corporate and other segment in affected the comparison to effective january   the company adopted a new accounting standard related to secondary guarantees and other benefit features 
the implementation of this new standard created both a cumulative effect upon adoption as well as a reduction to ongoing net income  as discussed later and in note earnings per share amounts were more favorable than the absolute earnings amounts due to repurchases of  shares in   shares in  and  shares in results by business segment throughout this form k  reportable segment results is defined as net income before realized investment gains and losses and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  if applicable 
reportable segment results is a non gaap measure 
we believe reportable segment results provides relevant and useful information to investors  as it represents the basis on which we assess the performance of our business segments 
we deem reportable segment results to be a meaningful measure for this purpose because  except for losses from other than temporary impairments  realized investment gains and losses occur primarily at our sole discretion 
note that reportable segment results as described above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we assess profitability by business segment and measure other operating statistics as detailed in the separate segment discussions that follow 
we determine reportable segments in a manner consistent with the way we make operating decisions and assess performance 
sales are one of the statistics we use to track performance 
our sales  which are primarily of long duration contracts in the individual products and aip segments  have little immediate impact on revenues for these two segments as described in the segment discussions below

see note for further discussion 
the following table summarizes key data for individual products that we believe are our important drivers and indicators of future profitability favorable unfavorable vs 
vs 
annualized life insurance premium sales individual markets excluding community banks and boli community banks and boli average ul policyholder fund balances average vul separate account assets average face amount of insurance in force total ul type policies average assets sales from our individual markets excluding community banks and bank owned life insurance boli decreased slightly in from in  sales increased over due to continued success of new product introductions during in recent years  increased competition among providers of ul type insurance contracts has resulted in a shortening of the product life cycle 
a focus on product development efforts has resulted in a greater distribution of product offerings for our customers 
sales to community banks and boli business were unchanged in after declining in community bank and boli business will vary widely between periods as we respond to sales opportunities for these single premium products only when the market accommodates our required returns 
approximately  and of life insurance sales were attributable to products with secondary guarantee benefits for  and these products were priced considering interest  mortality  withdrawal and termination lapse assumptions that are specific to the nature  marketing focus and funding pattern for each product 
the lapse assumptions that we use for pricing are based on multi scenario modeling techniques and are lower than the assumptions we use for non guaranteed products  particularly when the secondary guarantee option is in the money 
since guaranteed ul policies are relatively new to the marketplace  credible experience has yet to emerge regarding policy and premium persistency  however  our assumptions represent our best estimate of future experience 
see capital position for discussion of statutory basis reserving methodologies for these types of products 
interest margin on ul type products increased in lower investment yields were mitigated by growth in policyholder fund balances and our management of interest spreads 
as discussed further below  the lower investment yield in was primarily due to the general interest rate environment and lower prepayments from mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage loans 
we actively manage interest spreads on our fixed ul type products in response to changes in investment yields by adjusting the rates credited to policyholder fund balances while considering our competitive strategies as well 
the average investment spread on fixed ul products declined basis points to in after having increased basis points in to 
during and  prepayments of mortgage backed securities significantly increased as a result of continued declines in long term mortgage rates  but then declined rapidly in as mortgage rates stabilized 
this decline was partially offset by an increase in commercial mortgage loan prepayments in our mortgage backed securities portfolio is primarily a discount portfolio 
we estimate that prepayments on mortgage backed securities in excess of expected levels and prepayments of commercial mortgage loans increased effective investment yields by  and basis points in  and the decrease in excess accretion of discount on mortgage backed securities contributed to the decline in effective investment spreads on fixed ul products in our ability to manage interest crediting rates on fixed ul type products is limited by minimum guaranteed rates provided in policyholder contracts 
therefore  continued low general market interest rates likely will impact future profitability  as the investment of cash flows at current interest rates reduces our average portfolio yield 
at the end of and  our crediting rates were approximately and basis points on average in excess of our minimum guaranteed rates  including and of our ul policyholder fund balances that were already at their minimum guaranteed rates 
the increase in product charge revenue was due to growth and aging of our insurance blocks  dynamic adjustments to unearned expense charges  as noted below  and higher surrender rates 
a reinsurance recapture in increased cost of insurance charges cois by excluding this impact  cois grew over  with an increase in the average age of our insureds contributing to growth this contributes to increased death benefits as well 
products issued in recent years are designed to generate a higher proportion of their revenues from expense charges 
we defer expense charges received in excess of ultimate annual expense charges and amortize them into income relative to future estimated gross profits 
the effect of reflecting updated longer term assumptions in estimated gross profits on our insurance blocks decreased the amortization of unearned expense charges by in and increased amortization by in the adoption of a new accounting standard  related to secondary guarantees and other benefits  in impacted estimated gross profits and reduced the amortization of unearned expense charges by excluding the impacts from the new accounting standard and the dynamic adjustment to amortization  expense charges increased over due to changes in product mix  as certain of our newer products with level expense loads represented a higher proportion of sales 
surrender activity also increased during from higher lapses in our boli block of business  resulting in higher surrender charge income 
ul type death benefits and other insurance benefits included for related to the impact of a new accounting standard see note related to secondary guarantees and other benefit features 
the accounting for these benefit features incorporates estimated future gross profits used to calculate amortization of dac  voba and unearned expense charges 
a change in estimated future gross profits will impact other insurance benefits and the amortization of dac  voba and unearned expense charges 
the effect of updating longer term assumptions in estimated gross profits for our insurance blocks decreased other insurance benefits by in see the critical accounting policies and estimates section and note for further discussion 
ul type death benefits in included for the reinsurance recapture mentioned above 
absent the impact of the new accounting standard discussed above and reinsurance recapture items  ul type death benefits and other insurance benefits increased over ul type death benefits  net of reinsurance  per thousand dollars of average net face amount at risk average face amount of insurance in force net of reinsurance and reduced by average policyholder fund balances were in compared to in and in aging of our blocks will continue to contribute to increasing levels of ul type death benefits 
while over the long term death benefits should emerge within actuarial expectations  the level of death benefits will fluctuate from year to year 
traditional premiums and other considerations declined in  and reflecting customer preferences for ul type products 
net investment income from our traditional blocks declined in  due to a decline in investment yields  partly due to lower prepayments of mortgage backed securities  and the decreasing size of the block 
policy benefits on traditional business include death benefits  dividends  surrenders and changes in reserves  with the most significant being death benefits 
policy benefits as a percentage of premiums and other considerations were in  in and in total individual expenses including the net deferral and amortization of dac and voba are as follows favorable unfavorable vs 
vs 
commissions general and administrative acquisition related general and administrative maintenance related taxes  licenses and fees total commissions and expenses incurred less commissions and expenses capitalized expenses excluding amortization of dac and voba amortization of dac and voba total expense expenses  excluding amortization of dac and voba  were higher in due to lower capitalization of commissions and expenses 
taxes  licenses and fees decreased from a reduction in our effective tax rate and state income tax accrual releases following the filing of the tax returns 
the expense amounts we capitalize as dac include first year commissions and deferrable acquisition expenses 
a decrease in acquisition expenses from lower sales and increased efficiencies reflected in our marketing and distribution costs  combined with an increase in product development costs and other maintenance expenses both of which cannot be deferred  resulted in a decline in the proportion of our expenses that are deferrable 
the decline in expenses excluding amortization of dac and voba in was due to a reduction in the effective rate of premium taxes  and effective expense controls in our maintenance functions 
growth in our insurance blocks for ul type products was the primary contributor to the increases in the amortization of dac and voba in the three years presented 
unlocking of assumptions for interest spreads  mortality and lapsation on our blocks of business resulted in reductions in dac and voba amortization on ul type products of  and in  and the unlocking in also included an assumption revision on vul products related to limitation of mean reversion techniques 
additionally  the establishment of secondary guarantee benefit reserves changed the pattern of expected gross profits for the related products  resulting in a decrease in dac amortization in see further discussion of dac and voba under the critical accounting policies and estimates section 
the growth in average individual products assets in and was primarily due to growth in ul policyholder fund balances and market values of separate account assets  partially offset by a decline in assets supporting our traditional block of business 
in  market values of separate account assets of variable products declined 
at december   ul type products sold to community banks accounted for billion in ul policyholder fund balances and have averaged to of earnings for the individual products segment in recent years 
at december   dac and voba balances  net of unearned revenue reserves  related to these blocks amounted to approximately these policies  which are generally not subject to surrender charges  are owned by several thousand policyholders 
these policies were primarily originated through  and continue to be serviced by  two marketing organizations 
the surrender rate for this product may increase beyond current experience due to the absence of surrender charges and rising interest rates that may result in returns available to policyholders on competitors products being more attractive than on our policies in force 
the following factors may influence policyholders to continue these coverages our ability to adjust crediting rates  relatively high minimum rate guarantees  the difficulty of re underwriting existing and additional covered lives  and unfavorable tax attributes of certain surrenders 
our assumptions for amortizing dac  voba and unearned revenue for these policies reflect a higher long term expected lapse rate than other ul blocks of business due to the factors noted above 
lapse experience for this block in a particular period could vary significantly from our long term lapse assumptions 
in addition to the risk factor described in the above paragraph  our financial and operating risks for this segment include failure to achieve pricing assumptions for interest margins  mortality  withdrawals and expenses  variances between actual and underlying assumptions of estimated gross profits  increased lapses when interest rates rise  particularly in fixed interest ul type products subject to low or no surrender charges  changes in taxation or other regulatory changes related to our products and competing offerings  changes in generally accepted or statutory accounting principles such as the axxx actuarial guideline discussed in capital resources  and the effects of unresolved litigation 
we discuss these risks in more detail in the critical accounting policies and estimates  capital resources  liquidity  and market risk exposures sections

fixed annuity premium sales variable annuity premium sales investment product sales average fixed policyholder fund balances average separate account policyholder fund balances average assets effective investment spreads for fixed annuities  including sfas adjustment fixed annuity surrenders as a percentage of beginning fund balances fixed annuity premium sales increased in versus as a result of increased acceptance in the marketplace of equity indexed annuities eias  which represented over three fourths of our aip sales in our fixed annuity premium sales were lower in reflecting competition in the fixed annuity market and our unwillingness to match our competitors crediting rates  which would have reduced our returns below acceptable levels  especially in the bank channel 
we continue to develop differentiated annuity products designed to create new distribution opportunities and strengthen existing marketing relationships 
profitability of eias is influenced by the management of derivatives to hedge the index performance of the policies 
these contracts permit the holder to elect an interest rate return or an equity market component  where interest credited to the contracts is linked to the performance of the s p index 
policyholders may elect to rebalance index options at renewal dates  either annually or biannually 
at each renewal date  we have the opportunity to re price the equity indexed component by establishing participation rates  subject to minimum guarantees 
we purchase options that are highly correlated to the portfolio allocation decisions of our policyholders  such that we are economically hedged with respect to equity returns for the current reset period 
the mark to market of the options we hold impacts investment income and interest credited in approximately equal and offsetting amounts 
this adjustment increased net investment income and interest credited by  and in  and with no net impact on reportable segment results 
however  statement of financial accounting standard  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  requires that we calculate the fair values of index options we will purchase in the future to hedge policyholder index allocations applicable to future reset periods 
these fair values represent an estimate of the cost of the options we will purchase in the future  discounted back to the date of the balance sheet  using current market indicators of volatility and interest rates 
changes in the fair values of these liabilities result in volatility that is reported in interest credited 
interest credited was decreased by in and in and increased in for these changes 
the notional amounts of policyholder fund balances allocated to the index options were at december  and at december  net investment income increased at a lower rate than the growth in average policyholder fund balances  due to a decline in investment yields offset somewhat by the options market value adjustment described above 
lower investment yields resulted from a decline in our base earned rate  due to the general interest rate environment  as well as a reduction in excess prepayments of mortgage backed securities and prepayments of commercial mortgage loans 
the effect of these prepayments in the aip segment increased effective yields by  and basis points in  and we actively manage spreads on fixed annuity products in response to changes in our investment portfolio yields by adjusting the interest rates we credit on annuity policyholder fund balances while considering our competitive strategies 
our newer product designs in aip require lower spreads to achieve targeted returns and require lower levels of capital to support new sales 
these factors  combined with the current interest rate environment  will likely result in earnings that lag behind growth in average fund balances for a period of time 
effective investment spreads on fixed annuities decreased in after having increased in  primarily due to the lower impact of excess prepayments discussed above 
our ability to manage interest crediting rates on fixed annuity products is limited by continued low general market interest rates  as the investment of cash flows at current interest rates reduces our average portfolio yield  and crediting rate actions are limited by minimum guaranteed rates provided in policyholder contracts 
we have approximately billion of fixed annuity policyholder fund balances with crediting rates that are reset on an annual basis  for which our crediting rates on average were approximately basis points in excess of minimum guaranteed rates at december  approximately billion of fixed annuity policyholder fund balances have multi year guaranteed rates myg  approximately of which will reset in with an additional billion resetting in and thereafter 
as multi year guarantees expire  policyholders will have the opportunity to renew their annuities at rates in effect at that time 
our ability to retain these annuities will be subject to then current competitive conditions 
the current average spread to the minimum underlying guarantee on these products is approximately basis points 
in  of fixed annuity policyholder fund balances reset  of which approximately lapsed where the holder did not select another product that we offer 
these lapses reduced policyholder fund balances and increased dac amortization  but also increased investment spreads for the business retained 
surrenders are affected by factors such as varying crediting rates on multi year guarantees compared to current crediting rates at reset dates and the absence of surrender charges at reset dates 
fixed annuity surrenders as a percentage of beginning fund balances increased in reflecting  in part  the surrender of annuities with expiring multi year crediting rate guarantees 
the increase in fixed annuity surrenders  other than resetting myg annuities  favorably impacted surrender charge revenues 
the surrender rate in the aip segment is influenced by many other factors such as the portion of the business that has low or no remaining surrender charges  competition from annuity products including those which pay up front interest rate bonuses or higher market rates  and rising interest rates that may make returns available on new annuities or investment products more attractive than our older annuities 
in addition to surrender charge protection against early surrender  we have added a market value adjustment mva to many of our new annuity products 
the mva provides some degree of protection from disintermediation in a rising interest rate environment 
fixed annuity fund balances subject to surrender charges of at least or an mva decreased to at year end from at year end  as strong sales of eias offset most of the decline in the existing inforce that is subject to surrender charges 
beginning with the first quarter of see note  net deferral and amortization of bonus interest is presented in policy benefits as a result of the adoption of a new accounting standard discussed above 
previously  it had been included as a component of dac and was included in insurance expenses 
excluding the net deferral for  policy benefits increased as growth in average fund balances and the market value adjustment of options were partially offset by crediting rate reductions 
policy benefits decreased in despite growth in average policyholder fund balances  reflecting crediting rate reductions 
total aip expenses including the net deferral and amortization of dac and voba were as follows favorable unfavorable vs

insurance companies commissions general and administrative acquisition related general and administrative maintenance related taxes  licenses and fees total commissions and expenses incurred less commissions and expenses capitalized amortization of dac and voba net expense insurance companies broker dealer commissions other net expense broker dealer net expense commissions  acquisition related general and administrative expenses and dac capitalization all increased with the strong sales increase over dac amortization increased partly due to true ups of  reflecting actual lapse experience of myg annuities and the impact of the favorable change in the fair value of eia option liabilities 
insurance companies net expenses also increased in as a result of the reclassification of the net deferral of bonus interest to policy benefits as discussed above 
broker dealer revenues and expenses increased commensurately due to the improved condition of equity markets and higher sales volumes 
in  amortization of dac and voba increased primarily due to growth in the business and a decrease in amortization in of due to lower lapse rates on fixed annuity products  partially offset by an increase in amortization on variable annuity products using the mean reversion techniques discussed in the critical accounting policies and estimates section 
risks in the annuity business are spread compression  increased lapses from maturity of myg annuities  increased lapses when interest rates rise  particularly in the portion of business subject to low or no surrender charges or mva  execution risk on eia hedges  changes in taxation of our products or products they might compete with  and competition from variable annuities or other financial services in an evolving market for investment products 
we discuss these risks in more detail in the critical accounting policies and estimates  capital resources  liquidity  and market risk exposures sections of this filing

the following table summarizes key information for benefit partners that we believe to be important drivers and indicators of our future profitability favorable unfavorable vs 
vs 
life  disability and dental annualized sales reportable segment results life disability dental other total loss ratios life disability dental combined total expenses as a of premium income average assets reportable segment results for benefit partners increased substantially in over  primarily due to approximately of after tax earnings from the acquired canada life business the canada life block  excluding of after tax borrowing costs related to the acquisition that are included in the corporate and other segment 
see note for further discussion of the canada life transaction 
total revenues for benefit partners increased over due to the acquisition of substantially all of the us based group life  disability and dental business of canada life and due to organic growth from sales during and excluding the canada life block  premiums and other considerations increased over due to strong growth in the disability business 
annualized sales increased over due to continued growth in our sales force in a continued strong competitive environment industry wide 
also  our sales results reflect the actions we implemented in  and continued in  in the life business to tighten certain underwriting rules and strengthen our sales focus on higher margin  smaller case business 
the increase in policy benefits in reflected growth from the acquired canada life business as well as strong organic growth in our existing business 
the combined loss ratio for of was in line with as adverse experience in our long term disability business from unfavorable experience in incidence rates and unfavorable claims termination experience offset favorable experience in our life business 
the increase in policy benefits in vs 
was driven by growth in overall business coupled with an increased loss ratio  primarily related to adverse mortality experience in our life business 
accordingly  we made pricing increases to address an isolated segment of our life business that was under performing  and we implemented greater management scrutiny of larger cases  especially renewals of groups with adverse experience 
these changes contributed to the improved loss ratio in our life business in expenses were as follows favorable unfavorable vs 
vs 
commissions general and administrative taxes  licenses and fees total commissions and expenses incurred less commissions and expenses capitalized amortization of dac total expense the expense growth in reflects expenses from canada life integration activities and overall growth in the business 
the increase in the total unit expense ratios for the year relative to the period is driven by the impact of these integration expenses as well as the decline in dac capitalization and growth in dac amortization expense on a unit expense basis as this block continues to grow 
in the first quarter  we also changed our presentation of commissions  which are paid and expensed on a monthly basis 
in the past  we reflected such commissions as capitalized and fully amortized each month 
we no longer flow these commissions through dac 
this change has no impact on total expenses or reportable segment results 
expense growth in was in line with the overall growth in the business 
in october  the office of the attorney general of the state of new york announced a lawsuit following a probe into two practices it had observed in the property and casualty insurance brokerage industry bid rigging and contingent commissions 
the company has not been named in any litigation or investigation and has not received any subpoenas with regard to such matters  though all insurance companies and brokers licensed in the states of new jersey  north carolina and nebraska were asked by the respective insurance commissioners within those states to provide certain information in the context of an industry fact finding investigation 
benefit partners has found no evidence of bid rigging 
we use broker bonus programs in our business development practices 
such bonuses are considered normal practice within the industry 
it is unclear at this time what  if any  changes in regulation may come about as a result of this matter  but the company has positioned its business practices to respond appropriately to any increase in required disclosure or other such change in business practices 
risks beyond normal competition that may impact this segment include increased morbidity risk due to a weak economy that may increase disability claim costs an industry wide phenomenon  continued medical cost inflation that can put pressure on non medical benefit premium rates because employers may focus more on the employer s cost of non medical programs  and mortality morbidity risks including concentration risks from acts of terrorism not priced for or reinsured 
we mitigate these risks by monitoring new and existing claims and industry health care trend reports which serve as indicators of increased employer medical costs  through scrutiny of larger cases  especially renewals of groups with adverse experience  and through intensive review of our concentration risks 
loss ratios in our disability business  which have been historically lower than industry averages  may increase toward industry averages as this business continues to grow 
in addition  continued declines in investment yields could pressure interest spreads on investments backing long term disability reserves and other long tail liabilities and could require us to lower the discount rate we use in establishing reserves 
we monitor these spreads carefully and evaluate any need to adjust assumptions based on the then current outlook for investment yield trends 
one of our non core products  exec u care  which provides an insured medical expense reimbursement vehicle to executives for non covered health plan costs  produced revenues for this segment of approximately and reportable segment results of approximately in a discontinuation of exec u care would have a significant impact on segment revenues  but only a limited effect on reportable segment results 
communications jpcc operates radio and television broadcast properties and produces syndicated sports programming 
reportable segment results for communications were as follows favorable unfavorable vs 
vs 
communications revenues net cost of sales operating expenses broadcast cash flow depreciation and amortization corporate general and administrative expenses net interest expense operating revenue before income taxes income taxes reportable segment results reportable segment results is a non gaap measure 
see note for further discussion 
communications revenues increased in from political advertising  increased market share in all of our radio and television markets and excellent sales results in our sports operations 
in  combined revenues for radio and television increased despite sluggish advertising growth in our radio markets 
typically  political advertising favorably impacts revenues in even numbered years 
excluding the impact of political revenues  revenues from television increased in and in revenues from sports operations increased in due to increased demand for both our football and basketball products  compared to an increase of in  which was driven primarily by football 
broadcast cash flow  a non gaap measure that is commonly used in the broadcast industry  is calculated as communications revenues less operating costs and expenses before depreciation and amortization 
broadcast cash flow increased in all businesses in and as a result of the increase in revenues combined with continued expense discipline 
cost of sales represents direct and variable costs  consisting primarily of sales commissions  rights fees and sports production costs 
operating expenses represent other costs to operate the broadcast properties  including salaries  marketing  research  purchased programming and station overhead costs 
total expenses  excluding interest expense  increased in and decreased in as a percent of communication revenues  these expenses were  and for  and the and improvements reflect growing revenues and continued expense discipline  partially offset in by increased sales commissions and bonuses 
on april   jpcc acquired the assets and an fcc license to broadcast a fm radio station in san diego  ca for radio and television stations require a license  subject to periodic renewal  from the fcc to operate 
while management considers the likelihood of a failure to renew remote  any station that fails to receive renewal would be forced to cease operations 
we currently have two television stations and five radio stations that are operating under expired licenses pending renewal  as allowed by the fcc 
the fcc is delaying all commercial broadcast license renewals in these states until all complaints against any commercial broadcast station in that state are resolved 
we are unaware of any complaints involving jp stations 
because our broadcasting businesses rely on advertising revenues  they are sensitive to cyclical changes in both the general economy and in the economic strength of local markets 
furthermore  our stations derived and of their advertising revenues from the automotive industry in and if automobile advertising is significantly curtailed  it could have a negative impact on broadcasting revenues 
in  of television revenues came from a network agreement with our cbs affiliated stations that expires in the trend in the industry is away from the networks compensating affiliates for carrying their programming  and there is a possibility those revenues will be eliminated when the contract is renewed 
many different businesses compete for available advertising sales in our markets  including newspapers  magazines  billboards and other radio and television broadcasters 
technological changes such as satellite radio and consolidation in the broadcast industry may increase competition for audiences and advertisers 
corporate and other the corporate and other segment includes the excess capital of the insurance subsidiaries  other corporate investments including defaulted securities  benefit plan net assets  goodwill related to insurance acquisitions  and corporate debt 
the reportable segment results primarily contain the earnings on the invested excess capital  interest expense related to the corporate debt  and operating expenses that are corporate in nature such as advertising and charitable and civic contributions 
all net realized capital gains and losses  which include other than temporary impairments of securities  are reported in this segment 
the following table summarizes results for this segment

see note for further discussion 
earnings on investments and other income increased in  driven primarily by an increase in default charges received from the operating segments  a settlement from a bank of america merger class action suit  and dividends related to equity securities  offset partially by the allocation of bond calls to our segments and lower portfolio yields 
default charges are received from the operating segments for this segment s assumption of all credit related losses on the invested assets of those segments 
these charges are calculated in part as a percentage of invested assets 
default charge income for  and was  and the increase in resulted from an increase in investment assets including those related to the canada life business and a change in fixed income securities asset mix 
default charges increased in in response to the credit environment experienced in the securities markets during recent years 
earnings on investments in this segment can fluctuate based upon opportunistic repurchases of common stock  the amount of excess capital generated by the operating segments and lost investment income on bonds defaulted or sold at a loss 
interest expense on debt increased in after remaining flat in and decreasing in the increase reflects a change in the mix of outstanding indebtedness between floating and fixed rate instruments and an increase in the overall level of outstanding indebtedness 
specifically  our fixed rate indebtedness increased with the issuance of of ten year notes on january  at an effective interest rate of  a portion of which was used to support the canada life acquisition see note 
see note for details of our debt structure and interest costs 
operating expenses declined in and  and expenses for included an accrual for litigation of operating expenses vary with the level of corporate activities and strategies 
effective tax rates improved in versus due to an increase in non taxable income and the dividends received deduction 
realized investment gains and losses were as follows stock gains stock losses stock losses from writedowns bond gains bond losses from sales bond losses from writedowns other gains and losses net total pretax gains losses dac amortization income taxes realized investment gains losses  net of taxes the realized investment gains in sharply contrasted with the realized investment losses in the two previous years 
the improvement was due to stock gains as well as the decline in bond impairments as a result of significant improvement in the corporate credit environment and proactive portfolio management 
the write downs primarily reflected further deterioration among airline issuers 
we reflect provisions for credit related losses in our estimated gross profits when calculating dac and voba amortization 
as reflected in the preceding table  we record dac amortization on realized gains and losses on investments that back ul type products 
modeling of expected gross profits related to dac and voba is discussed further in the critical accounting policies and estimates section 
the following table summarizes assets assigned to this segment 
vs 
parent company  passive investment companies and corporate line assets of insurance subsidiaries unrealized gain on fixed interest investments co insurance receivables on acquired blocks employee benefit plan assets goodwill arising from insurance acquisitions other total total assets for the corporate and other segment increased primarily as a result of the increase in unrealized gains on fixed interest investments as well as the increase in employee benefit plan assets 
we received a large policy loan repayment in the second quarter  reducing coinsurance receivables 
risks for this segment include investment impairments due to weakening in the economy  the risk of rising interest rates on our floating rate debt  our ability to replace existing debt agreements with comparable terms  declines in the dividends on or the values of our equity securities which would limit our potential for realized gains  general uncertainty regarding litigation  and the potential for future impairment of goodwill 
also  as discussed in the liquidity section  to service our debt and to pay shareholder dividends  we rely on excess cash flows through dividends from our subsidiaries 
dividends from our insurance subsidiaries depend upon regulatory approval when above certain limits 
capital resources our capital structure consists of year term notes  floating rate extendible liquidity securities exls  short term commercial paper  securities sold under repurchase agreements  junior subordinated debentures  and stockholders equity 
we also have a bank credit agreement  under which we have the option to borrow at various interest rates 
the agreement  as amended on may   aggregates  which is available until may the credit agreement principally supports our issuance of commercial paper 
outstanding commercial paper has various maturities that can be up to days 
if we cannot remarket commercial paper at maturity  we have sufficient liquidity  consisting of the bank credit agreements  liquid assets  such as equity securities  and other resources to retire these obligations 
the weighted average interest rates for commercial paper borrowings outstanding of and at december  and were and 
the maximum amount outstanding in  after the january issuance of the term debt and exls  was compared to in our commercial paper is currently rated by two rating agencies 
agency rating fitch f standard poor s a these are both the highest ratings that the agencies issue and were reaffirmed in a significant drop in these ratings  while not anticipated  could cause us to pay higher rates on commercial paper borrowings or lose access to the commercial paper market 
our insurance subsidiaries have sold collateralized mortgage obligations and agency debentures under repurchase agreements involving various counterparties  accounted for as financing arrangements with maturities less than six months 
we may use proceeds to purchase securities with longer durations as an asset liability management strategy 
at december  and  repurchase agreements  including accrued interest  were and the securities involved had a fair value and amortized cost of and at december  versus and at december  the maximum principal amounts outstanding were and during and the junior subordinated debentures were issued in and consist of at an interest rate of and at an interest rate of 
interest is paid semi annually 
these debentures mature in  but are redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the company beginning january   with two thirds subject to a call premium of and the remainder subject to a call premium of  each grading to zero as of january  in january  we issued of year term notes and of floating rate extendible liquidity securities exls that currently have a maturity of november  as of december   subject to periodic extension through each quarter  the holders must make an election to extend the maturity of the exls for months  otherwise they become due and payable on the next maturity date to which they had previously been extended 
the exls bear interest at libor plus a spread  which increases annually to a maximum of basis points 
the proceeds from the debt issuances were used to support the canada life acquisition and to pay down commercial paper while rebalancing the mix of fixed and floating rate debt and short and long term maturities in our capital structure 
we received confirmation from both fitch and s p that the debt issuance had no impact on our ratings or outlook 
we are considering the issuance of funding agreement backed notes  which would be secured by annuity contracts issued by one of our life insurance subsidiaries 
stockholders equity increased in compared to in unrealized gains on available for sale securities  which are included as a component of stockholders equity  increased and in those years 
the remaining change in stockholders equity reflects net income  dividends to stockholders  changes in the fair values of derivatives  changes in the minimum pension liability  and common share activity due to issuance of shares under our stock option plans and share repurchases 
our ratio of stockholders equity to assets excluding separate accounts was  and at december   and in we repurchased  of our common shares at an average cost of per share compared to  shares at an average cost of in at year end  we had authorization from our board to repurchase million additional shares 
our insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus and risk based capital levels well above current regulatory required levels 
as mentioned earlier  a significant portion of our life sales consists of products containing no lapse guarantees secondary guarantees  for which statutory reserving practices referred to as axxx are currently under review by the national association of insurance commissioners 
numerous proposals have been circulated by regulators and the industry and debate is ongoing 
certain approaches could require companies to hold additional statutory policy reserves 
our estimate of the potential impact on our year end statutory surplus under various approaches ranges from to this potential impact would grow annually  particularly with continued sales of products subject to these reserve requirements 
the proposals under consideration  if adopted in a manner that results in significantly increased statutory reserves  could cause the company and other insurers to increase pricing or otherwise limit availability of certain product offerings 
in december  we formed an insurance subsidiary  chartered in bermuda for the purpose of providing intracompany reinsurance 
in conjunction with the establishment of this subsidiary  we obtained a letter of credit facility  which will provide credit enhancement for our subsidiary s reinsurance obligations 
jp is a guarantor under the letter of credit facility 
at december   we had not reinsured any reserves subject to axxx 
we continue to review other strategic alternatives in the event that regulatory requirements ultimately result in provision of higher statutory reserves for our secondary guarantee products 
we cannot estimate the cost of potential alternative solutions 
our insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus and risk based capital levels well above regulatory required levels 
these capital levels together with the rating agencies assessments of our business strategies have enabled our major life insurance affiliates to attain the following financial strength ratings jp life jpfic jpla am best a a a standard poor s aaa aaa aaa fitch ratings aa aa aa the ratings by am best and standard poor s are currently the highest available by those rating agencies and have been reaffirmed in  while the ratings by fitch ratings is that agency s second highest rating 
a significant drop in our ratings  while not anticipated  could potentially impact future sales and or accelerate surrenders on our business in force 
liquidity we meet liquidity requirements primarily by positive cash flows from the operations of subsidiaries 
primary sources of cash from our insurance operations are premiums  other insurance considerations  receipts for policyholder accounts  investment sales and maturities and investment income 
primary uses of cash for our insurance operations include purchases of investments  payment of insurance benefits  operating expenses  withdrawals from policyholder accounts  costs related to acquiring new business  dividends and income taxes 
primary sources of cash from the communications operations are revenues from broadcast advertising  and primary uses include payments for commissions  compensation and related costs  sports rights  interest  income taxes and purchases of fixed assets 
we have the ability to generate adequate cash flows for operations on a short term basis and a long term basis 
net cash provided by operations in  and was  and the primary driver for the increase over related to the proceeds received in the canada life transaction  an increase in traditional premium receipts from organic growth in benefit partners  and lower federal income tax payments 
the increase in over was from an increase in traditional product premium receipts in our benefit partners segment due to growth in that segment  combined with the timing of the processing of community banks and boli single premiums received in late  pending policy issuance which then occurred in those premiums were reported as cash received from operations in and as a decrease in cash from operations in net cash used in investing activities was   and  in  and in  investment purchases increased substantially due to cash received in the canada life transaction and from higher sales of eias 
cash used in other investing activities increased due to purchases of affordable housing tax credit securities  higher originations of mortgages loans  and an acquisition of assets and an fcc license for a radio station 
the decrease in aip sales in provided less funds for investment purposes 
record sales levels in our individual products segment in increased funds available for investment 
net cash provided by financing activities was  and  in  and  including cash inflows from policyholder contract deposits net of withdrawals of   and  the fluctuations in net policyholder contract deposits reflect higher sales of eias offset by higher surrenders in and lower community bank life sales in compared to net borrowings increased in over largely due to the funding of the canada life acquisition 
in order to meet the parent company s dividend payments  debt servicing obligations and other expenses  we rely on dividends from our insurance subsidiaries 
cash dividends received from subsidiaries by the parent company were  and in  and our life insurance subsidiaries are subject to laws in their states of domicile that limit the amount of dividends that can be paid without the prior approval of the respective state s insurance regulator 
the limits are based in part on the prior year s statutory income and capital  which are negatively impacted by bond losses and write downs 
approval of these dividends will depend upon the circumstances at the time  but we have not experienced problems with state approvals in the past 
cash and cash equivalents were  and at december   and the parent company and non regulated subsidiaries held equity and fixed income securities of  and at these dates 
we consider the majority of these securities to be a source of liquidity to support our strategies 
total assets increased  in and  in due primarily to the canada life acquisition  net policyholder contract deposits  growth in dac  and growth in separate account assets  which more than offset dividends  stock repurchases and impairment losses 
total debt and equity securities available for sale at december  and were  and  gross unrealized gains and losses at december  were  and compared to gross unrealized gains and losses at december  of  and 
at december  and  we had reinsurance receivables of and and policy loans of and which are related to the businesses of jp financial that are coinsured with household international hi affiliates 
hi has provided payment  performance and capital maintenance guarantees with respect to the balances receivable 
we regularly evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk related to reinsurance activities 
we have not suffered any significant credit losses from reinsurance activities in the last three years 
contractual obligations the following table details our contractual obligations  including principal and interest where applicable  at december  the amounts in the table are different than those reported in our consolidated balance sheet at december  due to the consideration of interest in debt obligations and discounted estimates of future payments for policy liabilities excluding the impact of future premium revenues 
some of the figures we include in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties  and other factors 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the enforceable and legally binding obligations we will actually pay in future periods are likely to vary from those reflected in the table 
estimated payments due by period and after total commercial paper borrowings reverse repurchase agreements exls year term notes junior subordinated debentures purchase obligations total  excluding policy liabilities policy liabilities  discounted total contractual obligations external commercial paper and reverse repurchase agreements represent short term debts that are due in less than one year 
as discussed earlier  the floating rate exls at yearend had a maturity of november  subject to periodic extension through for purposes of this table  we have assumed these securities will be extended until and have calculated interest payments by applying the spreads defined in the agreement to year libor forward rates 
the payments for the year term notes are based on the amortization schedule included in the debt agreement 
the junior subordinated debentures mature in  or earlier at our option beginning in for purposes of this table  we have assumed the debentures remain outstanding until purchase obligations consist of jpcc commitments for purchases of syndicated television programming and commitments on other contracts and future sports programming rights 
in  jpcc announced an agreement in principle that will give jp sports and its broadcasting partner television syndication rights to atlantic coast conference football and basketball games through the season 
while the agreement is not yet final  we have estimated the amount of the future obligations that will be required under the present terms of the arrangement 
purchase obligations represent as of december   payable through the year we have commitments to sell a portion of those sports programming rights to other entities for over the same period 
these commitments are not reflected as an asset or liability in our balance sheets because the programs are not currently available for use 
we expect advertising revenues that are sold on an annual basis to fund the purchase commitments 
our total policy liabilities also represent contractual obligations  where the timing of payments is uncertain because it depends on insurable events or policyholder surrenders 
our asset liability management process  discussed further in market risk exposures  is designed to appropriately match our invested assets with the actuarially estimated timing of amounts payable to our policyholders 
we have included an estimate as to the timing of the payment of these obligations in the table above  assuming a level interest rate scenario 
the amounts presented were discounted over a year period using an interest rate of 
off balance sheet arrangements and commitments we have no material off balance sheet arrangements of a financing nature 
we routinely enter into commitments to extend credit in the form of mortgage loans and to purchase certain debt instruments in private placement transactions for our investment portfolio 
the fair value of such outstanding commitments as of december  approximates these commitments will be funded through cash flows from operations and investment maturities during and are not included in contractual obligations listed above 
investments portfolio description our strategy for managing the investment portfolio of our insurance subsidiaries is to consistently meet pricing assumptions while appropriately managing credit risk 
we invest for the long term  and most of our investments are held until they mature 
our investment portfolio includes primarily fixed income securities and commercial mortgage loans 
the nature and quality of investments that our insurance subsidiaries hold must comply with state regulatory requirements 
we have established a formal investment policy  which describes our overall quality and diversification objectives and limits 
approximately of our securities portfolio has been designated as available for sale afs and is carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
we determine fair values of our securities  including securities not actively traded  using the methodology described in the critical accounting policies and estimates section above 
changes in fair values of afs securities are reflected in other comprehensive income 
the remainder of our securities portfolio has been designated as held to maturity htm 
as prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles  htm securities are carried at amortized cost  and accordingly there is a difference between fair value and carrying value for htm securities 
the following table shows the carrying values of our invested assets

these unrealized gains and losses do not necessarily represent future gains or losses that will be realized 
changing conditions related to specific bonds  overall market interest rates  credit spreads or equity securities markets as well as general portfolio management decisions are likely to impact values we ultimately realize

we manage this risk through a structured approach in which we assess the effects of the changing economic landscape 
we devote a significant amount of effort of both highly specialized  well trained internal resources and external experts in our approach to managing credit risk 
impairment review in identifying potentially distressed securities  we first screen for all securities that have a fair value to amortized cost ratio of less than 
however  as part of this identification process  management must make assumptions and judgments using the following information current fair value of the security compared to amortized cost length of time the fair value was below amortized cost industry factors or conditions related to a geographic area that are negatively affecting the security downgrades by a rating agency past due interest or principal payments or other violation of covenants deterioration of the overall financial condition of the specific issuer in analyzing securities for other than temporary impairments  we then pay special attention to securities that have been potentially distressed for a period greater than six months 
we assume that  absent reliable contradictory evidence  a security that is potentially distressed for a continuous period greater than twelve months has incurred an other than temporary impairment 
such reliable contradictory evidence might include  among other factors  a liquidation analysis performed by our investment professionals and consultants  improving financial performance or valuation of underlying assets specifically pledged to support the credit 
when we identify a security as potentially impaired  we add it to our potentially distressed security list and determine if the impairment is other than temporary 
various committees comprised of senior management and investment analysts intensively review the potentially distressed security list to determine if a security is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
in this review  we consider the following criteria fundamental analysis of the liquidity and financial condition of the specific issuer underlying valuation of assets specifically pledged to support the credit time period in which the fair value has been significantly below amortized cost industry sector or geographic area applicable to the specific issuer our ability and intent to retain the investment for a sufficient time to recover its value when this intensive review determines that the decline is other than temporary based on management s judgment  the security is written down to fair value through a charge to realized investment gains and losses 
we adjust the amortized cost for both afs and htm securities that have experienced other than temporary impairments to reflect fair value at the time of the impairment 
we consider factors that lead to an other than temporary impairment of a particular security in order to determine whether these conditions have impacted other similar securities 
we monitor unrealized losses through further analysis according to maturity date  credit quality  individual creditor exposure and the length of time the individual security has continuously been in an unrealized loss position 
the following table shows the maturity date distribution of our debt securities in an unrealized loss position at december  the fair values of these securities could fluctuate over the respective periods to maturity or any sale

securities with unrealized gains and losses will fluctuate  as will those securities that we have identified as potentially distressed 
we consider all of the factors discussed earlier when we determine if an unrealized loss is other than temporary  including our ability and intent to hold the security until the value recovers 
however  we may subsequently identify securities for which we no longer have a positive intent and ability to hold until forecasted recovery 
this determination may be made due to a change in facts and circumstances regarding the specific investments 
at such time  we will write down the security to fair value to recognize any unrealized losses 
realized losses write downs and sales realized losses are comprised of both write downs on other than temporary impairments and actual sales of securities 
in we had other than temporary impairments on securities of as compared to for the individual impairments in excess of  how they were measured  the circumstances giving rise to the losses  and the impact those circumstances have on other material investments we held at the time are as follows write down on debt of a commercial cable equipment company  due to a likely bankruptcy filing following an adverse judicial ruling on a summary judgment motion 
the value of assets may not exceed the cost of a bankruptcy filing or the costs of winding down the operations 
this had no impact on other holdings in our portfolio 
write down on debt of a national passenger airline  due to high labor costs  increasing fuel prices  intense competition from low cost carriers  an inablility to access capital  and the lack of demand for older aircraft 
we have been actively managing all of our exposures to the passenger airline industry  although this had no impact on other holdings in our portfolio 
write down on debt of dairy holdings a subsidiary of parmalat 
this issuer defaulted on this security and subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection 
this is the only exposure we had to parmalat 
this security was sold for its written down value in this had no impact on other holdings in our portfolio 
write down related to airline equipment trusts that were secured by passenger aircraft 
given the overall softness in the us passenger airline industry  these securities became other than temporarily impaired 
we sold these bonds at their book value after this write down 
we have been actively managing all of our exposures to the passenger airline industry  although this had no impact on other holdings in our portfolio 
write down of us generating 
this was an investment in a project finance security in the power generating industry 
the lessee of this facility filed bankruptcy and rejected this lease 
as a result  the investment became other than temporarily impaired 
this had no impact on other holdings in our portfolio 
write down on preferred stock of a financial marketing firm 
the circumstances surrounding this other than temporary impairment do not impact any other securities in our portfolio 
in we incurred losses of on sales of securities 
there were no individually material losses on sales of securities in after consideration of all available evidence  none of these disposals previously met the criteria for other than temporary impairment 
the company will continue to manage its afs portfolio in a manner that is consistent with the available for sale classification 
mortgage backed securities mortgage backed securities including commercial mortgage backed securities at december  and all of which are included in debt securities available for sale  were as follows federal agency issued mortgage backed securities corporate private labeled mortgage backed securities total our investment strategy with respect to mortgage backed securities mbs portfolio focuses on actively traded issues with less volatile cash flows 
the majority of the mbs holdings are sequential and planned amortization class tranches of federal agency issuers 
the mbs portfolio has been constructed with underlying mortgage collateral characteristics and structure in order to mitigate cash flow volatility over a range of interest rates 
because of the decline in interest rates during the early months of  the mortgage market experienced record levels of refinancings and the structural protection of our mbs portfolio eroded 
we experienced mbs prepayments totaling  or and  or of the average carrying value of the mbs portfolio in and our mbs portfolio is primarily a discount portfolio  therefore  prepayments accelerate the accretion of discount into income 
the excess accretion of discount increased investment income  and in  and these prepayments are reinvested at yields that are lower than our current portfolio yields  producing less investment income going forward 
our mbs portfolio declined significantly in and  and we reinvested most of the proceeds in investment grade corporate bonds 
mortgage loans we record mortgage loans on real property net of an allowance for credit losses 
this allowance includes both reserve amounts for specific loans  and a general reserve that is calculated by review of historical industry loan loss statistics 
we consider future cash flows and the probability of payment when we calculate our specific loan loss reserve 
prepayments on mortgage loans result from sales of the related properties or loan refinancings 
prepayments on mortgage loans were  and in  and  and proceeds were reinvested at lower yields 
see note for more detail regarding the composition and concentration of our mortgage loan portfolio 
derivative instruments our investment guidelines permit use of derivative financial instruments such as futures contracts and interest rate swaps in conjunction with specific direct investments 
our actual use of derivatives through december  has been limited to managing well defined interest rate risks 
interest rate swaps utilized in our asset liability management strategy with a current notional value of and were open as of december  and during  we began using interest rate swaps to hedge prospective bond purchases to back deposits on certain annuity contracts 
this hedging strategy protects the spread between the annuity crediting rate offered at the time the annuities are sold and the yield on bonds to be purchased to back those annuity contracts 
these interest rate swap contracts are generally terminated within a month 
we also purchase s p index options in conjunction with our sales of equity indexed annuities 
market risk exposures since our assets and liabilities are largely monetary in nature  our financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates at varying maturities  changes in spreads over us treasuries on new investment opportunities  changes in the yield curve  and equity price risks 
in  the average daily rate for the year us treasury increased basis points to as compared to in in a falling interest rate environment  the risk of prepayment on some fixed income securities increases and funds prepaid are then reinvested at lower yields 
we limit this risk by concentrating the fixed income portfolio mainly on non callable securities  by purchasing securities that provide for make whole type prepayment fees 
falling interest rates can also impact demand for our products  as interest bearing investments with no surrender charges and higher average returns from equity markets may become more attractive to new and existing customers 
conversely  in a rising interest rate environment  competitive pressures may make it difficult for us to sustain spreads between rates we credit on interest sensitive products and our portfolio earnings rates  thereby prompting withdrawals by policyholders 
we manage these risks by adjusting our interest crediting rates with due regard to the yield of our investment portfolio  minimum rate guarantees and pricing assumptions and by prudently managing interest rate risk of assets and liabilities 
while a modest interest rate increase would initially be unfavorable to our earnings  due to the near term impact on our cost of borrowing  such an increase would be favorable to our earnings over a longer timeframe as higher investment yields would be incorporated into our investment portfolio and our interest spreads 
conversely  a sustained period of flat to declining new money rates would reduce reported earnings due to the effect of minimum rate guarantees and the possible impact of increased lapsation in our insurance products 
as is typical in the industry  our life and annuity products contain minimum rate guarantees regarding interest we credit 
for interest sensitive life products  our minimum rates range from to  with an approximate weighted average of 
for annuity products  our minimum rates range from to  with an approximate weighted average of 
we employ various methodologies to manage our exposure to interest rate risks 
our asset liability management process focuses primarily on the management of interest rate risk of our insurance operations 
we monitor the duration of insurance liabilities compared to the duration of assets backing the insurance lines  measuring the optionality of cash flows 
our goal in this analysis is to prudently balance profitability and risk for each insurance product category  and for us as a whole 
at both december  and  of policy liabilities related to interest sensitive portfolios 
we also consider the timing of cash flows arising from market risk sensitive instruments and insurance portfolios under varying interest rate scenarios as well as the related impact on reported earnings under those varying scenarios 
market risk sensitive instruments include debt and equity securities available for sale and held to maturity including mbs securities  mortgage loans  policy loans  investment commitments  annuities in the accumulation phase and periodic payment annuities  commercial paper borrowings  repurchase agreements  notes payable and interest rate swaps 
we have derived the estimated incremental loss amounts below by modeling estimated cash flows of our market risk sensitive instruments and insurance portfolios 
incremental income or loss is net of taxes at 
the model also assumes that all floating rate debt  including reverse repurchase agreements  is replaced with similar instruments 
estimated cash flows produced in the model assume reinvestments representative of our current investment strategy  and calls prepayments include scheduled maturities as well as those expected to occur when borrowers can benefit financially based on the difference between prepayment penalties and new money rates under each scenario 
assumed lapse rates within insurance portfolios consider the relationships expected between crediting rates and market interest rates  as well as the level of surrender charges inherent in individual contracts 
the illustrated incremental income or loss also includes the expected impact of true up adjustments to amortization of dac  voba  and unearned revenue reserves but excludes the potential impact of unlocking adjustments 
the model is based on our existing business in force as of december  and does not consider new sales of life and annuity products or the potential impact of interest rate fluctuations on sales 
the following table shows our estimate of the impact that various hypothetical interest rate scenarios would have on our earnings for a single year  based on the assumptions in our model 
we believe that  based upon historically low current interest rates  a symmetrical change in interest rates is not reasonably possible 
our model shows the effect on income with an increase of up to basis points and a decrease of basis points 
we believe that the basis point increase or basis point decrease  graded pro rata over four quarters  reflects reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates as of december  we have also provided the estimated earnings impact for a single year assuming the interest rate changes occur instantaneously 
the incremental loss for a year derives primarily from differences in the yield curves and in the sensitivities they introduce to our model 
these estimated impacts are incremental to potential earnings impacts from trends and or environmental factors already in existence  such as a reduction in the level of prepayments on mortgage backed securities or the increased lapsation in our annuity business 
the model assumes that changes in our crediting rates will occur correspondingly with increases or declines in investment yields  subject to the impact of minimum rate guarantees 
as discussed previously  as of year end our crediting rates on blocks of business that are on an annual reset basis were approximately basis points and basis points on average in excess of minimum guaranteed rates for individual products and aip 
the table reflects the effect of the interest rate scenarios on one year s reportable segment results  excluding the impact of potential unlockings that are illustrated in a sensitivity analysis within the critical accounting policies and estimates section 
a spike in interest rates of basis points that lasts for three years would produce a significantly larger estimated loss in the second and third years  as policyholders would potentially seek more attractive rates elsewhere 
correspondingly  a basis point decrease would cause a significantly larger estimated loss in the second and third years  as minimum rate guarantees would prohibit us from lowering crediting rates on most products 
estimated incremental single year gain loss based on change in interest rate graded quarterly shift instantaneous shift basis points basis points basis points basis points generally  an increase in interest rates will benefit our earnings in the insurance portfolio  yet increase our interest expense on floating rate debt 
conversely  a decrease in interest rates will decrease earnings from the insurance portfolio as minimum rate guarantees have more of an effect and or competitive conditions would not permit us to reduce crediting rates  while we would benefit from the decline in interest expense on our floating rate debt 
the incremental income or loss for shifts in excess of those shown does not have a linear relationship to the values shown above 
the incremental loss resulting from a higher change in interest rates would be proportionally greater due to the optionality of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
similarly  the effect of minimum rate guarantees in our interest sensitive liabilities would compound the negative impact on the incremental gain loss  resulting from a greater decrease in interest rates 
a significant change in the slope of the yield curve could also affect our results 
for example  competing products such as bank cds could become relatively more attractive than our longer duration annuities under an inverted yield curve  resulting in higher policyholder withdrawals 
we are exposed to equity price risk on our equity securities other than trading 
we hold common stock with a fair value of  approximately is in a single issuer  bank of america corporation bankamerica 
we believe that a hypothetical decline in the equity market is possible 
if the market value of the s p index  and of bankamerica common stock specifically  decreased  the fair value of our common stock as of december  would change as follows hypothetical change in fair value from market decline bankamerica common stock other equity securities total change in fair values certain fixed interest rate market risk sensitive instruments may not give rise to incremental income or loss during the period illustrated  but may be subject to changes in fair values which are reflected in equity 
note presents additional disclosures concerning fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities 
external trends and forward looking information we operate within the united states financial services and broadcasting markets  which are both subject to general economic conditions 
interest rates on longer maturity debt instruments stabilized and rebounded slightly in after dropping dramatically in and additional changes in rates may affect our businesses in many ways as discussed earlier in the market risk exposure section 
as noted in the investments section  the prolonged decline in general economic conditions experienced in recent years increased our credit risk resulting in higher levels of impairments 
a prolonged period of further declining or even level interest rates would have an adverse impact on our individual and aip segments 
investments purchased for those segments yielding rates lower than our current portfolio yields will lower our overall portfolio earned rates 
in the individual and aip segments  there are minimum crediting rates on policyholder accounts inherent in the insurance portfolio due to both product guarantees and various state requirements 
our inability to reduce crediting rates in response to the declines in earned rates would result in a significant negative impact on future earnings 
furthermore  a continued general economic weakness would cause deterioration in our balance sheet and our overall future profitability 
our operations are also affected over the longer term by demographic shifts  global markets  technological innovation and overall capital market volatility 
these forces impact us in various ways such as demand for our insurance products and advertising revenues  competition from other financial services providers  competition from emerging technologies for television and radio advertising  competition for new investments  debt costs  mergers and consolidations within the financial services and communications sectors  and costs inherent in administering complex financial products 
demographic changes include the aging of the baby boomers  reaching their high earning years at a time when investment yields from fixed rate products are at historically low points 
this challenge has been met by the insurance industry by offering various types of fixed and variable products aimed at this population 
the industry s overall individual life insurance sales in the us were flat in and  until late in the year  reflected a trend towards those financial products with a fixed rate given the volatility in the equity markets 
regulatory and legal environment the us insurance industry has experienced mergers  acquisitions  consolidations  sales of business lines and marketing arrangements with other financial services providers 
these activities have been driven by a need to reduce costs of distribution and to increase economies of scale in the face of growing competition from larger insurers  banks  securities brokers  mutual funds and other non traditional competitors 
we expect further strategic alignments in the financial services industry given changing demographics  technological advances  and customer expectations for one stop shopping 
we continue to analyze our options within this environment for increasing distribution  adding products and technology and improving economies of scale 
state guaranty associations make assessments to cover losses to policyholders of insolvent or rehabilitated insurance companies 
assessments may be partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes in most states 
we have accrued for expected assessments net of estimated future premium tax deductions
