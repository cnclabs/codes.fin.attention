item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information about the results of operations  financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources of east west bancorp  inc and its subsidiaries  or the company 
this information is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to our financial condition and the results of our operations 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere herein 
information related to share volume and per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the two for one stock split that became effective on or about june  critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general practices within the banking industry 
the financial information contained within these statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
all our significant accounting principles are described in note of our consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein and are essential to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
some of our accounting principles require significant judgment to estimate values of either assets or liabilities 
in addition  certain accounting principles require significant judgment in applying complex accounting principles to individual transactions to determine the most appropriate treatment 
we have established procedures and processes to facilitate making the judgments necessary to prepare financial statements 
the following is a summary of the more judgmental and complex accounting estimates and principles 
in each area  we have identified the variables most important in the estimation process 
we have used the best information available to make the estimations necessary to value the related assets and liabilities 
actual performance that differs from our estimates and future changes in the key variables could change future valuations and impact net income 
investment securities the classification and accounting for investment securities are discussed in detail in note of the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  investment securities generally must be classified as held to maturity  available for sale or trading 
the appropriate classification is based partially on our ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on management s intentions with respect to either holding or selling the securities 
the classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities 
unrealized gains and losses on trading securities flow directly through earnings during the periods in which they arise  whereas for available for sale securities  they are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated comprehensive other income or loss and do not affect earnings until realized 
the fair values of our investment securities are generally determined by reference to quoted market prices and reliable independent sources 
we are obligated to assess  at each reporting date  whether there is an other than temporary impairment to our investment securities 
such impairment must be recognized in current earnings rather than in other comprehensive income 
aside from the freddie mac preferred stock that was determined to be impaired and written down during the second quarter of  we did not have any other investment securities that were deemed to be other than temporarily impaired as of december  investment securities are discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
allowance for loan losses our allowance for loan loss methodologies incorporate a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative  in establishing an allowance for loan loss that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date 
quantitative factors include our historical loss experience  delinquency and charge off trends  collateral values  changes in nonperforming loans  and other factors 
quantitative factors also incorporate known information about individual loans  including borrowers sensitivity to interest rate movements and borrowers sensitivity to quantifiable external factors including commodity and finished good prices as well as acts of nature earthquakes  floods  fires  etc 
that occur in a particular period 
qualitative factors include the general economic environment in our markets and  in particular  the state of certain industries 
size and complexity of individual credits  loan structure  extent and nature of waivers of existing loan policies and pace of portfolio growth are other qualitative factors that are considered in our methodologies 
as we add new products  increase the complexity of our loan portfolio  and expand our geographic coverage  we will enhance our methodologies to keep pace with the size and complexity of the loan portfolio 
changes in any of the above factors could have significant impact to the loan loss calculation 
we believe that our methodologies continue to be appropriate given our size and level of complexity 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere herein including the section loans and allowance for loan losses 
loan sales we routinely sell  and occasionally securitize  residential mortgage loans to secondary market investors 
when mortgage loans are sold  we generally retain the right to service these loans and we may retain residual and other interests  which are considered retained interests in the sold or securitized loans 
the gain on sale recorded on these loans depends  in part  on our allocation of the previous carrying amount of the loans to the retained interests 
previous carrying amounts are allocated in proportion to the relative fair values of the loans sold and the interests retained 
the fair values of retained interests are estimated based upon the present value of the associated expected future cash flows taking into consideration future prepayment rates  discount rates  expected credit losses  and other factors that impact the value of the retained interests 
we may also record mortgage servicing assets msa when the benefits of servicing are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer 
the company determines whether the benefits of servicing are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer by discounting all of the future net cash flows associated with the contractual rights and obligations of the servicing agreement 
the expected future net cash flows are discounted at a rate equal to the return that would adequately compensate a substitute servicer for performing the servicing 
in addition to the anticipated rate of loan prepayments and discount rates  other assumptions such as the cost to service the underlying loans  foreclosure costs  ancillary income and float rates are also used in determining the value of the msas 
mortgage servicing assets are discussed in more detail in notes and to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
accrued income taxes we estimate tax expense based on the amount we expect to owe various tax authorities 
taxes are discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued taxes  we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax position 
overview we achieved our eighth consecutive year of record earnings and growth during net income for the year totaled million  or on a per diluted share basis  a increase from the million  or per diluted share  earned during our earnings performance is attributable to a significant increase in net interest income resulting from continued strong loan growth as well as continued operating efficiencies and solid asset quality 
our return on average assets in was  compared to in and return on average equity was in  compared to in management expects net income per diluted common share for to be approximately to higher than in based on a projected loan growth of to and deposit growth of approximately to 
our earnings projection for also assumes a stable interest rate environment and continued operating efficiency 
one of the highlights of was the approval by the company s board of directors of a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend 
shareholders of record at the close of business on june  received one additional share of common stock for each share of common stock held by them on that date 
the additional stock was distributed to shareholders of record on june  another major highlight during the year was the completion of the trust bancorp acquisition in august in an all stock transaction valued at million 
trust bancorp is the parent company of trust bank which was founded in and offered community banking services to both retail and commercial customers through four branches located in the greater los angeles area 
as of the acquisition date  trust bank had total assets of million  loans of million and total deposits of million 
we were able to successfully integrate all of trust bank s systems into our infrastructure shortly after the closing of the transaction 
the acquisition also added over  deposit customers to our existing customer base  generating additional lending and deposit opportunities for the company 
total noninterest income decreased to million during  compared to the million earned during this decline is primarily attributable to a decrease in income from secondary marketing activities of to million in  from million in as a result of increases in interest rates by the federal reserve  we have seen a marked shift in loan origination activity from fixed rate mortgages to adjustable rate mortgages 
as we typically sell fixed rate mortgage loans in the secondary market and retain the adjustable rate mortgage loans in our portfolio  we decreased our overall secondary market activity in  as compared to partially offsetting this decrease in secondary marketing revenues during was a million net gain on sale of fixed assets  compared to a net loss of thousand during the net gain on sale of fixed assets can be predominantly attributed to the sale of three buildings previously owned by the company 
as a result of our continued expansion during  total noninterest expense increased to million in  compared with million for the prior year 
this increase is primarily driven by a increase in compensation and employee benefits and an increase in occupancy expenses 
the addition of several relationship and operational personnel during late and throughout to enhance and support our loan and deposit growth was the primary catalyst for the increase in compensation expense 
the addition of four branches and personnel from trust bank further contributed to higher compensation and occupancy expenses during despite the increase in overall expenses  our efficiency ratio  which represents noninterest expense excluding the amortization of intangibles and investments in affordable housing partnerships divided by the aggregate of net interest income before provision for loan losses and noninterest income  decreased to during  compared to during we believe this to be a reflection of our ability to efficiently and effectively utilize our resources and operating platform to support our continuing growth 
due to the overall growth of the bank and the scheduled relocation of our corporate headquarters  we anticipate noninterest expenses for to increase by to  but expect our efficiency ratio to remain in the to range 
total consolidated assets at december  increased to billion  compared with billion at december  a growth in gross loans was the primary driver of this increase 
excluding the impact of the trust bank acquisition  organic loan growth was during we attribute overall loan growth to the expansion of relationships throughout california  the addition of seasoned and skilled banking professionals  the attractiveness of a number of our loan programs and increased loan origination volume from our branch network 
we estimate loan growth in to be to  reflecting the core rate of growth in the bank s lending markets  the addition of new client relationships  and the utilization of additional lending programs and products 
total average assets increased to billion in  compared to billion in  due primarily to average loan growth 
total average loans grew to billion during  an increase of over the prior year 
year over year average loan growth was driven largely by increases in residential multifamily and commercial real estate loans 
total average deposits rose during to billion  compared to billion in almost all deposit categories experienced double digit gains during  with the most significant contributions coming from time  money market and noninterest bearing demand deposits 
the growth in time deposits is due to the introduction of various new products and promotions during the year while the growth in core deposits can be attributed to the bank s efforts to expand its small and mid sized commercial customer base through innovative programs at the retail branches that better fulfill the needs of these customers 
net interest income increased to million during  compared with million during the increase in net interest income is predominantly due to the significant loan growth experienced during partially offset by fairly robust increases in time deposits and fhlb advances 
despite steady increases in interest rates by the federal reserve during the second half of  our net interest margin decreased slightly to during  from during  primarily due to a substantial increase in average earning assets which grew during assuming a stable interest rate environment during  we anticipate the net interest margin for to be in the range of to 
total nonperforming assets were million  or of total assets at december   compared with million  or of total assets  at december  the allowance for loan losses totaled million at december   or of outstanding total loans 
net loan chargeoffs totaled million  or of average loans  during  compared with million  or of average loans  during we anticipate our overall asset quality to remain sound throughout we project that nonperforming assets will continue to be below of total assets and that net chargeoffs will remain below of average loans in we continue to be well capitalized under all regulatory guidelines with a tier i risk based capital ratio of  a total risk based capital ratio of  and a tier i leverage ratio of at december  during  we raised million in additional regulatory capital through the issuance of trust preferred securities in two separate trust preferred offerings 
trust preferred securities currently qualify as tier i capital for regulatory purposes 
we also completed a private placement of common stock with two institutional investors amounting to approximately million in march in addition  these investors exercised their option to purchase additional shares of the company s common stock amounting to million during august the net proceeds from the trust preferred offerings and private placement transactions were used for general corporate purposes  including support for the continued growth of the bank 
results of operations net income for totaled million  compared with million for and million for  representing an increase of for and for on a per diluted share basis  net income was  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in net earnings during is attributable to significantly higher net interest income  partially offset by higher provision for loan losses  operating expenses and provision for income taxes 
earnings in improved over due to higher net interest income and noninterest related revenues and lower provision for loan losses  partially offset by higher operating expenses and provision for income taxes 
our return on average total assets declined to in  compared to in and in  while the return on average stockholders equity declined to in  compared with in and in the lower return on average total assets in  as compared to prior years  can be attributed to the increase in average total assets primarily due to loan growth 
similarly  the decrease in average stockholders equity in  in comparison to prior years  is due to a higher level of average stockholders equity arising from increased retained earnings  as well as additional issuances of common stock pursuant to private placement transactions  the employee stock purchase plan  and stock option and warrant exercises 
table components of net income in millions net interest income provision for loan losses noninterest income noninterest expense provision for income taxes cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income return on average total assets return on average stockholders equity net interest income our primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on loans  investment securities and other earning assets less the interest expense on deposits  borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income in totaled million  a increase over net interest income of million in total interest and dividend income during increased to million compared with million during primarily due to a growth in average earning assets  partially offset by lower yields on all categories of earning assets 
the net growth in average earning assets was fueled by a growth in average loans  which increased to billion in  from billion in increases in all deposit categories and fhlb advances funded the growth in average earning assets 
total interest expense during increased to million compared with million a year ago 
this increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to the higher volume of average fhlb advances  time deposit and money market accounts  and junior subordinated debt during these volume increases are partially offset by lower rates paid on time deposits  fhlb advances  and junior subordinated debt 
net interest margin  defined as taxable equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets  remained relatively stable  decreasing basis points to during  from during the overall yield on earning assets increased basis points to in  from in  due to federal reserve interest rate increases during the second half of as well as loans comprising a larger percentage of average earning assets in relative to similarly  our overall cost of funds in increased by basis points to in response to the increasing interest rate environment  compared to for to facilitate the funding of our significant loan growth during  we increased our utilization of fhlb advances and time deposits  which contributed to the overall increase in our cost of funds for the year 
notwithstanding our increased utilization of fhlb advances and time deposits to fund our substantial loan growth during  we continue to rely heavily on noninterest bearing demand deposits as a significant funding source  with average noninterest bearing demand deposits increasing to million during  compared with million during comparing to  our net interest margin increased basis points to in  compared to in due to the disproportionate impact of lower interest rates on our overall yields compared to our overall cost of funds 
in  our overall yield on earning assets decreased basis points to  from in  due to federal reserve interest rate cuts  while our overall cost of funds decreased basis points to  from during  in response to the declining interest rate environment 
the steady downward repricing of our time deposit portfolio accounted for the majority of the reduction in our cost of funds during the following table presents the net interest spread  net interest margin  average balances  interest income and expense  and the average yields and rates by asset and liability component for the years ended december   and table summary of selected financial data year ended december  average average average average yield average yield average yield balance interest rate balance interest rate balance interest rate dolla rs in thousands assets interest earning assets short term investments   investment securities    loans receivable    fhlb and frb stock    total interest earning assets    noninterest earning assets cash and due from banks   allowance for loan losses   other assets   total assets   liabilities and stockholders equity interest bearing liabilities checking accounts    money market accounts    savings deposits   time deposits    short term borrowings   fhlb advances    junior subordinated debt    total interest bearing liabilities    noninterest bearing liabilities demand deposits   other liabilities   stockholders equity   total liabilities and stockholders equity   interest rate spread net interest income and net interest margin  includes amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on investment securities and loans receivable totaling million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

analysis of changes in net interest margin changes in our net interest income are a function of changes in rates and volumes of both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table sets forth information regarding changes in interest income and interest expense for the years indicated 
the total change for each category of interest earning asset and interest bearing liability is segmented into the change attributable to variations in volume changes in volume multiplied by old rate and the change attributable to variations in interest rates changes in rates multiplied by old volume

noninterest income decreased to million during from million in the prior year primarily due to lower income from secondary market activities  which decreased to million in from million in the decrease in secondary marketing income is influenced  in large part  by the current interest rate environment which has been subject to several rate increases by the federal reserve since the beginning of the third quarter of the rising rate environment favors the origination of variable rate and hybrid loans that we retain in our portfolio over fixed rate loans that we sell into the secondary market 
if interest rates continue to rise  we anticipate an even greater contraction in revenues earned from secondary market activities in partially offsetting this decrease in secondary market income were non recurring net gains on disposals of fixed assets amounting to million in  resulting from the sale of three office buildings including two corporate offices located in san marino  california 
the corporate offices were sold due to a scheduled relocation to pasadena  california sometime in the third quarter of in comparison the net loss on disposals of fixed assets totaled thousand during letters of credit fees and commissions  which represent revenues from trade finance operations as well as fees related to the issuance and maintenance of standby letters of credit  increased to million in  from million in the increase in letters of credit fees and commissions is due to a increase in the volume of trade finance transactions during as well as higher maintenance fees related to additional issuances of standby letters of credit during branch fees  which represent revenues derived from branch operations  amounted to million in  a decrease from the million earned in although there was a significant increase in the volume of deposits from to  we did not see a corresponding increase in revenues from service charges assessed to customers due to decreased fee structures and waived fees resulting primarily from competitive market pressures 
specifically  in  as compared to the prior year  we experienced a decrease in analysis charges on commercial deposit accounts and we waived fees on certain deposit products 
ancillary loan fees consist of charges related to the origination and closing of loans and revenues earned from the servicing of mortgages 
ancillary loan fees increased to million in  compared to million in  primarily due to a significant increase in loan origination volume during net gain on investment securities available for sale totaled million in  compared to million in during  we sold available for sale securities with a net carrying value of million compared to million in investment securities sold during reflected in the net gain on investment securities during was a thousand impairment writedown on a freddie mac preferred stock that we recorded in the second quarter of excluding this impairment writedown  total gain on sales of investment securities available for sale totaled million during sales of investment securities during provided additional liquidity to sustain the increase in loan production activity during the year  and served to replace the lower yields on investment securities with higher yields on loans 
income earned on bank owned life insurance policies decreased to million in from million in the decrease in income earned from life insurance policies is primarily due to lower overall interest rates paid on the company s existing policies relative to the prior year 
the company did not purchase any new life insurance contracts during at december   the aggregate cash surrender value of the company s life insurance policies amounted to million compared to million at december  the net increase in the aggregate cash surrender value is due predominantly to interest earned on existing policies during reduced by the related mortality costs or premium costs on these policies 
other noninterest income  which includes insurance commissions and insurance related service fees  branch rental income  and income from operating leases  decreased to million in  compared to million in the decrease in other noninterest income is primarily due to the expiration of certain revenue generating operating leases 
revenues from leased equipment totaled thousand in  compared to thousand recorded in these revenues represent income from equipment leased to third parties in connection with operating leases entered into by the company

occupancy and equipment expenses increased to million during  compared with million during the increase in occupancy expenses can be attributed to additional rent expense from the four branches acquired from trust bank 
we also entered into a new lease agreement during the third quarter of for the company s future corporate headquarters 
the relocation of our corporate offices is scheduled to commence in the third quarter of and is expected to be completed by november in addition to increased rent expense  occupancy expenses were also impacted by the rise in computer and software related expenses associated with the ongoing upgrade of the company s hardware and related desktop operating system as well as the conversion of the bank s teller platform system during furthermore  computer related and furniture expenses also grew during in proportion to the increase in staffing levels during the year to support the growth of the bank

the realization of state tax benefits through this regulated investment company ceased effective december  upon the fund s dissolution 
the provision also reflects the utilization of affordable housing tax credits totaling million  compared to million utilized in as previously reported  the california franchise tax board ftb announced on december  that it is taking the position that certain tax deductions related to regulated investment companies will be disallowed pursuant to california senate bill and california assembly bill  which were signed into law in the fourth quarter of east west securities company  inc  a regulated investment company formed and funded in july to raise capital in an efficient and economical manner was dissolved on december  as a result of  among other reasons  proposed legislation to change the tax treatments of rics 
the fund provided state tax benefits beginning in until the end of  when the ric was officially dissolved 
while the company s management continues to believe that the tax benefits realized in previous years were appropriate and fully defensible under the existing tax codes at that time  the company has deemed it prudent to participate in the voluntary compliance initiative  or vci offered by the state of california to avoid certain potential penalties should the ftb choose to litigate its recently announced position about the tax treatment of rics for periods prior to enactment of the legislation described above and should the ftb be successful in that litigation 
pursuant to the vci program  we filed amended california income tax returns on april  for all affected years and paid the resulting taxes and interest due to the ftb 
this amounted to an aggregate payment of million for tax years   and we continue to believe that the tax deductions are appropriate and  as such  we have also filed refund claims for the amounts paid with the amended returns 
these refund claims are reflected as assets in the company s consolidated financial statements 
as a result of these actions amending our california income tax returns and subsequent related filing of refund claims we retain our potential exposure for assertion of an accuracy related penalty should the ftb prevail in its position  in addition to our risk of not being successful in our refund claim for taxes and interest 
our potential exposure to all other penalties  however  has been eliminated through this course of action 
the franchise tax board is currently in the process of reviewing and assessing our refund claims for taxes and interest for tax years through management is continuing to pursue these claims  to monitor developments in the law in this area  and to monitor the status of tax claims with respect to other registered investment companies 
balance sheet analysis our total assets increased billion  or  to billion during the year ended december  the increase in total assets was attributable to a growth in gross loans  rising to a record billion at december   compared to billion at december  we attribute overall loan growth to the continued expansion of lending relationships with new customers as well as cross selling to existing customers  increased loan origination volume from our branch network  and the addition of personnel to enhance and support loan and deposit growth

the carrying value of this security at the time of the writedown was million 
we do not anticipate any further impairment on this security in the foreseeable future 
also  during the third quarter of  we securitized approximately million of multifamily loans through fnma for liquidity and capital management purposes

we continue to place emphasis in the origination of multifamily and commercial real estate loans 
although real estate lending activities are collateralized by real property  these transactions are subject to similar credit evaluation  underwriting and monitoring standards as those applied to commercial business loans 
multifamily and commercial real estate loans accounted for billion or and billion or  respectively  of our loan portfolio at december  in comparison  multifamily and commercial real estate loans accounted for million or and billion or  respectively  of our loan portfolio at december  construction loans

a substantial portion of this business involves california based customers engaged in import activities 
in addition  we also offer ex im financing to various exporters 
these loans are guaranteed by the export import bank of the united states 
of this amount  a significant portion represents loans made to borrowers on the import side of international trade

as of december   we had outstanding million of letters of credit  which were issued to enhance the ratings of revenue bonds used to finance affordable housing projects 
this compares to million as of year end credit facilities for individual projects generally range in size from million to million 
the decrease in outstanding standby letters of credit at december   relative to year end  can be attributed to legislative changes that became effective in these legislative changes have impacted the feasibility and attractiveness of affordable housing projects which has curtailed new issuances of standby letters of credit supporting these activities

generally  our policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status if either i principal or interest payments are past due in excess of days  or ii the full collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain  regardless of the length of past due status 
when a loan reaches nonaccrual status  any interest accrued on the loan is reversed and charged against current income 
in general  subsequent payments received are applied to the outstanding principal balance of the loan 
nonaccrual loans that demonstrate a satisfactory payment trend for several months are returned to full accrual status subject to management s assessment of the full collectibility of the account

 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended 
under sfas no 
 loans are considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  including scheduled interest payments 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as an expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  less costs to sell 
if the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  the deficiency will be charged off against the allowance for loan losses or  alternatively  a specific allocation will be established 
at december   we classified million of our loans as impaired  compared with million at december  specific reserves on impaired loans amounted to million at december  there were no specific reserves on impaired loans at december  our average recorded investment in impaired loans during and were million and million  respectively 
during and  gross interest income that would have been recorded on impaired loans  had they performed in accordance with their original terms  totaled thousand and thousand  respectively 
of this amount  actual interest recognized on impaired loans  on a cash basis  was thousand and thousand  respectively 
allowance for loan losses we are committed to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at a level that is commensurate with estimated and known risks in the loan portfolio 
in addition to regular  quarterly reviews of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management performs an ongoing assessment of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
while we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate at december   future additions to the allowance will be subject to a continuing evaluation of estimated and known  as well as inherent  risks in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses which is charged against current period operating results  and is decreased by the amount of net chargeoffs during the year 
at december   the allowance for loan losses amounted to million  or of total loans  compared with million  or of total loans  at december  the million increase in the allowance for loan losses at december   from year end  reflects million in additional loss provisions and million in loss reserves acquired from trust bank reduced by million in net chargeoffs during the year 
moreover  we reclassed million from the allowance for loan losses to other liabilities during  representing additional loss allowances required for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit related primarily to our trade finance and affordable housing activities 
the provision for loan losses of million recorded in represents a increase from the million in loss provisions recorded during net chargeoffs amounting to million represent of average loans outstanding during this compares to net chargeoffs of million  or of average loans outstanding  during we continue to record loss provisions to compensate for both the continued growth of our loan portfolio  which grew during  and our continued lending focus on increasing our portfolio of commercial real estate  commercial business  including trade finance  and construction loans 
the following table summarizes activity in the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated table allowance for loan losses at or for the year e nded december  dollars in thousands allowance balance  beginning of year    allowance from acquisition   allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit   provision for loan losses    charge offs family residential real estate commercial and industrial real estate business  commercial    automobile other total chargeoffs    recoveries family residential real estate multifamily real estate commercial and industrial real estate business  commercial automobile other total recoveries   net chargeoffs    allowance balance  end of year    average loans outstanding    total gross loans outstanding  end of year    net chargeoffs to average loans allowance for loan losses to total gross loans at end of year our total allowance for loan losses is comprised of two components allocated and unallocated 
we utilize several methodologies to determine the allocated portion of the allowance and to test overall adequacy 
the two primary methodologies  the classification migration model and the individual loan review analysis methodology  provide the basis for determining allocations between the various loan categories as well as the overall adequacy of the allowance 
these methodologies are augmented by ancillary analyses  which include historical loss analyses  peer group comparisons  and analyses based on the federal regulatory interagency policy for loan and lease losses 
the classification migration model looks at pools of loans having similar characteristics and analyzes their loss rates over a historical period 
for each quarter during the period analyzed  each loan pool  except for consumer loans which are analyzed as a homogeneous pool  is further segregated into various risk rating categories based on current internal asset classifications 
the internal asset classification categories we utilize are pass  watch i  watch ii  special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss 
the risk rating categories are then evaluated through the present to determine the amount and timing of losses that are probable of occurring 
in performing our quarterly migration analyses  we analyze net losses  or gross loan chargeoffs reduced by loan recoveries  for each quarter during the preceding five years to create a series of loss ratios 
the numerators of these ratios are the net losses during the quarter in which the applicable losses and recoveries occurred and the denominators are the outstanding balances of each risk rating category at each quarter end 
these ratios determine the historical loss rates to be applied to each risk rating category in the current period 
the loss factors represent the probability of a loan in any given risk rating category migrating to loss 
while the amount of losses actually observed can vary significantly from estimated amounts derived from the model  the loss migration model is designed to be self correcting by taking into account our recent loss experience 
the migration model allows us to make adjustments to the calculated results  some of which affect the historical loss factor calculated by the model and others that affect the model s estimated reserve amount 
these qualitative adjustments may be used to simulate positive or negative trends  economic conditions or internal control strengths and weaknesses 
furthermore  we also utilize minimum loss factors as a self correcting mechanism to better reflect the loss potential associated with the various portfolios and to preclude the application of loss factors derived from migration analysis  which may be correct from a historical perspective  but in reality do not appropriately measure the risk of a portfolio given current loan origination activity  volume and size of loan  industry concentrations  and or the economy 
and finally  another mechanism that we may utilize involves the establishment of specific allowances for certain loans for which management believes the probability of loss to be in excess of the amount determined by the application of the migration model 
these specific allowances for individual loans are incorporated into the migration model to determine the overall allowance requirement 
the individual loan review analysis method provides a more contemporaneous assessment of the loan portfolio by incorporating individual asset evaluations prepared by both our credit administration department and an independent external credit review group 
specific monitoring policies and procedures are applied in analyzing the existing loan portfolios which vary according to relative risk profile 
residential single family and consumer loans are relatively homogeneous and no single loan is individually significant in terms of size or probable risk of loss 
therefore  residential and consumer portfolios are analyzed as a pool of loans  and individual loans are criticized or classified based solely on performance 
in contrast  the monitoring process for multifamily  commercial real estate  construction  and commercial business loans include a periodic review of individual loans 
depending on loan size and type  loans are reviewed at least annually  and more frequently if warranted by circumstances 
for instance  loans that are performing but have shown some signs of weakness are subjected to more stringent reporting and oversight 
real estate loans and commercial business loans which are subject to individual loan review  and out of cycle individually reviewed loans  are monitored based on problem loan indicators such as delinquencies  loan covenant or reporting violations  and property tax status 
the estimated exposure and subsequent chargeoffs that result from these individual loan reviews provide the basis for loss factors assigned to the various loan categories 
the results from the classification migration model and the individual loan review analysis are then compared to various analyses  including historical losses  peer group comparisons and the federal regulatory interagency policy for loan and lease losses  to determine an overall allowance requirement amount 
factors that are considered in determining the final allowance requirement amount are scope and volume of completed individual loan reviews during the period  trends and applicability of historical loss migration analysis compared to current loan portfolio concentrations  and comparison of allowance levels to actual historical losses 
the following table reflects our allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category and the ratio of each loan category to total loans as of the dates indicated table allowance for loan losses by loan category at decemb er  amount amount amount amount amount dollars in tho usands family residential real estate multifamily real estate    commercial and industrial real estate    construction    business  commercial    automobile consumer and other  other risks    total    allocated reserves on single family loans increased thousand  or  to thousand due primarily to a increase in the volume of single family loans at december  in comparison to year end levels 
similarly  allocated reserves on multifamily loans increased million  or  to million at december  due primarily to a increase in the volume of multifamily loans at december  from year end levels 
further contributing to the increase in allocated reserves on multifamily loans is an increase in both criticized ie rated special mention and classified ie rated substandard and doubtful loans at december  relative to year end specifically  multifamily loans rated special mention and substandard totaled million and million  respectively  at december   compared to only million and thousand  respectively  at december  allocated reserves on commercial real estate loans increased million  or  to million at december  due primarily to a increase in the volume of loans in this loan category relative to year end additionally  commercial real estate loans rated special mention and substandard increased to million and million  respectively  at december  this compares to million and million  respectively  in loans rated special mention and substandard at december  the increase in required reserves related to these factors was partially offset by the elimination of the hotel motel industry risk allocation at december   compared to at december  the hotel motel industry risk allocation was initially established in response to the anticipated fallout from the events of september th 
while the tragedy of september th did not have a direct impact on our portfolio of hotel and motel loans  we continued to maintain this industry risk allocation over the past several quarters based on the weakened condition of the travel and tourism industry in the months and years following the september th tragedy 
management has reassessed our current credit exposure in this segment of the loan portfolio and determined that the hotel motel industry risk allocation is no longer necessary at december  allocated reserves on construction loans increased million  or  to million at december  primarily due to a increase in the volume of loans in this category when compared to december  allocated loss reserves on commercial business loans increased million  or  to million at december  due primarily to a increase in the volume of loans in this category compared to year end levels as well as increase in required reserves on commercial business loans that are placed on the watchlist and rated special mention 
we have observed rising chargeoff trends in this loan category in the past couple of years  both in frequency and size 
based on these observed patterns  we felt that the previous minimum loss rates established for the watchlist and special mention risk classifications did not adequately address the potential credit risk concerns of commercial business loans placed in these categories 
as such  we have determined it prudent to increase the minimum loss rates in these risk categories for commercial business loans during the first quarter of furthermore  commercial business loans rated special mention also increased to million at december   compared with thousand at december  partially offsetting the impact of these factors is a decrease in the volume of classified commercial business loans to million at december   from million at year end despite a decrease in the volume of loans in this category  allocated reserves on automobile loans increased thousand  or  to thousand as of december  primarily as a result of a basis point increase to in the minimum loss rates established for automobile loans rated pass 
this change was implemented during the first quarter of during the past year  we routinely experienced chargeoffs in this loan category  and on several occasions  we have had to chargeoff loans with no previously manifested or observable credit weaknesses 
as such  we determined that an increase in the minimum loss rate on loans rated pass was warranted due to the frequency and rate at which loans in this category migrate from pass to loss 
allocated reserves on consumer loans increased million  or  to million at december  consumer loans are comprised predominantly of home equity loans and home equity lines of credit  and to a lesser extent  credit card and overdraft protection lines 
the increase in allocated reserves on consumer loans is due  in part  to a increase in the volume of loans in this category relative to year end more significantly  however  the increase in allocated reserves on consumer loans can be attributed to the increase in minimum loss rates for loans rated pass to  compared to at december  the change was initiated as of june  when we started to discern credit issues related to this segment of our portfolio as evidenced by increasing delinquency trends 
moreover  we feel that our loss exposure relative to this portfolio is greater in light of rising interest rates and our subordinate position with respect to collateral 
the allowance for loan losses of million at december  exceeded the allocated allowance by million  or of the total allowance 
this compares to an unallocated allowance of million  also representing of the total allowance  as of december  the million unallocated allowance at december  is comprised of two elements 
the first element  which accounts for million of the unallocated allowance  represents a economic risk factor that takes into consideration the sustained recessionary state of the national economy 
this condition has been exacerbated by scandals linked to various large corporations and government sponsored entities  the continuing geopolitical instability in the middle east  and the devaluation of the us dollar relative to other currencies 
while recent economic reports show some positive indications  the economic forecast in the foreseeable future is  to a large extent  still tenuous at best 
in consideration of this uncertain economic outlook  our management has deemed it prudent to continue to set aside an additional of the required allowance amount to compensate for this current economic risk 
the second element  which accounts for approximately million  or approximately of the allocated allowance amount of million at december   was established to compensate for the modeling risk associated with the classification migration and individual loan review analysis methodologies 
these risk factors are consistent with allocations set aside in prior periods 
deposits we offer a wide variety of deposit account products to both consumer and commercial customers 
time deposit products  consisting primarily of retail fixed rate certificates of deposit  comprised and of the deposit portfolio at december  and  respectively 
other deposit products  which include noninterest bearing demand accounts  interest bearing checking accounts  savings accounts and money market accounts  accounted for the remaining and of the deposit portfolio at december  and  respectively 
deposits increased billion  or  to billion at december  organic deposit growth  excluding the million in deposits acquired from trust bank  increased billion  or during the year 
this organic deposit growth was comprised of noninterest bearing demand deposits of million or  interest bearing checking accounts of million or  money market accounts of million or  savings deposits of million or  and time deposits of million or 
the growth in non time deposit accounts can be attributed to the bank s efforts to expand its small and mid sized commercial customer base through innovative programs at the retail branches that better align with the needs of these customers while the growth in time deposits is due to the introduction of various new products and promotions during the year 
one of the new products that we introduced during was a promotional equity index certificate of deposit that has an interest rate linked to the hang seng china enterprises index the hscei 
we had two limited offerings of this product during the second half of the year 
we raised million in total deposits with year maturities as a result of these promotions 
we offered two versions of this product guaranteed interest per annum and interest paid on first offering or second offering of the performance of the hscei  and no interest guarantee and interest paid on first offering or second offering of the performance of the hscei 
in both cases  the customers principal investment is guaranteed and insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  a certificate of deposit that pays interest based on changes in an equity index is a hybrid instrument with an embedded derivative ie equity call option that must be accounted for separately from the host contract ie the certificate of deposit 
the combined fair value of the embedded derivatives at december  amounted to million and is included in interest bearing deposits on the consolidated balance sheet 
to manage our risk exposure on this product  we have entered into freestanding equity swap agreements with a major investment brokerage firm with a combined notional amount of million 
the notional amounts and terms of the equity swap agreements match the principal amounts and terms of the issued certificates of deposit 
in accordance with sfas no 
 both the embedded equity call options on the certificates of deposit and the freestanding equity swap agreements are marked to market every month with resulting changes in fair values recorded in the statements of income 
for the year ended december   the impact on the consolidated statements of income related to these swaps was an expense of thousand 
brokered deposits increased to million at december  from million a year ago 
the significant increase in brokered deposits is directly correlated to our substantial loan growth during public deposits increased to million at december   compared to million as of december  the balance of public funds is comprised almost entirely of deposits from the state of california 
notwithstanding our portfolio of public deposits  our principal market strategy continues to be based on our role as a community bank that provides quality products and personal customer service 
time deposits greater than thousand totaled billion  accounting for of the deposit portfolio at december  these accounts  consisting primarily of deposits by consumers and public funds  had a weighted average interest rate of at december  the following table provides the remaining maturities at december  of time deposits greater than thousand in thousands table time deposits greater than  months or less  over months through months  over months through months  over months  total  borrowings we utilize both fhlb advances and short term borrowings  which consist of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  to manage our liquidity position 
fhlb advances increased to million as of december   representing an increase of million from december  of the million in outstanding fhlb advances as of december   million represent overnight borrowings 
during  we continued to capitalize on favorable borrowing rates from the fhlb to augment our funding sources 
fhlb advances had a weighted average interest rate of and at december  and  respectively 
of the outstanding fhlb advances at december   million or had remaining maturities greater than one year 
we had no outstanding short term borrowings at december   compared to million in federal funds purchased at december  off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations in the course of our business  we may enter into or be a party to transactions that are not recorded on the balance sheet and are considered to be off balance sheet arrangements 
off balance sheet arrangements are any contractual arrangements whereby an unconsolidated entity is a party  under which we have any obligation under a guarantee contract  a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets  any obligation under certain derivative instruments  any obligation under a material variable interest held by us in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us  or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with us 
loan securitizations and sales from time to time  we securitize certain real estate loans  a portion of which are sold to investors 
securitizations provide us with a source of liquidity and also reduce our credit exposure to borrowers 
securitizations involve the sale of loans to a qualifying special purpose entity  or qspe  typically a trust 
generally  in a securitization  we transfer financial assets to a qspe that is legally isolated from the company 
the qspe  in turn  issues interest bearing securities  commonly called asset backed securities  that are secured by future collections on the sold loans 
the qspe sells securities to investors  which entitle them to receive specified cash flows during the term of the securities 
the qspe uses proceeds from the sale of these securities to pay the purchase price for the sold loans 
the proceeds from the issuance of the securities are then distributed to the company as consideration for the loans transferred 
when we sell or securitize loans  we generally retain the right to service the loans and we may retain residual and other interests  which are considered retained interests in the securitized assets 
retained interests may provide credit enhancement to the investors and represent the company s maximum risk exposure associated with these transactions 
investors in the securities issued by the qspe have no further recourse against the company if cash flows generated by the securitized assets are inadequate to service the obligations of the qspe 
additional information pertaining to our securitization transactions and related retained interests is included in note residual interest in securitization to the consolidated financial statements 
in the ordinary course of business  the company also sells loans with or without recourse 
for loans sold with recourse  the recourse component is considered a guarantee 
in certain situations  the company could also have an obligation for loans sold without recourse 
additional information pertaining to our loan sales is included in note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 
commitments  guarantees and contingencies as a financial service provider  we routinely enter into commitments to extent credit to customers  such as loan commitments  commercial letters of credit for foreign and domestic trade  standby letters of credit and financial guarantees 
many of these commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
the same credit policies are used in extending these commitments as in extending loan facilities to customers 
under some of these contractual agreements  the company may also have liabilities contingent upon the occurrence of certain events 
a discussion of significant contractual arrangements under which the company may be held contingently liable  is included in note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the company has commitments and obligations under postretirement benefit plans as described in note employee benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the following table presents  as of december   the company s significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations  within the categories described below  by payment date

at december   stockholders equity totaled million  a increase from the year end balance of million 
the increase is comprised of the following net income of million recorded during  stock compensation costs amounting to million related to our restricted stock award program  tax benefits of million resulting from the exercise of nonqualified stock options  net issuance of common stock totaling million  representing  shares  from the exercise of stock options and stock warrants  net issuance of common stock totaling million  or  shares  in connection with the employee stock purchase plan and shares issued in lieu of board of director retainer fees  issuance of common stock totaling million  or  shares  in private placement offerings with two institutional investors  and issuance of common stock totaling million  or  shares  in connection with the trust bank acquisition 
these transactions were offset by payments of quarterly cash dividends totaling million and a decrease of million in unrealized gains on available for sale securities 
private placement offerings on march   the company completed a private placement of common stock with two institutional investors amounting to approximately million 
the transaction involved the sale of  shares of common stock at a purchase price of approximately per share 
in addition  the company granted the investors a right to purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock at approximately per share  or up to an additional million 
the investors exercised their purchase option on august  net proceeds from the offerings were used to support the continued growth of the company 
the company completed the registration of the common stock sold to the investors as well as the shares covered by the investors options with the securities and exchange commission under the securities act of during april on june  and november   the company issued million and million  respectively  in junior subordinated debt securities in two separate private placement transactions 
similar to previous offerings  these securities were issued through newly formed statutory business trusts  east west capital trust iv and east west capital trust v  or the trusts  which are wholly owned subsidiaries of the company 
the proceeds from the debt securities are loaned by the trusts to the company and are reported in the consolidated balance sheet as junior subordinated debt 
the securities issued by east west capital trust iv have a scheduled maturity date of june  and bear an initial interest rate of per annum 
the interest rate adjusts quarterly based on the month libor plus 
interest payments are due quarterly on january  april  july  and october of each year 
similarly  the securities issued by east west capital trust v have a scheduled maturity date of november  and bear an initial interest rate of per annum 
the interest rate adjusts quarterly based on the month libor plus 
interest payments are due quarterly on february  may  august  and november of each year 
these additional issuances of capital securities provide the bank with a cost effective means of obtaining tier i capital for regulatory purposes 
in store banking agreement on august   we entered into a ten year agreement with ranch market to provide in store retail banking services to their stores throughout california 
ranch market is the largest asian focused chain of supermarkets on the west coast  with twenty two full service stores in california  two in washington  and affiliated licensee stores in arizona  georgia  hawaii  nevada  and indonesia 
tawa supermarket companies tawa is the parent company of ranch market 
in conjunction with this agreement  we issued  warrants to senior executives of ranch market to purchase common stock of the company at a price of per share 
these warrants will vest over six years and are intended to provide direct benefit to ranch market executives who make a significant contribution to the success of the in store banking operations 
the estimated total fair value of the issued warrants was million 
as of december    warrants out of the  warrants initially issued have been exercised 
we have not experienced nor do we anticipate any material increases in overhead expenses or capital investments as a result of this agreement with ranch market

risk based capital we are committed to maintaining capital at a level sufficient to assure our shareholders  our customers and our regulators that our company and our bank subsidiary are financially sound 
we are subject to risk based capital regulations adopted by the federal banking regulators in january these guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy and are based on an institution s asset risk profile and off balance sheet exposures 
according to the regulations  institutions whose tier i and total capital ratios meet or exceed and  respectively  are deemed to be well capitalized 
at december   the bank s tier i and total capital ratios were and  respectively  compared to and  respectively  at december the following table compares east west bancorp  inc s and east west bank s actual capital ratios at december   to those required by regulatory agencies for capital adequacy and well capitalized classification purposes table regulatory required ratios minimum well east west east west regulato ry capitalized bancorp bank requireme nts requirements total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to average assets asset liability and market risk management liquidity liquidity management involves our ability to meet cash flow requirements arising from fluctuations in deposit levels and demands of daily operations  which include funding of securities purchases  providing for customers credit needs and ongoing repayment of borrowings 
our liquidity is actively managed on a daily basis and reviewed periodically by the asset liability committee and the board of directors 
this process is intended to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet the needs of the bank  including adequate cash flow for off balance sheet instruments 
our primary sources of liquidity are derived from financing activities which include the acceptance of customer and broker deposits  federal funds facilities  repurchase agreement facilities and advances from the federal home loan bank of san francisco 
these funding sources are augmented by payments of principal and interest on loans  the routine liquidation of securities from the available for sale portfolio and securitizations of eligible loans 
primary uses of funds include withdrawal of and interest payments on deposits  originations and purchases of loans  purchases of investment securities  and payment of operating expenses 
during the years ended december  and  we experienced net cash inflows of million and million  respectively  from operating activities 
net cash inflows from operating activities during and were primarily due to net income earned during the year 
net cash outflows from investing activities totaled billion and million during and  respectively 
net cash outflows from investing activities for both periods can be attributed primarily to the substantial growth in our loan portfolio and purchases of available for sale securities 
these activities were partially offset by repayments  maturities  redemptions and net sales proceeds from investment securities available for sale 
we experienced net cash inflows from financing activities of billion and million during and  respectively 
deposit growth  a net increase in fhlb advances  and proceeds from the issuance of junior subordinated debt partially offset by dividends paid on the company s common stock accounted for the net cash inflows from financing activities during both periods 
additionally  proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to a private placement offering with two institutional investors further contributed to net cash inflows from financing activities during as a means of augmenting our liquidity  we have established federal funds lines with four correspondent banks and several master repurchase agreements with major brokerage companies 
at december   the company s available borrowing capacity includes million in federal funds line facilities  million in reverse repurchase arrangements and billion in unused fhlb advances 
we believe our liquidity sources to be stable and adequate to meet our operating needs and other cash commitments 
at december   we were not aware of any information that was reasonably likely to have a material effect on our liquidity position 
the liquidity of east west bancorp  inc is primarily dependent on the payment of cash dividends by its subsidiary  east west bank  subject to limitations imposed by the financial code of the state of california 
for the years ended december  and  total dividends paid by the bank to east west bancorp  inc amounted to million and million  respectively 
as of december   approximately million of undivided profits of the bank were available for dividends to the company 
interest rate sensitivity management our success is largely dependent upon our ability to manage interest rate risk  which is the impact of adverse fluctuations in interest rates on our net interest income and net portfolio value 
although in the normal course of business we manage other risks  such as credit and liquidity risk  we consider interest rate risk to be our most significant market risk and could potentially have the largest material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the fundamental objective of the asset liability management process is to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations while maintaining adequate levels of liquidity and capital 
our strategy is formulated by the asset liability committee  which coordinates with the board of directors to monitor our overall asset and liability composition 
the committee meets regularly to evaluate  among other things  the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses on the available for sale portfolio including those attributable to hedging transactions  if any  purchase and securitization activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
our overall strategy is to minimize the adverse impact of immediate incremental changes in market interest rates rate shock on net interest income and net portfolio value 
net portfolio value is defined as the present value of assets  minus the present value of liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
the attainment of this goal requires a balance between profitability  liquidity and interest rate risk exposure 
to minimize the adverse impact of changes in market interest rates  we simulate the effect of instantaneous interest rate changes on net interest income and net portfolio value on a monthly basis 
the table below shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and market value of equity as of december  and  assuming a parallel shift of to basis points in both directions table rate shock table net interest income net portfolio value volatility volatility change in interest rates december  december  december  december  basis points the percentage change represents net interest income for twelve months in a stable interest rate environment versus net interest income in the various rate scenarios 
the percentage change represents net portfolio value of the bank in a stable rate environment versus net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios 
all interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and related derivative contracts are included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis at december  and at december  and  our estimated changes in net interest income and net portfolio value were within the ranges established by the board of directors 
our primary analytical tool to gauge interest rate sensitivity is a simulation model used by many major banks and bank regulators  and is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the model attempts to predict changes in the yields earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities in relation to changes in market interest rates 
as an enhancement to the primary simulation model  prepayment assumptions and market rates of interest provided by independent broker dealer quotations  an independent pricing model and other available public sources are incorporated into the model 
adjustments are made to reflect the shift in the treasury and other appropriate yield curves 
the model also factors in projections of anticipated activity levels by product line and takes into account our increased ability to control rates offered on deposit products in comparison to our ability to control rates on adjustable rate loans tied to published indices 
the following tables provide the outstanding principal balances and the weighted average interest rates of our financial instruments as of december  the information presented below is based on the repricing date for variable rate instruments and the expected maturity date for fixed rate instruments

expected maturities for deposits are based on contractual maturities adjusted for projected rollover rates and changes in pricing for deposits with no stated maturity dates 
we utilize assumptions supported by documented analyses for the expected maturities of our loans and repricing of our deposits 
we also rely on third party data providers for prepayment projections for amortizing securities 
the actual maturities of these instruments could vary significantly if future prepayments and repricing differ from our expectations based on historical experience 
the fair values of short term investments approximate their book values due to their short maturities 
the fair values of available for sale securities are based on bid quotations from third party data providers 
the fair values of loans are estimated for portfolios with similar financial characteristics and takes into consideration discounted cash flows based on expected maturities or repricing dates utilizing estimated market discount rates as projected by third party data providers 
transaction deposit accounts  which include checking  money market and savings accounts  are presumed to have equal book and fair values because the interest rates paid on these accounts are based on prevailing market rates 
the fair value of time deposits is based upon the discounted value of contractual cash flows  which is estimated using current rates offered for deposits of similar remaining terms 
the fair value of short term borrowings approximates book value due to their short maturities 
the fair value of fhlb advances is estimated by discounting the cash flows through maturity or the next repricing date based on current rates offered by the fhlb for borrowings with similar maturities 
the fair value of junior subordinated debt is estimated by discounting the cash flows through maturity based on current market rates 
the asset liability committee is authorized to utilize a wide variety of off balance sheet financial techniques to assist in the management of interest rate risk 
we sometimes use derivative financial instruments as part of our asset and liability management strategy  with the overall goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest margin and stockholders equity 
the use of derivatives has not had a material effect on our operating results or financial position 
in august and november  we entered into equity swap agreements with a major investment brokerage firm to hedge against market fluctuations in a promotional equity index certificate of deposit product that we offered to bank customers for a limited time during the latter half of this product  which has a term of years  pays interest based on the performance of the hscei 
the combined notional amounts of the equity swap agreements total million with termination dates similar to the stated maturity date on the underlying certificate of deposit host contracts 
for the equity swap agreements  we pay interest based on the one month libor minus a spread on a monthly basis and receive any increase in the hscei at swap termination date 
in accordance with sfas no 
 both the embedded equity call options on the certificates of deposit and the freestanding equity swap agreements are marked to market every month with resulting changes in fair value recorded in the statements of income 
the combined fair value of the embedded derivatives at december  amounted to million and is included in interest bearing deposits on the consolidated balance sheet 
the fair value of the equity swap agreements total thousand at december  the fair value of the equity swap agreements and embedded equity call options are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on expectations of libor rates and the change in value of the hscei based upon the life of the individual swap agreement
