item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis represents an overview of the results of operations and financial condition of the corporation 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
important note regarding forward looking statements certain statements in this annual report are forward looking within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  which statements generally can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology  such as may  will  expect  estimate  anticipate  believe  target  plan  project or continue or the negatives thereof or other variations thereon or similar terminology  and are made on the basis of management s plans and current analyses of the corporation  its business and the industry as a whole 
these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  economic conditions  competition  interest rate sensitivity and exposure to regulatory and legislative changes 
the above factors in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the corporation s financial performance and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such forward looking statements 
the corporation does not undertake to publicly update or revise its forward looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized 
application of critical accounting policies the corporation s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the corporation are presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements  which are included in item of this report 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the following accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
allowance for loan losses the corporation maintains an allowance for losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolios 
the allowance for loan losses is reflected as a contra asset account  or reserve  against loans and leases in the balance sheet 
loan losses are charged off against the allowance for loan losses  with recoveries of amounts previously charged off credited to the allowance for loan losses 
provisions for loan losses are charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of adequacy of the allowance 
the provision for credit losses provides for probable losses on loans and leases 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolios 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and estimates of collateral values  where applicable 
management s estimate of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses includes individual evaluation and assessment of individual impaired loans  pools of homogeneous loans sharing common risk factors and other economic and environmental risk factors that may impact anticipated losses within these credits 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from 
table of contents management s estimates  additional provisions for credit losses may be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial positions in future periods 
reserve estimates for individually impaired loans are based upon individual assessment of larger balance credits that are evaluated by management at least quarterly to establish individual estimates of loss exposure 
these analyses entail a high degree of judgment to reasonably estimate the amount of loss associated with specific impaired loans  including estimating the amount and timing of cash flows as well as the values of pledged collateral and guarantees applicable to each unique situation 
loans depending entirely on the sale of pledged collateral for repayment require estimating the values anticipated from the sale of collateral  as well as estimating the timing and volume of expenses associated with the maintaining of the collateral during the company s marketing and sales efforts 
historical loss experiences serve as the basis for estimating losses on homogeneous loans that share common risk characteristics 
loss histories for each respective pool of loans are evaluated by management to consider inherent but undetected losses within these pools 
consideration is given to other factors that may cause current losses to deviate from their historical performance 
such consideration involves evaluating changes in credit underwriting guidelines to evaluate the affects such changes may have on current losses  as well as analysis of current economic conditions that may impact the level and volume of losses realized 
other relevant environmental factors considered by management in estimating losses include evaluation of levels and trends in delinquencies  non performing and charge offs  and also trends in management s internal credit risk ratings 
independent loan review results are evaluated and considered in estimating reserves as well as the experience  ability and depth of lending management and staff 
the consideration of this component of the allowance requires considerable judgment in order to estimate inherent loss exposures 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
the majority of the corporation s goodwill relates to value inherent in its banking and insurance businesses 
the amount of goodwill is impacted by the fair value of underlying assets and liabilities acquired  including loans  deposits and long term debt  that are significantly influenced by management s estimates and assumptions which are judgmental in nature 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
similarly  estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
the corporation performs an internal valuation analysis and considers other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows  market comparisons and recent transactions 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows  discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  growth rate and determination and evaluation of appropriate market comparables 
the value of this goodwill is dependent upon the corporation s ability to provide quality  cost effective services in the face of competition 
as such  goodwill value is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted and the market value of the assets under administration 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the corporation s inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill which could result in additional expense and adversely impact earnings in future periods 
overview as explained in more detail in part i  item  business  of this report  on january  the corporation completed the spin off of its florida operations 
as such  fnb corporation is a diversified financial services company headquartered in hermitage  pennsylvania 
the corporation is a leading provider of community banking  wealth management  insurance and consumer finance services through its affiliates first national 
table of contents bank of pennsylvania  first national trust company  first national investment services company  fnb investment advisors  inc  first national insurance agency  inc and regency finance company 
as of december   the corporation had full service banking offices in pennsylvania and ohio and consumer finance offices in pennsylvania  ohio and tennessee 
the accommodative monetary policy followed by the federal reserve board in recent years had placed interest rates at historically low levels by the beginning of as a result  the corporation experienced accelerated loan and investment security prepayments during these prepayments resulted in lower earning asset yields as these cash flows were reinvested at lower rates 
the net interest margin more fully reflected the impact of this activity  offsetting the favorable impact that growth in earning assets had on net interest income 
in addition  net interest income growth was further challenged as a result of the managed reduction of the indirect loan and fixed rate mortgage portfolios 
during the second quarter of  the economic expansion was considered well underway and the market became increasingly concerned about inflation 
subsequently  the federal reserve board increased short term rates five times totaling during the remainder of  resulting in a flatter yield curve 
the corporation took action to help stabilize net interest income  including containing deposit costs as rates increased  refinancing certain federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings and acquiring slippery rock financial corporation slippery rock 
for information pertaining to the acquisition of slippery rock  see the mergers and acquisitions footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements  which is included in item of this report 
total average loans increased primarily as a result of the corporation s acquisition of slippery rock in the fourth quarter of excluding this acquisition  the corporation s average loans were essentially flat as the corporation executed on its planned focus on more desirable customer relationship oriented portfolios of commercial and home equity loans and lines of credit while decreasing the fixed rate mortgages  indirect loans and indirect automobile leases portfolios 
total average deposit growth was primarily attributable to the addition of slippery rock in the fourth quarter of in addition  the corporation experienced a favorable shift in its deposit mix toward core deposit categories of non interest bearing demand  interest bearing demand and savings accounts and away from more price sensitive certificates of deposit 
the corporation also experienced robust growth in its customer repurchase agreements resulting from the implementation of a strategic initiative to increase and expand the corporation s commercial lending relationships 
in an effort to mitigate the impact of a narrower net interest margin in  the corporation focused on growing its core based businesses of insurance and wealth management 
the former was favorably impacted by the acquisition of morrell  butz and junker  inc mbj  one of the largest independent insurance agencies in the pittsburgh  pennsylvania market 
this acquisition expanded the corporation s presence in this customer relationship oriented business and will provide for a growth platform through the attraction of new customer relationships as well as expansion of existing customer relationships through cross sell initiatives with other business segments 
for information pertaining to the acquisition of mbj  see the mergers and acquisitions footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements  which is included in item of this report 
the corporation s wealth management segment  on the other hand  benefited from its successful sales of investment products and services through the corporation s branch network in in addition  first national trust company enhanced its profit margin through its planned attrition of lower profitability customer relationships coupled with the implementation of expense reduction initiatives resulting from the spin off 
the corporation further benefited from its successful implementation of expense reduction initiatives in across most of its segments  as a result of the spin off 
asset quality improved during the first three quarters of  although some of the benefits were lessened with the acquisition of slippery rock 
prior to the acquisition  the corporation experienced favorable trends in key asset quality indicators including declines in delinquent loans  non performing assets and net loan charge offs as a percentage of average loans 
the addition of slippery rock led to an increase of these same measures during the fourth quarter  which led to an increase in the fourth quarter provision for loan losses corresponding with the credit risk inherent to the acquired slippery rock portfolio 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income for was million or per diluted share  as compared to income from continuing operations for of million or 
per diluted share  which included after tax restructuring charges of million or 
per diluted share related to the spin off of the corporation s florida operations 
net income for  including discontinued operations  totaled million or per diluted share 
the corporation s earning asset growth resulted from increases in the corporation s investment securities portfolio and the customer relationship oriented portfolios of commercial and consumer loans  partially offset by reductions in mortgages  indirect loans and indirect automobile leases 
in addition  fee income growth in resulted from increases in insurance commissions and security sales commissions 
while the former was favorably impacted by the acquisition of mbj  the latter was a result of the corporation s successful sales efforts through its branch network and through cross selling efforts 
lastly  also favorably impacting earnings  the corporation experienced lower expenses in as compared to primarily as a result of the successful implementation of expense reductions related to the spin off of the florida operations and restructuring charges totaling million in related to the spin off 
these positive factors were partially offset by a lower net interest margin as previously explained in the overview section above  lower gains on sale of loans  as rising interest rates lead to a slow down in mortgage refinancing activity  and lower gains on sale of securities 
further  the corporation s effective tax rate was historically lower in primarily as a result of the restructuring charges taken in return on average equity was  while return on average assets was for the year ended december   as compared to and  in  respectively 

table of contents the following table provides information regarding the average balances and yields and rates on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities dollars in thousands twelve months ended december  interest interest interest average income yield average income yield average income yield balance expense rate balance expense rate balance expense rate assets interest earning assets interest bearing deposits with banks federal funds sold short term investments taxable investment securities non taxable investment securities loans total interest earning assets cash and due from banks allowance for loan losses premises and equipment other assets assets of discontinued operations liabilities interest bearing liabilities deposits interest bearing demand savings other time repurchase agreements other short term borrowings long term debt total interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing demand other liabilities liabilities of discontinued operations stockholders equity excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities net interest income net interest spread net interest margin the average balances and yields earned on securities are based on historical cost 
the amounts are reflected on a fully taxable equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 
average balances include non accrual loans 
loans consist of average total loans less average unearned income 
the amount of loan fees included in interest income on loans is immaterial 
net interest margin is calculated by dividing the difference between total interest earned and total interest paid by total interest earning assets 

table of contents net interest income net interest income  which is the corporation s major source of revenue  is the difference between interest income from earning assets loans  securities and federal funds sold and interest expense paid on liabilities deposits and short and long term borrowings 
in  net interest income  which comprised of total revenue as compared to in  was affected by the general level of interest rates  changes in interest rates  the steepness of the yield curve and the changes in the amount and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  was million for both and while the corporation s net interest margin decreased from by basis points  to in  average earning assets increased million or for the same period 
the corporation s net interest margin was impacted by historically low levels of interest rates in which led to accelerated loan and investment security prepayments 
these prepayments resulted in lower earning assets yields as these cash flows were reinvested at lower rates 
in managing its net interest margin  the corporation took actions to reduce the cost of funds on its interest bearing liabilities by managing the cost of its deposits and prepaying certain higher cost fhlb borrowings 
more details on changes in tax equivalent net interest income are attributed to changes in earning assets  interest bearing liabilities yields and cost of funds in the preceding table 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding changes in net interest income attributable to changes in the volumes of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and changes in the rates for the periods indicated in thousands year ended december  volume rate net volume rate net interest income interest bearing deposits with banks federal funds sold securities loans interest expense deposits interest bearing demand savings other time repurchase agreements other short term borrowings long term debt net change the amount of change not solely due to rate or volume changes was allocated between the change due to rate and the change due to volume based on the net size of the rate and volume changes 
interest income  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  of million in decreased by million or from this decrease was caused by a reduction in yield on earning assets of basis points  to in as noted previously  this reduction in yields was the direct result of accelerated prepayments in the investment security and loan portfolios resulting in new volume in being originated at rates that were lower than the overall portfolio yields 
partially offsetting this trend  average earning assets of billion in grew million or from driven by an increase of million in investment securities and an 
table of contents increase of million in loans 
the former is attributable primarily to the corporation s efforts to stabilize interest income 
the latter is the result of the corporation s acquisition of slippery rock in the fourth quarter of interest expense of million in decreased by million or from the same period in this variance was primarily attributable to a decrease of basis points in the corporation s cost of funds to in during  the corporation took actions to reduce the cost of funds on its interest bearing liabilities by managing the cost of its deposits and prepaying certain higher cost fhlb advances 
partially offsetting this decrease in cost of funds  interest bearing liabilities increased million or to average billion in this growth was primarily attributable to a combined increase of million or in the core deposit categories of interest bearing demand deposit and savings and customer repurchase agreements  partially offset by a decrease in higher cost time deposits of million or 
in addition  average long term debt of million in increased million or from while average short term borrowings of million in decreased million or 
this trend was the result of the corporation s strategy to lengthen funding and lock in borrowings at a time of historically low interest rates 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is determined based on management s estimates of the appropriate level of allowance for loan losses needed to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio  after giving consideration to charge offs and net recoveries for the period 
the provision for loan losses of million in decreased  or from primarily due to improved credit quality and a shift in mix of the corporation s loan portfolio toward the higher quality  relationship oriented commercial loans  direct installment loans and lines of credit and away from indirect loans and indirect auto leases 
more specifically  in net charge offs totaled million or 
as a percentage of average loans as compared to million or 
as a percentage of average loans in for additional information  refer to the allowance for loan losses section 
with respect to loan mix  the corporation s combined mix of commercial loans  direct installment loans and consumer lines of credit accounted for of total loans at december  as compared to at december  for more detail on this comparison  refer to the lending activity section 
non interest income total non interest income of million  in  increased million or from this increase resulted primarily from growth in the corporation s core fee income businesses of insurance commissions and securities commissions  coupled with certain one time gains included in other non interest income 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in gains on sale of securities and gains on sale of loans as the latter was impacted by slower mortgage refinancing activity in as compared to insurance commissions and fees of million increased million or primarily as the corporation expanded its presence in this desirable line of business through the acquisition of mbj in july of securities commissions of million in increased million or from as the corporation successfully pursued sales of those products through its branch network and through cross selling efforts 
the successful execution of this strategy resulted in enhanced value to the corporation s customers while providing the corporation with growth in desirable fee income 
trust fees of million in decreased  or as the corporation undertook efforts to exit low profitability accounts in this trend was more than offset by the corporation s efforts to streamline operations and improve productivity 
as reflected in the business segments footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements  which is included in item of this report  net income for the continuing operations of the wealth management segment  which includes securities commissions and trust fees  increased  or from to total million in 
table of contents other income of million in increased million or from  primarily as the corporation recognized certain one time gains during  including million related to the sale of two branches  million from the termination of its servicing arrangement with sun bancorp and million on the stock of sun bancorp  partially offset by  in lower income from bank owned life insurance resulting from lower interest rates in as compared to non interest expense total non interest expense of million in decreased million or from overall  this decrease was primarily attributable to expense reductions  mostly employee related  due to the spin off of the corporation s florida operations 
salaries and employee benefits of million in decreased million or from during  the corporation recognized million in restructuring charges related to the spin off of its florida operations 
the remaining decrease is attributable to the successful implementation of a staff reduction initiative resulting from the spin off of the corporation s florida operations  partially offset by increases related to the acquisition of mbj in july of and slippery rock in october of combined net occupancy and equipment expense of million in  decreased million or from the combined level 
in  the corporation incurred approximately million in restructuring charges related to the spin off of its florida operations 
the remaining decrease is primarily attributable to reductions related to the spin off of the florida operations 
amortization of intangibles expense of million in increased  or from this increase was attributable to the partial year impacts of  related to customer list intangibles resulting from the acquisition of mbj in july of and  related to core deposit intangibles resulting from the acquisition of slippery rock in october of merger and consolidated related expense of million in relates to costs incurred as a result of the acquisition of slippery rock in october of debt extinguishment expense of million in relates to the corporation s repayment of million in higher cost fhlb advances 
additionally in  the corporation incurred million in penalties to prepay million in higher cost fhlb advances in conjunction with the spin off of the florida operations 
other expenses of million in decreased million or 
during  the corporation incurred approximately million in restructuring charges related to the spin off of its florida operations 
income taxes the corporation s income tax expense of million in was at an effective tax rate of while the income tax expense from continuing operations of million was at an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate was impacted by resulting from the benefits relating to restructuring charges being recognized at rates higher than the corporation s overall effective income tax rate 
both years tax rates remain lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to the tax benefits resulting from tax exempt instruments and excludable dividend income 
for additional information refer to the income taxes footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements  which is included in item of this report 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income was million for compared to net income of million for basic earnings per share were and for and  respectively  while diluted earnings per share were and  respectively  for those same periods 
income from continuing operations was million for compared to million for basic earnings per share from continuing operations were

table of contents net interest income net interest income  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  totaled million for versus million in  a decrease of million or 
net interest income consisted of interest income of million and interest expense of million for compared to million and million  respectively  for the corporation s net interest margin decreased basis points to in  as the yield on interest earning assets decreased by basis points and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased by basis points 
during  in order to help revive economic growth  the federal reserve board reduced its target federal funds rate to the lowest level in nearly years 
during the first and second quarters of  concerns about continued economic weakness and possible disinflation drove mid term and long term treasury yields down significantly 
the lower yields  in turn  sparked the refinancing of mortgages in the corporation s loan and mortgage backed security portfolio 
thus  the lower interest rate levels experienced during contributed to the decline in the net interest margin as the yield on earning assets declined by more than the rate on interest bearing liabilities 
total interest income  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  for decreased million or from this decrease was a result of lower yield  partially offset by higher earning assets 
the impact of lower yield was million while the impact of higher earning assets was million 
the decrease in yield was caused primarily by loan refinancing activity and scheduled repricing of adjustable rate loans to lower market rates  coupled with accelerated prepayments of mortgage backed securities 
the growth in earning assets was driven by increases in loans and investment securities 
the increase of million in loans was driven primarily by organic growth in commercial and consumer loans 
the increase of million in securities related to growth in mortgage backed securities resulting from leveraged transactions totaling million during total interest expense decreased million or in this decrease was driven primarily by the lower rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by an increase in interest bearing liabilities 
the impact of a lower rate paid was million while the impact of higher interest bearing liabilities was million 
the decrease in rate paid was driven primarily by actions taken by the corporation to reduce rates paid on deposits and a reduction in the cost of debt  which was partially due to the early retirement of million of higher cost fhlb borrowings during the third quarter of in addition  the corporation continued to successfully generate non interest bearing deposits  which increased million or in the growth in interest bearing liabilities was driven by increases of million or 
in interest bearing deposits  million or in short term borrowings and million or in long term debt 
the increase in long term debt is primarily the result of the debentures due to statutory trust  which were issued in early additionally  the corporation seized on the opportunity to lock in long term funding at relatively low rates through provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses increased to million in see the non performing loans and allowance for loan losses sections for further information 
non interest income total non interest income increased from million in to million in service charges increased million or  while insurance premiums  commissions and fees increased  or to million in these higher levels of fee income are attributable to the corporation s success in generating core deposit fees and a continued focus on non banking products and services such as consumer and commercial insurance services 
gains on the sale of mortgage loans for increased to million as compared to million for the same period in the increase in gains on the sale of mortgage loans was a direct result of increases in homeowner refinancing driven by mortgage interest rates declining to historical low levels 
as mortgage interest rates increase  the corporation anticipates this level of growth in gains to decline 

table of contents non interest expense total non interest expense remained relatively flat at million in during  the corporation recorded restructuring charges related to the spin off of its florida operations totaling million 
these charges were primarily a prepayment penalty in connection with the early retirement of higher cost fhlb borrowings  involuntary separation costs associated with terminated employees  other employment related expenses  professional fees and data processing charges 
in addition  during the corporation recorded merger and consolidation charges of million related to the acquisition of promistar financial corporation promistar 
these expenses were primarily involuntary separation costs associated with terminated employees  other employment related expenses  professional fees and data processing conversion charges 
salary and employee benefits expense of million in increased from this increase includes restructuring charges of million in and higher costs associated with employee medical insurance 
combined occupancy and equipment expense of million in increased million or from  mainly the result of million of fixed asset expenses relating to the spin off of the florida operations 
the increase in other expenses of million or from to includes million in restructuring charges related to the spin off of the florida operations 
income taxes the corporation s income tax expense was million for compared to million for the effective tax rate of was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to the tax benefits resulting from tax exempt instruments and excludable dividend income

liquidity the corporation s goal in liquidity management is to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers as well as the operating cash needs of the corporation with cost effective funding 
liquidity is centrally managed on a daily basis by treasury personnel 
in addition  the corporate asset liability committee alco  which includes members of executive management  reviews liquidity on a periodic basis and approves significant changes in strategies that affect balance sheet or cash flow positions 
the board of directors has established an asset liability policy in order to achieve and maintain earnings performance consistent with long term goals while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk  a well capitalized balance sheet and adequate levels of liquidity 
this policy designates the alco as the body responsible for meeting this objective 
liquidity sources from assets include payments from loans and investments as well as the ability to securitize or sell loans and investment securities 
the corporation continues to originate mortgage loans  most of which are resold in the secondary market 
proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans totaled million for as compared to million for liquidity sources from liabilities are generated primarily through deposits 
as of december   deposits comprised of total liabilities 
to a lesser extent  the corporation also makes use of wholesale sources that include federal funds purchased  repurchase agreements and public funds 
in addition  the corporation has the ability to borrow funds from the fhlb  federal reserve bank and the capital markets 
fhlb advances are a competitively priced and reliable source of funds 
as of december   outstanding advances were million  or of total assets  while the total availability from these sources was billion  or of total assets 
the principal source of cash for the parent company is dividends from its subsidiaries 
the parent also has approved lines of credit with several major domestic banks  which were unused as of december  the corporation also issues subordinated debt on a regular basis 
the corporation has repurchased shares of its common stock for re issuance under various employee benefit plans and the corporation s dividend reinvestment plan since in addition  the corporation has repurchased shares for specific re issuance in connection with certain business combinations accounted for as purchase 
table of contents transactions 
during  the corporation purchased treasury shares totaling million and received million upon re issuance 
in and  the corporation purchased treasury shares totaling million and million  respectively  and received million and million  respectively  as a result of re issuance 
the alco regularly monitors various liquidity ratios and forecasts of cash position 
management believes the corporation has sufficient liquidity available to meet its normal operating and contingency funding cash needs 
interest rate sensitivity the financial performance of the corporation is at risk from interest rate fluctuations 
this interest rate risk arises due to differences between the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities subject to repricing over a period of time  the change in the shape of the yield curve and the prepayment and early redemption opportunities embedded in certain financial instruments 
the corporation utilizes an asset liability model to support its balance sheet strategies 
the corporation uses gap analysis  net interest income simulations and the economic value of equity eve to measure interest rate risk 
gap and eve are static measures that do not incorporate assumptions regarding future business 
gap  while a helpful diagnostic tool  displays cash flows for only a single rate environment 
eve s long term horizon helps identify changes in optionality and longer term positions 
however  eve s liquidation perspective does not translate into the earnings based measures that are the focus of managing and valuing a going concern 
net interest income simulations explicitly measure the exposure to earnings from changes in market rates of interest 
the corporation s current financial position is combined with assumptions regarding future business to calculate net interest income under various hypothetical rate scenarios 
the alco reviews earnings simulations over multiple years under various interest rate scenarios 
the following measures include the effect of the merger with northside bank  which is detailed in the subsequent events footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements  which is included in item of this report 
the following gap analysis compares the difference between the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities subject to repricing over a period of time 
the ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities repricing within a one year period was and 
for the current period of and  respectively 
a ratio of more than one indicates a higher level of repricing assets over repricing liabilities over the next twelve months 
following is the gap analysis for the current period dollars in thousands within total month months months months year interest earning assets iea loans investments interest bearing liabilities ibl non maturity deposits time deposits borrowings period gap cumulative gap iea ibl cumulative cumulative gap to iea 
table of contents the allocation of non maturity deposits to the one month maturity bucket is based on the estimated sensitivity of each product to changes in market rates 
for example  if a product s rate is estimated to increase by as much as the market rates  then of the account balance was placed in this bucket 
the current allocation is representative of the estimated sensitivities for a basis point change in market rates 
the following table presents an analysis of the potential sensitivity of the corporation s annual net interest income and eve to sudden and parallel changes shocks in market rates versus if rates remained unchanged december net interest income change months basis points basis points economic value of equity basis points basis points the corporation s alco is responsible for the identification and management of interest rate risk exposure 
as such  the corporation continuously evaluates strategies to minimize its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
in order to help mitigate the effect of rising interest rates  the alco has transacted strategies during including limiting the length of terms of securities acquired  promoting long term certificates of deposit  locking long term wholesale funds through the fhlb and selling fixed rate mortgages 
in addition  during february  the corporation entered into a forward starting interest rate swap for additional information  refer to the subsequent events footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements  which is included in item of this report 
further  the acquisition of slippery rock contributed to positioning the corporation more favorably for rising interest rates 
the corporation recognizes that asset liability models are based on methodologies that may have inherent shortcomings 
furthermore  asset liability models require certain assumptions be made  such as prepayment rates on earning assets and pricing impact on non maturity deposits  which may differ from actual experience 
these business assumptions are based upon the corporation s experience  business plans and published industry experience 
while management believes such assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that modeled results will approximate actual results 
the analysis may not consider all actions that the corporation could employ in response to changes in market interest rates 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the following table sets forth contractual obligations of the corporation that represent required and potential cash outflows as of december  in thousands within one one to three to after year three years five years five years total deposits without a stated maturity time deposits operating leases long term debt 
table of contents the following table sets forth the amounts and expected maturities of commitments to extend credit and other off balance sheet items as of december  in thousands within one to three to after one year three years five years five years total commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements in that the borrower has the ability to draw upon these commitments at any time and these commitments often expire without being drawn upon 
lending activity the loan portfolio consists principally of loans to individuals and small and medium sized businesses within the corporation s primary market area of western and central pennsylvania and northeastern ohio 
in addition  the portfolio contains consumer finance loans to individuals in pennsylvania  ohio and tennessee 
following is a summary of loans in thousands december commercial direct installment consumer lines of credit residential mortgages indirect installment lease financing other total loans increased by million or to billion at december  the corporation focused on growing the more desirable segments of the loan portfolio as commercial  direct installment and consumer lines of credit combined increased by million or 
this increase was offset by planned reductions in indirect installment and automobile lease financing  which decreased a combined million or 
these tactical reductions are part of a strategic initiative designed to improve asset quality and fee income while focusing attention on more advantageous loan originations consistent with relationship lending 
as of december   no concentrations of loans exceeding of total loans existed that were not disclosed as a separate category of loans 
following is a summary of the maturity distribution of certain loan categories based on remaining scheduled repayments of principal in thousands within over december  year years years total commercial residential mortgages the total amount of loans due after one year includes billion with floating or adjustable rates of interest and million with fixed rates of interest 

table of contents non performing loans non performing loans include non accrual loans and restructured loans 
non accrual loans represent loans on which interest accruals have been discontinued 
restructured loans are loans in which the borrower has been granted a concession on the interest rate or the original repayment terms due to financial distress 
it is the corporation s policy to discontinue interest accruals when principal or interest is due and has remained unpaid for to days or more depending on the loan type  unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  all unpaid interest is reversed 
non accrual loans may not be restored to accrual status until all delinquent principal and interest has been paid 
non performing loans are closely monitored on an ongoing basis as part of the corporation s loan review and work out process 
the potential risk of loss on these loans is evaluated by comparing the loan balance to the fair value of any underlying collateral or the present value of projected future cash flows 
losses are recognized where appropriate

this estimate includes losses associated with specifically identified loans  as well as estimated probable credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio 
additions are made to the allowance through both periodic provisions charged to income and recoveries of losses previously incurred 
reductions to the allowance occur as loan losses are recognized and loans are charged off 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance at least quarterly  and in doing so relies on various factors including  but not limited to  assessment of historical loss experience  delinquency and non accrual trends  portfolio growth  underlying collateral coverage and current economic conditions 
this evaluation is subjective and requires material estimates that may change over time 
the components of the allowance for loan losses represent estimates based upon fas  accounting for contingencies  and fas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
fas applies to smaller balance homogeneous loan pools such as consumer installment  residential mortgages and consumer lines of 
table of contents credit  as well as commercial loans that are not individually evaluated for impairment under fas fas is applied to larger balance commercial loans that are considered impaired 
under fas  a loan is impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that the loan will not be repaid according to its contractual terms  including both principal or interest 
management performs individual assessments of impaired loans to determine the existence of loss exposure and  where applicable  the extent of loss exposure based upon the present value of expected future cash flows available to pay the loan  or based upon the estimated realizable collateral where a loan is collateral dependent 
commercial loans excluded from fas individual impairment analysis are collectively evaluated by management to estimate reserves for loan losses inherent in those loans in accordance with fas in estimating loan loss contingencies  management applies historical loan loss rates and also considers how the loss rates may be impacted by changes in current economic conditions  delinquency and non performing loan trends  changes in loan underwriting guidelines and credit policies  as well as the results of internal loan reviews 
smaller balance homogeneous loan pools are evaluated using similar criteria that are based upon historical loss rates of various loan types 
historical loss rates are adjusted to incorporate changes in existing conditions that may impact  both positively or negatively  the degree to which these loss histories may vary 
this determination inherently involves a high degree of uncertainty and considers current risk factors that may not have occurred in the corporation s historical loan loss experience

table of contents the allowance for loan losses increased million during representing a increase in reserves for loan losses between december  and december  the increase in reserves for loan losses is attributed to the acquisition of slippery rock  which closed in october the slippery rock acquisition brought with it million in loans and associated reserves for loan losses of million  which represented of slippery rock s loans 
the credit risks introduced through the slippery rock loan portfolio support the higher loan loss reserves reported at year end given the inherent risk of assets acquired 
management considers numerous factors when estimating reserves for loan losses  including historical charge off rates and subsequent recoveries 
consideration is given to the impact of changes in qualitative factors that influence the corporation s credit quality  such as the local and regional economies that the corporation serves 
assessment of relevant economic factors indicates that the corporation s primary markets tend to lag the national economy  which has shown improvement since the spring of  with local economies in the corporation s market areas also improving  but at a more measured rate than the national trends 
regional economic factors influencing management s estimate of reserves include uncertainty of the labor markets in the regions the corporation serves and a contracting labor force due  in part  to productivity growth and industry consolidations  which influence the level of reserves required to support commercial and commercial real estate loans 
commercial and commercial real estate loans are influenced by economic conditions within certain sectors of the economy  such as health care  manufacturing and the commercial office and commercial retail sub markets that are pressured by supply imbalances within certain market areas of the corporation s customer base 
pressures on the corporation s healthcare customers include skilled labor shortages  rising liability costs and the risk to medicaid payments as states balance tight budgets 
the year also saw an increase in interest rates  a trend that is projected to continue through rising rates directly affect borrowers tied to floating rate loans as increasing debt service requirements pressure customers that now face higher loan payments 
the corporation also considers how rising interest rates influence consumer loan customers who now carry historically high debt loads 
consideration is also given to delays in bankruptcy reform legislation  which continue to put pressure on the consumer loan portfolios 
consumer credit risk and loss exposures are evaluated using extensive consumer credit score analysis to evaluate risk segments and loss exposures within the consumer loan portfolios 
management s assessment of these factors support estimates for the allowance despite the decrease in loan losses in charge offs reflect the realization of losses in the portfolio that were estimated previously through provisions for credit losses 
loans charged off in decreased million to million 
net charge offs as a percent of average loans decreased to 
in as compared to 
in loans charged off in increased million as compared to loans charged off in decreased million over the provision for loan losses was significantly influenced by the level of net charge offs taken by promistar prior to its acquisition by the corporation 
the weak economy in south western pennsylvania  which existed in  and the overall economic climate subsequent to september resulted in deterioration in the credit quality of several significant commercial loans 
in addition  promistar began to experience credit quality deterioration within the indirect consumer auto loan portfolio as loan loss and delinquency trends increased 
as a result  promistar charged off million in loans and recorded a provision for loan losses of million during
