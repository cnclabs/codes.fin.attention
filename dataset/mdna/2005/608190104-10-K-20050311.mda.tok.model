critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates 
in reaching such decisions  the company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience 
actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
some of those significant accounting policies require the company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies 
accounts receivable and revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when goods are shipped and legal title passes to the customer 
the company provides allowances for expected cash discounts  returns  claims  and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluation of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market net realizable value 
cost is determined using the last in  first out method lifo for approximately of the inventory within the mohawk segment  which matches current costs with current revenues  and the first in  first out method fifo  which is used to value inventory within the dal tile segment and inventory not valued under the lifo method in the mohawk segment 
inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage  which is a function of historical usage and anticipated future selling price  in order to evaluate obsolescence  excessive quantities  and expected sales below cost 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to value obsolete  excessive inventory or inventory expected to be sold below cost and additional reserves may be required 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing 
the impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of the specified reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets based on management judgments and assumptions using estimated future cash flows 
these judgments and assumptions could materially change the value of the specified reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets and  therefore  could materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
the useful life of a definite intangible asset is based on assumptions and judgments made by management at the time of acquisition 
changes in these judgments and assumptions that could include a loss of customers  a change in the assessment of future operations or a prolonged economic downturn could materially change the value of the definite lived intangible assets and  therefore could materially impact the company s financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
additionally  taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with the company s tax treatment of certain items  and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward 
accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws  rules and regulations  each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner 
environmental and legal accruals are estimates based on judgments made by the company relating to ongoing environmental and legal proceedings  as disclosed in the company s consolidated financial statements 
in determining whether a liability is probable and reasonably estimable  the company consults with its internal experts 
the company believes that the amounts recorded in the accompanying financial statements are based on the best estimates and judgments available to it

the carpet and tile industry has experienced significant inflation in the prices of raw materials and fuel related costs beginning in the first quarter of for the period from through the carpet and tile industry experienced moderate inflation in the prices of raw materials and fuel related costs 
in the past  the company has generally passed along these price increases to its customers and has been able to enhance productivity to offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in both the united states and mexico 
seasonality the company is a calendar year end company and its results of operations for the first quarter tend to be the weakest 
the second  third and fourth quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating income 
these results are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns for floor covering  which historically have decreased during the first two months of each year following the holiday season 
certain factors affecting the company s performance in addition to the other information provided in this annual report on form k  the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an investment in shares of common stock 
if any of the events described in these risks were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the floor covering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions  such as consumer confidence and income  corporate and government spending  interest rate levels and demand for housing 
a prolonged decline in construction activity or spending for replacement floor covering products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the us floor covering industry is highly dependent on construction activity  including new construction  remodeling and replacement which are cyclical in nature 
although the impact of a decline in new construction activity is typically accompanied by an increase in remodeling and replacement activity  a prolonged decline in residential or commercial construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
additionally  economic changes that result in a prolonged decline in spending for remodeling and replacement activities could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the us construction industry has experienced significant downturns in the past  which have adversely affected suppliers to the industry 
the industry could experience similar downturns in the future  which could have a negative impact on the company s business 
the company faces intense competition in its industry  which could decrease demand for its products and could have a material adverse effect on its profitability 
the industry is highly competitive 
the company faces competition from a number of manufacturers and independent distributors 
some of its competitors may be larger and have greater resources and access to capital 
maintaining the company s competitive position may require substantial investments in its product development efforts  manufacturing facilities  distribution network and sales and marketing activities 
competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for its products 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company 
a failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates  to complete acquisitions and to integrate successfully the acquired operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
as part of its business strategy  the company intends to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses 
although it regularly evaluates acquisition opportunities  it may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms to fund acquisitions  complete acquisitions  or profitably manage acquired businesses 
acquired operations may not achieve expected performance levels and may involve a number of special risks  including among others an inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and the diversion of management resources 
the company may be unable to obtain raw materials on a timely basis  which could have a material adverse effect on its business 
the principal raw materials used in the company s manufacturing operations include nylon  polyester and polypropylene resins and fibers and carpet backings  which are used exclusively in its carpet and rugs business  talc  clay  nepheline syenite and various glazes  including frit ground glass  zircon and stains  which are used exclusively in its ceramic tile business  and other materials 
the company has a single source supplier for all of its nepheline syenite requirements 
an extended interruption in the supply of these or other raw materials used in the company s business or in the supply of suitable substitute materials would disrupt the company s operations  which could have a material adverse effect on its business 
the company may be unable to pass on to its customers increases in the costs of raw materials and energy  which could have a material adverse effect on its profitability 
the prices of raw materials and natural gas vary with market conditions 
although the company generally attempts to pass on increases in the costs of raw materials and natural gas to its customers  the company s ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase  competitive pressures and market conditions for its products 
there have been in the past  and may be in the future  periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered 
during such periods of time  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s profitability 
the company has been  and in the future may be  subject to claims and liabilities under environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  which could be significant 
the company s operations are subject to various environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  including those governing air emissions  wastewater discharges  and the use  storage  treatment and disposal of hazardous materials 
the applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment  to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts 
the company could incur material expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations  including fines and penalties 
the nature of the company s operations  including the potential discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions  exposes the company to the risk of claims under environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
the company could incur material costs or liabilities in connection with such claims 
changes in international trade laws and in the business  political and regulatory environment in mexico could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s monterrey  mexico manufacturing facility represents a significant portion of the company s total manufacturing capacity for ceramic tile 
accordingly  an event that has a material adverse impact on the company s mexican operations could have a material adverse effect on the tile operations as a whole 
the business  regulatory and political environments in mexico differ from those in the united states  and the company s mexican operations are exposed to legal  currency  tax  political  and economic risks specific to mexico 
the company could face increased competition as a result of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt and the north american free trade agreement nafta 
the company is uncertain what effect reduced import duties under gatt may have on its operations  although these reduced rates may stimulate additional competition from manufacturers that export ceramic tile to the united states 
although nafta lowers the tariffs imposed on the company s ceramic tile manufactured in mexico and sold in the united states and will eliminate such tariffs entirely on january   it may also stimulate competition in the united states and canada from manufacturers located in mexico 
forward looking information certain of the statements in this annual report on form k  particularly those anticipating future performance  business prospects  growth and operating strategies  proposed acquisitions  and similar matters  and those that include the words believes  anticipates  forecast  estimates or similar expressions constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
for those statements  mohawk claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of there can be no assurance that the forward looking statements will be accurate because they are based on many assumptions  which involve risks and uncertainties 
the following important factors could cause future results to differ changes in industry conditions  competition  raw material prices  timing and level of capital expenditures  integration of acquisitions  introduction of new products  rationalization of operations  and other risks identified in mohawk s sec reports and public announcements
