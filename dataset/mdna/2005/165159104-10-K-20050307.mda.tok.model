item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of business chesapeake is a leading european supplier of specialty value added paperboard packaging products and a leading international supplier of plastic packaging products to niche end use markets 
we focus on specific end use packaging markets  where customers demand creative designs  technical expertise and production capabilities that include broad geographic coverage and appropriate supply chain offerings 
chesapeake operates in two business segments paperboard packaging the paperboard packaging segment designs and manufactures folding cartons  leaflets  labels and other value added packaging products 
our primary end use markets are pharmaceutical and healthcare  international and branded products such as alcoholic drinks  confectioneries  cosmetics and fragrances  tobacco and food and household 
references to luxury packaging include the wine  champagne  cosmetics and fragrances packaging portion of the international and branded packaging markets 
plastic packaging the plastic packaging segment designs and manufactures plastic containers  bottles  preforms and closures 
the primary end use markets are agrochemicals and other specialty chemicals  and food and beverages 
our former land development segment owned real estate that we retained when we sold the timberland associated with our former pulp and paper operations because we believed this land was more valuable when sold for development or other uses 
the real estate was marketed to third parties for residential and commercial development  real estate investment and land conservation 
as of the end of the first quarter of  the remainder of the land development segment was liquidated and  as a result  this segment is now accounted for as a discontinued operation 
summary of overall results for were below management s initial expectations  due primarily to operational challenges from a competitive pricing environment  particularly in food and household packaging  and lower demand for international and branded packaging  particularly in the luxury packaging market and reduced volume in tobacco packaging from reduced shipments by our customers to asian markets 
start up costs of our two new plants in germany and incremental manufacturing costs related to the installation of new equipment at multiple locations negatively impacted results across the paperboard packaging segment in however  we believe we are making good progress in resolving these issues 
these decreases were partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation rates  a strong performance in the plastic packaging segment and good internal growth in the pharmaceutical and healthcare packaging market 
at december   chesapeake had significant debt maturing in the first half of in  we refinanced a substantial portion of this debt before its maturity dates  which lengthened our maturity schedule and lowered our overall cost of capital while enhancing our financial flexibility 
in february  the first phase of our refinancing was completed when we entered into an amended and restated senior credit facility maturing in see liquidity and capital resources financing 
in march  we completed the sale of million shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share 
in april  the underwriters of the common stock offering partially exercised their over allotment option and acquired an additional million shares at an offering price of per share 
our net proceeds after deducting discounts  commissions and expenses were million 
we used the net proceeds to redeem approximately million principal amount of our outstanding senior subordinated notes due and to 
table of contents repay outstanding borrowings under our senior bank credit facility 
the redemption resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of million 
see liquidity and capital resources financing we believe the equity offering  and the use of the net proceeds thereof  strengthens our balance sheet  improves our liquidity and will move us closer to achieving our longer term goal of attaining an investment grade credit rating 
in december  we completed a public offering of million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due our net proceeds from the sale of these notes  after deducting discounts  commissions and expenses  were approximately million using an exchange rate of to 
the net proceeds from the sale of these notes were used to retire million principal amount of our outstanding million aggregate principal amount of notes due march the retirement of these notes was accomplished through a tender offer and consent solicitation 
including fees  expenses  interest and premiums  the redemption cost million 
in connection with the tender offer  the company incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of million 
the remaining net proceeds of approximately million were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our senior bank credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
review of consolidated results of operations the following consolidated results from continuing operations highlight major year to year changes in our income statement see page for a discussion of discontinued operations 
more detail regarding these changes is found under the caption review of segment results 
all per share amounts included in this management s discussion and analysis are presented on a diluted basis 
the consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with united states us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and require management to make extensive use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures see discussion of critical accounting policies starting on page 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
income from continuing operations before interest  extinguishment of debt  and taxes is abbreviated as ebit 
segment ebit excludes any restructuring charges and gains on sales of businesses 
excluding these amounts from our calculation of segment ebit is consistent with how our management reviews segment performance and  we believe  affords the reader consistent measures of our operating performance 
ebit is not  however  intended as an alternative measure of operating results as determined in accordance with gaap 
our definition of ebit is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures for other companies

the tobacco packaging market experienced a decline in sales volume primarily related to decreased exports to the asian markets  a fire at one of our food and household plants contributed to reduced sales volume in that market  and  in the international and branded packaging market  record summer temperatures in europe depressed the volume of confectionery cartons  and demand for alcoholic drink cartons remained sluggish resulting from reduced international travel 
these decreases were partially offset by improved sales volume in the pharmaceutical and healthcare packaging market for compared to ebit decreased percent in compared to the net decrease in ebit was partially due to increased costs of approximately million for pension and insurance costs 
the remaining decrease in ebit was due to a combination of factors 
the sales volume declines in tobacco exports and international and branded packaging contributed to reduced profitability in the paperboard packaging segment 
in addition  the pharmaceutical and healthcare sector has seen lower margins as a result of a less favorable product mix and start up expenses associated with a major product launch

guarantees and indemnifications we have entered into agreements for the sale of assets or businesses that contain provisions in which we agree to indemnify the buyers or third parties involved in the sale for certain liabilities or risks related to the sale 
in these sale agreements  we typically agree to indemnify the buyers or other involved third parties against a broadly defined range of potential losses typically including  but not limited to  claims  costs  damages  judgments  liabilities  fines or penalties  and attorneys fees arising from i a breach of our representations or warranties in the sale agreement or ancillary documents  ii our failure to perform any of the covenants or obligations of the sale agreement or ancillary documents  and iii other liabilities expressly retained or assumed by us related to the sale 
most of our indemnity obligations under these sale agreements are i limited to a maximum dollar value significantly less than the final purchase price  ii limited by time within which indemnification claims must be asserted often between one and three years  and iii subject to a deductible or basket 
many of the potential indemnification liabilities under these sale agreements are unknown  remote or highly contingent  and most are unlikely to ever require an indemnity payment 
furthermore  even in the event that an indemnification claim is asserted  liability for indemnification is subject to determination under the terms of the applicable sale agreement  and any payments may be limited or barred by a monetary cap  a time limitation  or a deductible or basket 
for these reasons  we are unable to estimate the maximum potential amount of the potential future liability under the indemnity provisions of the sale agreements

such matters are discussed in note commitments and contingencies of item  incorporated herein by reference

risk management because we currently conduct a significant amount of our business internationally  fluctuations in currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets may have a significant impact on our financial statements 
currency fluctuations have much less effect on local operating results  because we mostly sell our products in the same currency used to pay local operating costs 
our currency exposures are cash  debt and foreign currency transactions denominated primarily in the british pound  the euro and the south african rand 
we manage our foreign currency exposures primarily by funding certain foreign currency denominated assets with liabilities in the same currency and  as such  certain exposures are naturally offset 
the million senior notes issued in december of have been effectively designated as a hedge of our net investment in euro functional currency 
table of contents subsidiaries 
at january   million related to the revaluation of the debt from euro to us dollars was included as a charge to cumulative translation adjustment 
as part of managing our foreign currency exposures  we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts for transactions that are not denominated in the local currency 
the use of these agreements allows us to reduce our overall exposure to exchange rate fluctuations  as the gains and losses on the agreements substantially offset the gains and losses on the transactions being hedged 
forward exchange agreements are viewed as risk management tools  involve little complexity and  in accordance with company policy  are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
in  chesapeake entered into a foreign currency forward exchange contract in a notional principal amount of million and having a fair market value liability of million at january  the contract matures in chesapeake is not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
chesapeake has entered into interest rate swaps to convert floating interest rate debt to fixed rate debt and vice versa and to obtain an acceptable level of interest rate risk 
amounts currently due to  or from  interest swap counterparties are recorded in interest expense in the period they accrue 
the related amounts payable to  or receivable from  the counterparties are included in other accrued liabilities 
at january   and december   we had interest rate swap agreements outstanding with notional principal amounts of million and million  respectively  and a fair market value asset liability of approximately million and million  respectively 
in january  chesapeake terminated an interest rate swap and received a cash settlement from the counterparty of million 
of this amount  approximately million will be recognized as an interest rate yield adjustment over the remaining life of the underlying debt 
the remaining interest rate swap agreement matures in  and its weighted average pay rate and receive rate were percent and percent  respectively  for the year ended january  at january   seven percent of our debt portfolio consisted of variable rate debt including debt that is the subject of interest rate swaps 
a sensitivity analysis to measure potential changes in the interest expense from a change in interest rates indicated that a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would have changed our annual interest expense by million for and million for our cash position includes amounts denominated in foreign currencies 
we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds held by our subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness with which these funds can be accessed 
the repatriation of cash balances from some of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences 
we have examined the potential impact of the american jobs creation act of signed into law in october and have determined it does not provide a tax advantage to us 
chesapeake continually evaluates risk retention and insurance levels for product liability  property damage and other potential exposures to risk 
we devote significant effort to maintaining and improving safety and internal control programs  which are intended to reduce our exposure to certain risks 
management determines the amount of insurance coverage to purchase and the appropriate amount of risk to retain based on the cost and availability of insurance and the likelihood of a loss 
management believes that the current levels of risk retention are consistent with those of comparable companies in the industries in which chesapeake operates 
there can be no assurance that chesapeake will not incur losses beyond the limits  or outside the coverage  of our insurance 
however  our liquidity  financial position and profitability are not expected to be materially affected by the levels of risk retention that we accept 
critical accounting policies we describe the significant accounting policies employed in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto within the footnotes 
chesapeake s consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with gaap 
gaap sometimes permits more than one method of accounting to be used 
in addition  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
judgments and assessments of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas 
reported results could have been materially different under a different set of assumptions and estimates 
the following summary provides further information about the critical accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the consistent 
table of contents application of our policies provides readers of chesapeake s financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with our board of directors and audit committee 
goodwill and other long lived asset valuations management uses judgment to assess whether current events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill and other long lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable 
management performs impairment tests that require estimates of factors such as sales volume  pricing  inflation  discount rates  exchange rates  asset remaining lives and capital spending 
these projections are necessarily dependent upon assumptions about our performance and the economy in general and could change significantly from period to period 
assumptions used are consistent with our internal planning 
if assumptions and estimates change  it could result in non cash charges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  management reviews the recorded value of our goodwill annually  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value 
with the assistance of a third party valuation firm  fair value of our reporting units was determined using a discounted cash flow model and confirmed using a guideline public companies model  which uses peer group metrics to value a company 
we performed our annual evaluation of goodwill for our reporting units as of december  based on our analysis  we concluded that our goodwill is realizable 
if the cost of capital used in the analyses was basis points higher  our goodwill would still have been realizable 
the carrying value of long lived assets other than goodwill is evaluated when certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value 
the fair value is calculated using expected cash flows produced by the asset  or the appropriate grouping of assets  over the remaining life of such assets and its eventual disposition 
if the undiscounted projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount  an impairment would be recognized 
environmental and other contingencies in accordance with gaap  management recognizes a liability for environmental remediation and litigation costs when it believes it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
due to the wide range of possible outcomes of any environmental obligation  significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of the environmental accrual 
management must make estimates on items such as the remediation and restoration costs based on the estimated contamination levels 
future expenditures for environmental obligations are not discounted unless the aggregate amount of the obligations  and the amount and timing of the cash payments  are fixed and readily determinable 
the accrual is not reduced for any possible future insurance or indemnification recoveries 
we periodically review the status of all significant existing or potential environmental issues and adjust our accrual as necessary 
if any of the estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  or if actual outcomes are different than our estimates  we may be required to record material adjustments to the accrual 
pension and other postretirement employee benefits we have significant pension and postretirement benefit costs and credits that are developed from actuarial valuations 
the actuarial valuations employ key assumptions that are particularly important when determining our projected liabilities for pension and other postretirement employee benefits 
payments made by chesapeake related to these benefits will be made over a lengthy period and the projected liability will be affected by assumptions regarding inflation  investment returns and market interest rates  changes in the numbers of plan participants and changes in the benefit obligations and laws and regulations covering the benefit obligation 
the key assumptions used in developing our fiscal balances are detailed in note employee retirement and postretirement benefits of item  incorporated herein by reference 
discount rates are used to determine the present value of 
table of contents future payments 
in general  our liability increases as the discount rate decreases and vice versa 
a lower expected return on plan assets increases the amount of pension expense and vice versa 
decreases in the level of actual plan assets will also serve to increase the amount of pension expense 
pension expense and liabilities would be higher with a higher compensation increase 
management develops assumptions with the assistance of independent actuaries 
discount rates are determined from analyses provided by the actuary of aa rated bonds with cash flows matching the expected payments to be made under the plans 
if the discount rate used in the valuation were decreased by basis points  our projected benefit obligation would have increased by approximately million at january   and the pension expense would increase by million 
if the discount rate were increased by basis points  our projected benefit obligation would have decreased by approximately million at january   and the pension expense would decrease by million 
to improve the funded status of our pension plans  we increased employer cash contributions by million in over the required contribution  and we anticipate funding to be approximately million above required levels 
we also expect pension expense in to increase by approximately million over levels 
the estimated accumulated benefit obligation abo related to certain of our pension plans exceeded the fair value of those plan assets at january  due to the additional contributions in  this deficit was lower than in and we were required to reduce our minimum liability by recording an after tax million adjustment to equity 
market conditions and interest rates significantly impact future assets and liabilities of our pension plans  and could impact funding and charges in the future see note employee retirement and postretirement benefits of item  incorporated herein by reference 
we annually re evaluate our assumptions used in projecting pension and other postretirement liabilities and associated expense 
had we used different assumptions in calculating the liabilities  the carrying value of the liabilities and the impact on net earnings may have been different 
deferred tax assets many deductions for tax return purposes cannot be taken until the expenses are actually paid  rather than when the expenses are recorded under gaap 
also  certain tax credits and tax loss carryforwards cannot be used until future periods when sufficient taxable income is generated 
in these circumstances  under gaap  companies accrue for the tax benefit expected to be received in future years if  in the judgment of management  it is more likely than not that the company will receive such benefits 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews our judgment regarding the likelihood the benefits of a deferred tax asset will be realized 
during the periodic reviews  management must consider a variety of factors  including the nature and amount of the tax income and expense items  the anticipated timing of the ability to utilize the asset  the current tax statutes and the projected future earnings 
if management determines it is no longer more likely than not that an asset will be utilized  an offsetting valuation reserve would be recorded to reduce the asset and net earnings in that period

fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  which superseded fasb staff position no 
 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act provides prescription drug benefits to retirees under medicare part d and provides subsidies to plan sponsors providing certain prescription drug benefits if they are determined to be actuarially equivalent to those under medicare 
fsp provides guidance on accounting for the effects of the act and requires certain disclosures 
we adopted fsp as of july  based on actuarial estimates of the impact of the act on chesapeake  the act is not material to chesapeake 
we incorporated the effects of the act into the valuation of our postretirement healthcare plans performed at the regular measurement date of september  see note summary of significant accounting policies new accounting pronouncements of item  incorporated herein by reference  for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements
