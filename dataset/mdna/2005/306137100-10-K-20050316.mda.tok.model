investors are cautioned that any forward lookin g statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve significan t risks and uncertainties  and that actual results may differ materially fro m those projected in the forward looking statements 
the following discussio n should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes t o those financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
overview in  we continued our growth and we had our first profitabl e quarter 
our revenues for the full year increased to million from million in we are pleased that we were profitable in the fourth quarter o f however  our focus will continue to be on managing our business with a view towards long term success and growth 
to this end  in we continued t o invest in research and development and other areas to position the company fo r future growth 
we will continue to invest in these areas in and anticipat e that our research and development expenses will increase in to continue to create industry leading cutting edge network storag e solutions  we hired additional software development engineers and qualit y assurance engineers 
these software engineers design and test the softwar e products that are or will be sold by our oem partners and resellers 
continuin g to deliver products to meet the demands of the storage market is necessary fo r us to remain competitive and to continue our growth 
it is important to our success that our products meet the needs of en d users and that our products are and are viewed by the market to be innovative 
in  our products received recognition for their quality an d innovation from several respected  independent  industry publications an d organizations 
this recognition helps us gain access to additional customers an d assists us in closing sales 
we also increased our sales force and our technical support team 
a n increased sales force should expand the market exposure for our products 
th e expanded technical support team responds to questions and technical issues fro m end users of our products and from our resellers and oem partners 
providing to p notch technical support to these groups enhances our ability to continue to mak e sales 
end users who are satisfied with our technical support are more likely t o order additional products from us 
resellers and oem partners who are happy wit h our technical support  and whose end users are satisfied  will be more likely t o recommend our current products and less likely to consider other providers fo r future products 
the key factors we look to for our future business prospects continu e to be our sales pipeline  our ability to establish and expand relationships wit h key industry oems and resellers  sales by our oem partners  additional order s from resellers  growth in deferred revenue  re orders from existing customers and the growth of the overall market for storage solutions 
gross margins ar e also a key factor in evidencing the growth of our business 
our sales pipeline consists of inquiries from end users and reseller s for possible purchases of our products 
our overall sales pipeline steadil y increased for each quarter of compared with the same quarter in oem relationships are important to us for two main reasons 
first sales by our oem partners contribute to our revenues 
second  having ou r products selected by respected  established industry leaders signals t o potential customers  resellers and other potential oem partners that ou r products are quality products that add value to their enterprise 
befor e licensing software  oem partners typically undertake broad reviews of all of th e competing software solutions available 
the choice of ipstor by major industr y participants validates the design and the capabilities of our products 
overall  product licenses to oems accounted for approximately thirt y percent of our revenues in one oem customer accounted for over ten percen t of our revenues 
we anticipate that oems will account for thirty to fort y percent of our revenues in we expect that at least one oem will accoun t for at least ten percent of our revenues in accordingly  the loss of thi s customer would have a material adverse effect on our business 
in  we signed a new agreement for our iscsi server for window s storage server wss powered by ipstor with a tier oem 
this product which is private labeled by the oem  began shipping towards the end of i n addition  a tier oem with whom we signed an agreement in began shipping a private labeled storage solution utilizing our virtualtape library software i n the second quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we also signed a n agreement with an oem partner for non enterprise storage solutions 
these oem relationships are in addition to the oem partnerships w e already had with cnt  maxxan and storagetek  among others 
we will continue t o seek additional oem opportunities in the future 
we were disappointed that an oem with whom we signed an agreement i n did not launch their solution as planned in this decision  which w e were informed by the oem was not related to any problems with our software caused us to have lower than expected revenues for we do everything we ca n to assure that our products meet the needs of our oem partners and thei r customers 
however  we cannot control decisions by our oem partners to chang e their product or marketing mix in ways that impact sales of products licensed b y the oems from us 
many enterprises look to value added resellers or solution providers t o assist them in making their information technology purchases 
these reseller s typically review an enterprise s needs and suggest a hardware  software  o r combined hardware and software solution to fulfill the enterprise s requirements 
resellers have wide choices in fulfilling their customers needs we have established strong relationships with many premier resellers 
in we signed agreements with many new resellers worldwide 
we also terminate d relationships with several resellers who we believed were not properly sellin g our products 
we will continue to enter into relationships with resellers and t o discontinue relationships with resellers with whom we are not satisfied 
as service providers to companies  resellers reputations are dependen t on satisfying their customers needs efficiently and effectively 
if reseller s determine that a product they have been providing to their customers is no t functioning as promised or is not providing adequate return on investment  or i f the customers are complaining about the level of support they are receiving fro m the suppliers  the resellers will move quickly to offer different solutions t o their customers 
additional sales by resellers are therefore an importan t indicator of our business prospects 
we saw growth in the sales by most of ou r significant resellers in and expect that this growth will continue in our deferred revenues consist primarily of revenue attributable t o support and maintenance of our products 
the level of deferred revenue is a n important indicator of our success 
maintenance and support for our products i s sold for fixed periods of time 
maintenance and support agreements are typicall y for one year  although some agreements are for terms in excess of one year 
i f we do not deliver the support needed by end users of our products or by our oe m partners and resellers  then they will not renew their maintenance and suppor t agreements 
if end users stop using our products  they also will not renew thei r maintenance and support agreements 
an increase in deferred revenues thu s indicates growth in our installed base and end user and oem satisfaction wit h our maintenance and support services 
our deferred revenue increased to million as of december   compared with million as of december we expect deferred revenue to continue to grow in the level of re orders from existing end users of our products i s another measure of customer satisfaction 
information technology professional s will only order additional products and services for their companies if the y determine that the products have reduced total cost of ownership and hav e provided a good return on investment 
re orders are thus an indication that ou r products are delivering as promised and that our support is meeting the en d user s needs 
in  many end users ordered additional copies of ipstor additional products or ordered additional options 
if re orders decline  i t would indicate that future sales might also decline 
as the percentage of ou r revenues from oems increases  the analytical value of re orders decrease s because our oem partners typically do not provide us with informatio n identifying the end user for each order 
the storage solutions market continues to grow 
please see th e discussion on page as we predicted last year  in addition to growth based o n demand for storage server consolidation and replication  there was growth i n backup acceleration 
we expect each of these areas to continue growing in in addition  we have announced new initiatives in the small medium busines s smb and small office home office soho markets 
we believe that thes e non enterprise markets are another growth area for storage software 
one area of particular growth in that we expect to continue  i f not accelerate  in  was in virtualtape library software 
prices for dis k storage continue to fall  and the need for rapid back up  disaster recovery an d regulatory compliance continues to grow 
as we expected  saw the beginning of market acceptance of ip base d storage area networks  primarily using iscsi 
previously  most sans had bee n based on fibre channel 
in addition to the solution offered by our tier oe m partner  we plan to continue to tap into the growth in this market through sale s of our products by other strategic partners 
another important measure of our business is gross margin 
among othe r things  gross margin measures our ability to scale our business 
unlik e manufacturers of hardware  our incremental cost for each additional unit o f software licensed is a small percentage of the software license revenue 
thus our gross margins tend to increase as our software license revenue increases 
w e incur research and development expenses before the product is offered fo r licensing 
these expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for engineerin g and testing  but also include other items such as the cost of hardware an d software used in development 
we also have expenses for sales and marketing  an d general and administrative functions 
our gross margin continued to increase in  ending at for th e fourth quarter of  compared with for the fourth quarter of thi s demonstrates that we were successful in containing the growth of our costs eve n as our revenue increased 
we are pleased with our ability to contain the growth of expenses i n there were two large expense items in which we had not anticipated first  we were subject to a claim that some of our products infringed a paten t issued to a third party 
while we denied  and continue to deny  that  if th e subject patent is valid  our products infringe the patent  the defense an d settlement of the claim was expensive 
as part of the settlement  we made a one time payment of million 
in addition  we incurred over million i n related legal expenses 
the need to defend our products against these types o f claims could result in higher expenses in the future 
second  we incurred significant expenses related to compliance with th e provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of this act requires  among othe r things  an annual review of internal controls by the company and our auditors the costs associated with this review  including the cost of an outsid e consultant and the cost of the review by our auditors  approximated millio n in while we believe these costs will be reduced in the future  there wil l be continuing costs related to compliance with the act in and beyond 
one additional factor that we expect to affect our revenues on a quarterly  but not annual  basis  is the seasonality of the informatio n technology business 
historically  information technology spending has bee n higher in the fourth and second quarters of each calendar year  and somewha t slower in the other quarters  particularly the first quarter 
our quarterl y results were impacted by this seasonality in  and we anticipate that ou r quarterly results for will be affected as well 
our critical accounting policies are those related to revenu e recognition and accounts receivable allowances 
as described in note to ou r consolidated financial statements  we recognize revenue in accordance with th e provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition  a s amended 
software license revenue is recognized only when pervasive evidence o f an arrangement exists and the fee is fixed and determinable  among othe r criteria 
an arrangement is evidenced by a signed customer contract fo r nonrefundable royalty advances received from oems or a customer purchase orde r or a royalty report summarizing software licenses sold for each software licens e resold by an oem  distributor or solution provider to an end user 
the softwar e license fees are fixed and determinable as our standard payment terms range fro m to days  depending on regional billing practices  and we have not provide d any of our customers extended payment terms 
when a customer licenses softwar e together with the purchase of maintenance  we allocate a portion of the fee t o maintenance for its fair value based on the contractual maintenance renewa l rate 
we review accounts receivable to determine which are doubtful o f collection 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance fo r uncollectible accounts and returns  we consider historical return rates specific past due accounts  analysis of our accounts receivable aging  custome r payment terms  historical collections  write offs and returns  changes i n customer demand and relationships  concentrations of credit risk and custome r credit worthiness 
historically  we have experienced a somewhat consistent leve l of write offs and returns as a percentage of revenue due to our customer relationships  contract provisions and credit assessments 
changes in th e product return rates  credit worthiness of customers  general economi c conditions and other factors may impact the level of future write offs  revenue s and our general and administrative expenses 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to th e year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  ou r operating expenses increased from million in to million i n net loss decreased from million in to million in the increase in revenues was mainly due to an increase in demand for our networ k storage solution software  the introduction of our new products and th e successful launch by one of our oems of a solution powered by our product revenue contribution from our oem partners increased in absolute dollars and a s a percentage of our total revenue for the year ended december  revenu e from resellers and distributors also increased in absolute dollars 
expense s increased in all aspects of our business to support our growth 
in november we moved our headquarters to a larger facility and  for the year ende d december   we increased the number of employees and continued to inves t in infrastructure by purchasing additional computers and equipment 
we increase d the number of employees from employees as of december  to employees as of december  included in our results for the year ende d december  is a litigation settlement charge of million and lega l fees of million  each associated with litigation relating to paten t infringement that was resolved in the third quarter of  as well as million of costs related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of revenues software license revenue software license revenue is comprised of software licenses sold throug h our oems  value added resellers and distributors to end users and  to a lesse r extent  directly to end users 
these revenues are recognized when  among othe r requirements  we receive a customer purchase order or a royalty repor t summarizing software licenses sold and the software and permanent key codes ar e delivered to the customer 
we also receive nonrefundable royalty advances an d engineering fees from some of our oem partners 
these arrangements are evidence d by a signed customer contract  and the revenue is recognized when the softwar e product master is delivered and accepted  and the engineering services  if any have been performed 
software license revenue increased to million in fro m million in increased market acceptance and demand for our product the introduction of our new products and the successful launch by one of ou r oems of a solution powered by our product were the primary drivers of th e increase in software license revenue 
software license revenue increased fro m both our oem partners and from our resellers 
revenue from our oem partner s increased as a percentage of total revenue 
we expect our software licens e revenue to continue to grow and the percentage of future software licens e revenue derived from our oem partners to increase 
maintenance  software services and other revenue maintenance  software services and other revenues are comprised o f software maintenance and technical support  professional services primaril y related to the implementation of our software  engineering services  and sale s of computer hardware 
revenue derived from maintenance and technical suppor t contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual maintenanc e term 
professional services revenue is recognized in the period that the relate d services are performed 
revenue from engineering services is primarily relate d to customizing software product masters for some of our oem partners 
revenu e from engineering services is recognized in the period the services ar e completed 
in and  we had a limited number of transactions in which w e purchased hardware and bundled this hardware with our software and sold th e bundled solution to a customer 
a portion of the contractual fee is recognized as revenue when the hardware or software is delivered to the customer based o n the relative fair value of the delivered element s 
through december  the software and hardware in bundled solutions have been delivered to th e customer in the same quarter 
maintenance  software services and other revenu e increased to million in from million in the major factor contributing to the increase in maintenance  softwar e services and other revenue was the increase in the number of maintenance an d technical support contracts we sold 
as we are in business longer  and as w e license more software  we expect these revenues will continue to increase 
th e majority of our new customers purchase maintenance and support and mos t customers renew their maintenance and support after their initial contract s expire 
maintenance revenue increased from million for the year ende d december  to million for the year ended december  growt h in our professional services revenue  which increased from million in to million in  also contributed to the increase in software service s and other revenues 
this increase in professional services revenue was relate d to the increase in our software license customers that elected to purchas e professional services 
additionally  our hardware sales increased from million in to million in this increase was the result of a n increase in demand from our customers for bundled solutions 
we expec t maintenance  software services and other revenues to continue to increase 
cost of revenues amortization of purchased and capitalized software to remain successful in the network storage solutions market  we mus t continually upgrade our software by enhancing the existing features of ou r products and by adding new features and products 
we often evaluate whether t o develop these new offerings in house or whether we can achieve a greater retur n on investment by purchasing or licensing software from third parties 
based o n our evaluations  we have purchased or licensed various software for resale sinc e as of december  and  we had million of purchase d software licenses that are being amortized over three years 
for the years ende d december  and  we recorded million of amortization related t o these purchased software licenses 
we will continue to evaluate third part y software licenses and may make additional purchases  which would result in a n increase in amortization expense 
the company did not capitalize any software development costs until ou r initial product reached technological feasibility in march at that point we capitalized million of software development costs  which were bein g amortized at the greater of straight line over three years or the ratio o f current revenue of the related products to total current and anticipated futur e revenue of these products 
amortization of capitalized software was  an d  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue consist s primarily of personnel costs and other costs associated with providing softwar e implementations  technical support under maintenance contracts  and training cost of maintenance  software services and other revenues also includes the cos t of hardware purchased that was resold 
cost of maintenance  software service s and other revenues for the year ended december  increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  th e increase in cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue wa s principally due to an increase in personnel 
as a result of our increased sale s of maintenance and support contracts and professional services  we required a higher number of employees to provide technical support and to implement ou r software 
our cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue wil l continue to grow in absolute dollars as our revenue increases 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million o r of revenues compared to million or of revenues for the year ende d december  the increase in gross profit and gross margin was directl y related to the increase in revenues relative to the increase in expenses 
as ou r software license revenues increase  the associated costs as a percentage of those revenues tend to decrease 
additionally  the increased percentage o f revenue from our oem partners in contributed to the increase in gros s margin since revenues from our oem partners have higher gross margins 
software development costs software development costs consist primarily of personnel costs fo r product development personnel and other related costs associated with th e development of new products  enhancements to existing products  qualit y assurance and testing 
software development costs increased to millio n in from million in the increase in software development cost s was primarily due to an increase in employees required to enhance and test ou r network storage software products  as well as to develop new innovative feature s and options 
in addition  as we entered into agreements with new oem partners we required additional employees to test and integrate our software with our oe m partners products 
in  we also opened a development office in china t o assist in our development work 
we intend to continue recruiting and hirin g product development personnel to support our development process 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of sales and marketin g personnel and related costs  travel  public relations expense  marketin g literature and promotions  commissions  trade show expenses  and the cost s associated with our foreign sales offices 
selling and marketing expense s increased to million in from million in as a resul t of the increase in revenue and interest in our software  our commission expens e and travel expenses increased 
in addition  we continued to hire new sales an d sales support personnel and to expand our worldwide presence to accommodate ou r revenue growth 
we believe that to continue to grow sales  our sales an d marketing expenses will continue to increase 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personne l costs of general and administrative functions  public company related costs directors and officers insurance  legal and professional fees and other genera l corporate overhead costs 
general and administrative expenses increased t o million in from million in the increase in general an d administrative expenses was partially due to a million increase in lega l expense attributable to litigation relating to alleged patent infringement wit h dot hill systems corporation dot hill and crossroads systems texas  inc crossroads 
expenses of million for the year ended december  related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and a n increase in the number employees also contributed to the increase in general an d administrative expenses 
litigation settlement charge during the third quarter of  we resolved claims relating t o alleged patent infringement brought by dot hill and by crossroads against us i n the united states district court for the western district of texas 
pursuant t o the terms of the settlement agreement between crossroads and us  we  withou t admission of infringement  made a one time payment of million and grante d to crossroads licenses to certain of our technology in exchange for a worldwide perpetual license to the technology underlying the crossroads patents at issu e in the litigation 
all claims against us by both dot hill and crossroads hav e now been dismissed 
interest and other income we invest our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities i n government securities and other low risk investments 
interest and other incom e decreased to million in from million in this decreas e in interest income was due to lower interest rates and lower average cash  cas h equivalent and marketable securities balances 
income taxes we did not record a tax benefit associated with the pre tax los s incurred from the period from inception february  through december  as we deemed that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset s will not be realized based on our early stage of operations 
accordingly  w e provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
ou r income tax provision consists of tax liabilities related to our foreig n subsidiaries 
lease abandonment charge in november  we relocated our headquarters to a larger facility t o accommodate our future growth 
as a result of this relocation  we vacated ou r previous office space and recorded a charge for the estimated loss we expect t o incur on the remaining lease obligation 
the charge of million included th e remaining lease rental obligation reduced by cash flows we expect to generat e from an agreement to sub lease the facility as well as the write off o f leasehold improvements at our previous facility 
this expense is not expected t o recur 
impairment of long lived and other assets in october  we entered into an agreement with network securit y solutions  inc nssi  a publicly traded company  whereby million wa s paid to nssi  of which million was for the purchase of convertibl e preferred stock of nssi accounted for under the cost method  and millio n was for a non refundable prepaid royalty recoupable against future product sale s of nssi s product 
primarily due to the decline in the market value of nssi s common stock underlying the convertible preferred stock significantly below th e company s cost  we concluded in that the decline in the fair value of ou r investment in nssi s preferred stock was other than temporary 
accordingly  i n we recorded an impairment charge to write off our investment in nss i preferred stock 
in addition  due to the lack of market acceptance of the nss i product  we concluded that the unrecouped prepaid royalty was not recoverabl e and it was written off 
as a result  in  we recorded a million charg e for the impairment of long lived and other assets related to our nssi agreement of which million was an operating expense 
in  we received a paymen t from nssi of  in exchange for all of our preferred stock of nssi  whic h was reflected as a reduction to the impairment charge in the statement o f operations 
we do not expect to incur any additional expenses from thi s investment 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to th e year ended december  revenues software license revenue software license revenue increased to million in fro m million in increased market acceptance and demand for our produc t were the primary drivers of the increase in software license revenue 
a continued increase in the number of our channel partners and oems also helpe d increase our revenues 
maintenance  software services and other revenue maintenance  software services and other revenue increased to million in from million in the major factor behind the increas e in maintenance  software services and other revenue was an increase in th e number of maintenance and technical support contracts we sold 
as we are i n business longer  and as we license more software  we expect these revenues wil l continue to increase 
the majority of our new customers purchase maintenance an d support and most customers renew their maintenance and support after thei r initial contracts expire 
maintenance revenue increased from million fo r the year ended december  to million for the year ended december growth in our professional services sales  which increased from million in to million in  also contributed to the increase i n software services and other revenues 
this increase in professional service s revenue was related to the increase in our software license customers tha t elected to purchase professional services 
additionally  our hardware sale s increased from million in to million in this increase wa s the result of an increase in demand from our customers for bundled solutions 
cost of revenues amortization of purchased and capitalized software amortization of purchased and capitalized software increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ende d december  the increase in amortization expense was due to our purchas e of an additional million of software licenses in as of december  we had million of purchased software licenses that are bein g amortized over three years 
for the year ended december   we recorde d million of amortization related to these purchased software licenses 
as o f december   we had million of purchased software licenses an d recorded approximately million of amortization for the year ended decembe r  related to these purchased software licenses 
amortization o f capitalized software was  and  for the years ended december and  respectively 
cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue cost of maintenance  software services and other revenues for the yea r ended december  increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cost o f maintenance  software services and other revenue was primarily driven by a n increase in hardware sales 
as we sold more hardware  our hardware costs fo r resale rose from million in to million in the increase i n cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue was also due to a n increase in personnel 
as a result of our increased sales of maintenance an d support contracts and professional services  we required a higher number o f employees to provide technical support and to implement our software 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million o r of revenues compared to million or of revenues for the year ende d december  the increase in gross profit was directly related to th e increase in revenues 
the decrease in gross margins was due to the increase i n amortization of purchased software licenses and was also partially related t o margins on hardware sales  which are typically lower than the margins o n software and services 
software development costs software development costs increased to million in fro m million in the increase in software development costs was primaril y due to an increase in employees required to enhance and test our core networ k storage software product  as well as to develop new innovative features an d options 
in addition  as we negotiated and signed new oem partners  we require d additional employees to test and customize our software with our oem partners products 
in  we also opened a development office in china to assist in ou r development work 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in as a result of the increase in revenue and interes t in our software  our commission expense and travel expenses increased 
i n addition  we continued to hire new sales and sales support personnel and t o expand our worldwide presence to accommodate our revenue growth 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million i n from million in one reason for the increase in general an d administrative expenses is due to an increase in salaries 
as our business grew we required additional general and administrative personnel to support th e growth 
another reason for the increase was due to higher premiums for ou r directors and officers insurance 
interest and other income interest and other income decreased to million in fro m million in this decrease in interest income was due to lower interes t rates and lower average cash  cash equivalent and marketable securitie s balances 
income taxes we did not record a tax benefit associated with the pre tax los s incurred from the period from inception february  through december  as we deemed that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset s will not be realized based on our early stage of operations 
accordingly  w e provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets

the charge of million included th e remaining lease rental obligation reduced by cash flows we expect to generat e from an agreement to sub lease the facility as well as the write off o f leasehold improvements at our previous facility 
impairment of long lived and other assets in october  we entered into an agreement with network securit y solutions  inc nssi  a publicly traded company  whereby million wa s paid to nssi  of which million was for the purchase of convertibl e preferred stock of nssi accounted for under the cost method  and millio n was for a non refundable prepaid royalty recoupable against future product sale s of nssi s product

in  we received a paymen t from nssi of  in exchange for all of our preferred stock of nssi  whic h was reflected as a reduction to the impairment charge in the statement o f operations 
we do not expect to incur any additional expenses from thi s investment 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents totaled million and marketabl e securities totaled million at december  as of december  we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketabl e securities 
the reasons for this decrease in cash and cash equivalents an d marketable securities are discussed below 
because we have not yet bee n profitable on a full year basis  the major use of our cash has been to fun d operations 
until we reach profitability on a full year basis  we will continu e to use our cash and marketable securities to fund operations 
in  we made investments in our infrastructure to support ou r long term growth 
we increased the total number of employees in and mad e investments in property and equipment to support our growth 
as we continue t o grow  we will continue to make investments in property and equipment and wil l need to continue to increase our headcount 
in the past  we have also used cas h to purchase software licenses and to make acquisitions 
we will continue t o evaluate potential software license purchases and acquisitions and if the righ t opportunity presents itself we may continue to use our cash for these purposes however  as of the date of this filing  we have no agreements  commitments o r understandings with respect to any such acquisitions 
in  we also used cas h to defend and settle a patent infringement litigation 
the patent litigatio n settlement charge was million and we also incurred approximately million in legal fees associated with this litigation 
if any future patent infringement litigation is brought against us  we may have to incur simila r types of expenses 
additionally  in we incurred approximately millio n in professional fees associated with the sarbanes oxley act of compliance although the fees may be lower in  we will continue to incur professiona l fees to ensure that we are in compliance with that act 
we currently do not have any debt and our only significant commitment s are related to our office leases 
in connection with our acquisition of ip metrics in july  we wer e required to make cash payments to the former shareholders of ip metrics  whic h were contingent on the level of revenues from ip metrics products for a perio d of twenty four months through june  in  we made payments to th e former shareholders of ip metrics totaling  we have no further paymen t obligations 
in october  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of u p to two million shares of our outstanding common stock 
since october  shares have been repurchased at an aggregate purchase price of million 
during   shares were repurchased at an aggregate purchas e price of million 
net cash used in operating activities totaled million for the yea r ended december  compared to million for the year ended december and million for the year ended december  the trend o f decreasing cash used in operations is partially due to our decreasing net loss the decrease in net loss is mainly attributable to our increases in revenues 
i n addition to the decrease in net loss  our non cash charges  includin g depreciation and amortization and equity based compensation increased from million in to million in and million in thes e increases are mainly due to increases in property and equipment 
another facto r contributing to our decrease in cash used in operations is our increase i n deferred revenues of million in compared to million in an d million in the increase in our deferred revenue is the result of a n increase in our maintenance contracts  which are deferred and recognized a s revenue ratably over the term of the contract 
these amounts were partiall y offset by increases in our net accounts receivable balances of million i n  million in and million in the increases in ou r accounts receivable balances are due to our revenue growth 
in  we incurre d a non cash expense of million related to an impairment of long lived an d other assets 
we expect cash used in operating activities to continue t o decrease as we anticipate our net loss will decrease 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in an d million in and net cash used in investing activities was millio n in included in investing activities for each year are the sales an d purchases of our marketable securities 
these represent the sales  maturitie s and reinvesting of our marketable securities

the company s only contractual obligations relate to its operatin g leases 
the company has an operating lease covering its primary office facilit y that expires in february  the company also has several operating lease s related to a domestic office and offices in foreign countries 
the expiratio n dates for these leases ranges from through the following is a schedule of future minimum lease payments for all operating leases as o f december  year ending december thereafter  for the years ended december  and  we paid millio n and million  respectively  related to discontinued operations 
as o f december   all significant obligations related to our discontinue d operations have been settled 
based on our increasing revenues  decreasing net loss and a decrease i n cash used for operations  we believe that our current balance of cash  cas h equivalents and marketable securities  and expected cash flows from operation s will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelv e months

our business model depends upon signing agreements wit h additional oem customers  further developing our reseller sales channel  an d expanding our sales force 
any difficulty in obtaining these oem and reselle r customers or in attracting qualified sales personnel will hinder our ability t o generate additional revenues and achieve or maintain profitability 
failure to achieve anticipated growth could harm our business and operatin g results 
achieving our anticipated growth will depend on a number of factors  som e of which include o retention of key management  marketing and technical personnel  o our ability to increase our customer base and to increase the sales of ou r products  and o competitive conditions in the network storage infrastructure softwar e market 
we cannot assure you that the anticipated growth will be achieved 
th e failure to achieve anticipated growth could harm our business  financia l condition and operating results 
we have significant lease commitments that could impact our profitability 
during the third quarter of  we signed a lease for new office spac e that commenced on november  and continues through february  thi s commitment along with several operating leases related to our foreign office s could impact our ability to achieve or to maintain profitability 
due to the uncertain and shifting development of the network storage softwar e market  we may have difficulty accurately predicting revenue for future period s and appropriately budgeting for expenses 
the rapidly evolving nature of the network storage software market in whic h we sell our products  and other factors that are beyond our control  reduces ou r ability to accurately forecast our quarterly and annual revenue 
however  w e must use our forecasted revenue to establish our expense budget 
most of ou r expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipate d revenue 
as a result  we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timel y manner to offset any shortfall in revenue 
our revenues depend in part on spending by corporate customers 
the operating results of our business depend in part on the overall deman d for network storage software 
because our sales are primarily to major corporat e customers  any softness in demand for network storage software may result i n decreased revenues 
we are dependent on certain key customers 
during the fiscal year ended december   one oem customer accounte d for of our revenues 
while we believe that we will continue to receiv e revenue from this client during the fiscal year ended december   ou r agreement with this customer is terminable upon days notice 
if our contrac t with this oem terminates it would have a material adverse effect on ou r operating results 
the markets for storage area networks and network attached storage are new an d uncertain  and our business will suffer if they do not develop as we expect 
the rapid adoption of storage area networks san and network attache d storage nas solutions is critical to our future success 
the markets for sa n and nas solutions are still unproven  making it difficult to predict their potential sizes or future growth rates 
most potential customers have mad e substantial investments in their current storage networking infrastructure  an d they may elect to remain with current network architectures or to adopt ne w architecture in limited stages or over extended periods of time 
we ar e uncertain whether a viable market for our products will develop or b e sustainable 
if these markets fail to develop  or develop more slowly than w e expect  our business  financial condition and results of operations would b e adversely affected 
the market for ip based storage area networks is new and uncertain  and ou r business will suffer if it does not develop as we expect 
the rapid adoption of ip based storage area networks san is critical t o our future success 
the market for ip based sans is still unproven  making i t difficult to predict the potential size or future growth rate 
most potentia l customers have made substantial investments in their current storage networkin g infrastructure  and they may elect to remain with current network architecture s or to adopt new architecture in limited stages or over extended periods of time we are uncertain whether a viable market for our products will develop or b e sustainable 
if this market fails to develop  or develops more slowly than w e expect  our business  financial condition and results of operations would b e adversely affected

the rapid adoption of disk based backup solutions is critical to our futur e success 
the market for disk based backup solutions is still unproven  making i t difficult to predict the potential size or future growth rate 
most potentia l customers have made substantial investments in their current tape backu p infrastructure  and they may elect to remain with current infrastructure or t o adopt new solutions in limited stages or over extended periods of time 
we ar e uncertain whether a viable market for our products will develop or b e sustainable 
if this market fails to develop  or develops more slowly than w e expect  our business  financial condition and results of operations would b e adversely affected 
we may not be able to penetrate the small medium business  small office and hom e office markets 
we have announced plans to offer products for the small medium busines s smb and small office home office soho markets 
we may not be able to desig n or offer products attractive to the smb and the soho markets  or to reac h agreements with oems and resellers with significant presences in the smb an d soho markets 
if we are unable to penetrate the smb and soho markets  we wil l not be able to recoup the expenses associated with our efforts in these market s and our ability to grow revenues could suffer 
if we are unable to develop and manufacture new products that achieve acceptanc e in the network storage software market  our operating results may suffer 
the network storage software market continues to evolve and as a resul t there is continuing demand for new products 
accordingly  we may need to develo p and manufacture new products that address additional network storage softwar e market segments and emerging technologies to remain competitive in the dat a storage software industry 
we are uncertain whether we will successfully qualif y new network storage software products with our customers by meeting custome r performance and quality specifications or quickly achieve high volume productio n of storage networking software products 
any failure to address additiona l market segments could harm our business  financial condition and operatin g results 
our products must conform to industry standards in order to be accepted b y customers in our markets 
our current products are only one part of a san or nas system 
al l components of these systems must comply with the same industry standards i n order to operate together efficiently 
we depend on companies that provide othe r components of these systems to conform to industry standards 
some industr y standards may not be widely adopted or implemented uniformly  and competin g standards may emerge that may be preferred by oem customers or end users 
if other providers of components do not support the same industry standards as w e do  or if competing standards emerge  our products may not achieve marke t acceptance  which would adversely affect our business 
our complex products may have errors or defects that could result in reduce d demand for our products or costly litigation 
our ipstor platform is complex and is designed to be deployed in large an d complex networks 
many of our customers have unique infrastructures  which ma y require additional professional services in order for our software to wor k within their infrastructure 
because our products are critical to the network s of our customers  any significant interruption in their service as a result o f defects in our product within our customers networks could result in los t profits or damage to our customers 
these problems could cause us to incu r significant service and engineering costs  divert engineering personnel fro m product development efforts and significantly impair our ability to maintai n existing customer relationships and attract new customers 
in addition  a product liability claim  whether successful or not  would likely be tim e consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time an d attention 
further  if we are unable to fix the errors or other problems tha t may be identified in full deployment  we would likely experience loss of o r delay in revenues and loss of market share and our business and prospects woul d suffer 
failure of storage appliances powered by ipstor to integrate smoothly with en d user systems could impact demand for the appliances 
we have entered into agreements with resellers and oem partners to develo p storage appliances that combine certain aspects of ipstor functionality wit h third party hardware to create single purpose turnkey solutions that ar e designed to be easy to deploy 
if the storage appliances are not easy to deplo y or do not integrate smoothly with end user systems  the basic premise behind th e appliances will not be met and sales would suffer 
our oem customers require our products to undergo a lengthy and expensiv e qualification process that does not assure product sales 
prior to offering our products for sale  our oem customers require tha t each of our products undergo an extensive qualification process  which involve s interoperability testing of our product in the oem s system as well as rigorou s reliability testing 
this qualification of a product by an oem does not assur e any sales of the product to the oem 
despite this uncertainty  we devot e substantial resources  including engineering  sales  marketing and managemen t efforts  toward qualifying our products with oems in anticipation of sales t o them 
if we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any products with an oem such failure or delay would preclude or delay sales of that product to the oem which may impede our ability to grow our business 
we rely on our oem customers and resellers for most of our sales 
almost all of our sales come from sales to end users of our products by ou r oem customers and by our resellers 
these oem customers and resellers hav e limited resources and sales forces and sell many different products  both in th e network storage infrastructure software market and in other markets 
the oe m customers and resellers may choose to focus their sales efforts on othe r products in the network storage software market or other markets 
the oe m customers might also choose not to continue to develop or to market product s which include our products 
this would likely result in lower revenues to us an d would impede our ability to grow our business 
issues with the hardware sold by our partners could result in lower sales of ou r products 
as part of our sales channel  we license our software to oems and othe r partners who install our software on their own hardware or on the hardware o f other third parties 
if the hardware does not function properly or causes damag e to customers systems  we could lose sales to future customers  even though ou r software functions properly 
problems with our partners hardware coul d negatively impact our business 
we must maintain our existing relationships and develop new relationships with strategic industry partners 
part of our strategy is to partner with major third party software an d hardware vendors who integrate our products into their offerings and or marke t our products to others 
these strategic partners often have customer o r distribution networks to which we otherwise would not have access or th e development of which would take up large amounts of our time and othe r resources 
there is intense competition to establish relationships with thes e strategic partners 
some of our agreements with our oem customers grant to th e oems limited exclusivity rights to portions of our products for periods of time this could result in lost sales opportunities for us with other customers o r could cause other potential oem partners to consider or select software from ou r competitors for their storage solutions 
in addition  the desire for produc t differentiation could cause potential oem partners to select software from ou r competitors 
we cannot guarantee that our current strategic partners  or thos e companies with whom we may partner in the future  will continue to be ou r partners for any period of time 
if our software were to be replaced in an oe m solution by competing software  or if our software is not selected by oems fo r future solutions  it would likely result in lower revenues to us and woul d impede our ability to grow our business 
the network storage software market is highly competitive and intens e competition could negatively impact our business 
the network storage software market is intensely competitive even durin g periods when demand is stable 
some of our current and potential competitor s have longer operating histories  significantly greater resources  broader nam e recognition and a larger installed base of customers than we have 
thos e competitors and other potential competitors may be able to establish or t o expand network storage software offerings more quickly  adapt to ne w technologies and customer requirements faster  and take advantage of acquisitio n and other opportunities more readily 
our competitors also may o consolidate or establish strategic relationships among themselves to lowe r their product costs or to otherwise compete more effectively against us or o bundle their products with other products to increase demand for thei r products 
in addition  some oems with whom we do business  or hope to do business may enter the market directly and rapidly capture market share 
if we fail t o compete successfully against current or future competitors  our business financial condition and operating results may suffer 
our future quarterly results may fluctuate significantly  which could cause ou r stock price to decline 
while we were profitable in the fourth quarter of  such profitabilit y is not an indicator of future profitability and our future quarterly results ma y fluctuate significantly 
our future performance will depend on many factors  including o the timing of securing software license contracts and the delivery o f software and related revenue recognition  o the seasonality of information technology spending  o the average unit selling price of our products  o existing or new competitors introducing better products at competitiv e prices before we do  o our ability to manage successfully the complex and difficult process o f qualifying our products with our customers  o new products or enhancements from us or our competitors  o import or export restrictions on our proprietary technology  and o personnel changes 
many of our expenses are relatively fixed and difficult to reduce o r modify 
as a result  the fixed nature of our expenses will magnify any advers e effect of a decrease in revenue on our operating results 
our stock price may be volatile the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and ma y be volatile in the future 
for example  during the past twelve months ende d december   the closing market price of our common stock as quoted on th e nasdaq national market system fluctuated between and 
the marke t price of our common stock may be significantly affected by the followin g factors o actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  o failure to meet financial estimates  o changes in market valuations of other technology companies  particularl y those in the storage networking software market  o announcements by us or our competitors of significant technica l innovations  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures o r capital commitments  o loss of one or more key oem customers  and o departures of key personnel 
the stock market has experienced extreme volatility that often has bee n unrelated to the performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuation s may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our performance 
our results of operations will be negatively impacted by the requirement that w e recognize the fair value of stock options granted as an expense 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has required companie s to recognize the fair value of stock options and other stock based compensatio n to employees as compensation expense in the statement of operations  effectiv e july  for falconstor 
while it is too early to tell the exact impact o f this requirement  there will be a negative impact on our results of operations 
we have a significant amount of authorized but unissued preferred stock  whic h may affect the likelihood of a change of control in our company 
our board of directors has the authority  without further action by th e stockholders  to issue up to  shares of preferred stock on such term s and with such rights  preferences and designations  including  withou t limitation restricting dividends on our common stock  dilution of the votin g power of our common stock and impairing the liquidation rights of the holders o f our common stock  as the board may determine without any vote of th e stockholders 
issuance of such preferred stock  depending upon the rights preferences and designations thereof may have the effect of delaying  deterrin g or preventing a change in control 
in addition  certain anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law  among other things  ma y restrict the ability of our stockholders to authorize a merger  busines s combination or change of control 
finally  we have entered into change o f control agreements with certain executives 
we have a significant number of outstanding options and warrants  the exercis e of which would dilute the then existing stockholders percentage ownership o f our common stock 
as of december   we had outstanding options and warrants t o purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a weighte d average exercise price of per share 
we also have  share s reserved for issuance under our stock option plans with respect to options tha t have not been granted 
the exercise of all of the outstanding options would dilute th e then existing stockholders percentage ownership of common stock  and any sale s in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such exercise coul d adversely affect prevailing market prices for the common stock 
moreover  th e terms upon which we would be able to obtain additional equity capital could b e adversely affected because the holders of such securities can be expected t o exercise or convert them at a time when we would  in all likelihood  be able t o obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable than those provided by suc h securities 
our business could be materially affected as a result of a natural disaster terrorist acts  or other catastrophic events in august   our business was interrupted due to a large scal e blackout in the northeastern united states 
while the headquarters facilities w e moved in to in november  contain redundant power supplies and generators our domestic and foreign operations  and the operations of our industr y partners  remain susceptible to fire  floods  power loss  power shortages telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
terrorist actions domestically or abroad could lead to busines s disruptions or to cancellations of customer orders or a general decrease i n corporate spending on information technology  or could have direct impact on ou r marketing  administrative or financial functions and our financial conditio n could suffer 
the international nature of our business could have an adverse affect on ou r operating results 
we sell our products worldwide 
accordingly  our operating results coul d be materially adversely affected by various factors including regulatory political  or economic conditions in a specific country or region  trad e protection measures and other regulatory requirements  and acts of terrorism an d international conflicts 
our international sales are denominated primarily in us dollars 
a n increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies coul d make our products more expensive and  therefore  potentially less competitive i n foreign markets 
additional risks inherent in our international business activitie s generally include  among others  longer accounts receivable payment cycles difficulties in managing international operations  decreased flexibility i n matching workforce to needs as compared with the us  and potentially advers e tax consequences 
such factors could materially adversely affect our futur e international sales and  consequently  our operating results 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  our business will suffer our success is dependent upon our proprietary technology 
currently  th e ipstor software suite is the core of our proprietary technology 
we have on e patent issued  multiple pending patent applications  numerous trademark s registered and multiple pending trademark applications related to our ipsto r product 
we cannot predict whether we will receive patents for our pending o r future patent applications  and any patents that we own or that are issued to u s may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of certai n countries in which we sell and manufacture our products  including variou s countries in asia  may not protect our products and intellectual property right s to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
we also rely on trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  as well as th e confidentiality and other restrictions contained in our respective sale s contracts and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections afford only limited protection 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may cause us to become involve d in costly and lengthy litigation  which could seriously harm our business 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the unite d states involving patents  trademarks and other intellectual property rights 
we have already been subject to one action alleging that our technolog y infringes patents held by a third party 
while we settled this litigation  th e litigation was expensive and diverted management s time and attention 
an y additional litigation  regardless of its outcome  would likely be time consumin g and expensive to resolve and would divert management s time and attention an d might subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidate ou r intellectual property rights 
any potential intellectual property litigatio n against us could force us to take specific actions  including o cease selling our products that use the challenged intellectual property  o obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology or trademark  which licens e may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  or o redesign those products that use infringing intellectual property or ceas e to use an infringing product or trademark 
developments limiting the availability of open source software could impact ou r ability to deliver products and could subject us to costly litigation 
many of our products are designed to include software or othe r intellectual property licensed from third parties  including open source software 
at least one intellectual property rights holder has alleged that i t holds the rights to software traditionally viewed as open source 
it may b e necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects o f these products 
there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would b e available on acceptable terms  if at all 
the inability to obtain certai n licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorabl e terms  or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financia l condition 
moreover  the inclusion in our products of software or othe r intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis coul d limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 
the loss of any of our key personnel could harm our business 
our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key employees many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace 
we do not have key perso n life insurance on any of our personnel 
worldwide competition for skille d employees in the network storage software industry is extremely intense 
if w e are unable to retain existing employees or to hire and integrate new employees our business  financial condition and operating results could suffer 
i n addition  companies whose employees accept positions with competitors ofte n claim that the competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
we may b e the subject of such claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personne l and could incur substantial costs defending ourselves against those claims 
we may not successfully integrate the products  technologies or businesses from or realize the intended benefits of acquisitions 
we have made  and may continue to make  acquisitions of other companies o r their assets 
integration of the acquired products  technologies and businesses could divert management s time and resources 
further  we may not be able t o properly integrate the acquired products  technologies or businesses  with ou r existing products and operations  train  retain and motivate personnel from th e acquired businesses  or combine potentially different corporate cultures 
if w e are unable to fully integrate the acquired products  technologies or businesses or train  retain and motivate personnel from the acquired businesses  we may no t receive the intended benefits of the acquisitions  which could harm ou r business  operating results and financial condition 
if actual results or events differ materially from our estimates an d assumptions  our reported financial condition and results of operations fo r future periods could be materially affected 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements and relate d disclosure in accordance with generally accepted account principles require s management to establish policies that contain estimates and assumptions tha t affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and th e accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements in thi s report on form k describes the significant accounting policies essential t o preparing our financial statements 
the preparation of these financia l statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reporte d amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believ e to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual future results may diffe r materially from these estimates 
we evaluate  on an ongoing basis  our estimate s and assumptions 
long term character of investments 
our present and future equity investments may never appreciate in value and are subject to normal risks associated with equity investments i n businesses 
these investments may involve technology risks as well a s commercialization risks and market risks 
as a result  we may be required t o write down some or all of these investments in the future 
unknown factors additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or whic h currently we deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect us 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risks 
our return on our investments in cash  cash equivalents an d marketable securities is subject to interest rate risks 
we regularly asses s these risks and have established policies and business practices to manage th e market risk of our marketable securities 
foreign currency risk 
we have several offices outside the united states accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreig n currency exchange rates 
the effect of foreign currency exchange rat e fluctuations have not been material since our inception 
we do not us e derivative financial instruments to limit our foreign currency risk exposure
