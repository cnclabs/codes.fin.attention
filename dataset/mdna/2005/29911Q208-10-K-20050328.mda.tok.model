both the local and new york state economies have lagged behind national prosperity  which remains unsettled 
marginal job growth  combined with a declining population base  has left the bank s primary market more susceptible to potential credit problems 
this is particularly true of commercial borrowers 
commercial loans represent a segment of significant past growth  as well as concentration in the company s commercial real estate portfolio 
commercial real estate values may be susceptible to decline in an adverse economy 
management believes that the provision for loan losses complies with the regulations of the occ  and is reflective of its assessment of the local environment  as well as a continued trend in commercial loan activity and balance outstanding

table of contents market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and or interest rates of the bank s financial instruments 
the primary market risk the company is exposed to is interest rate risk 
the core banking activities of lending and deposit taking expose the bank to interest rate risk  which occurs when assets and liabilities re price at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change 
as a result  net interest income earned by the bank is subject to the effects of changing interest rates 
the bank measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
management s philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income 
the balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities  anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities and expected maturities of investment securities  loans and deposits 
management supplements the modeling technique described above with analysis of market values of the company s financial instruments and changes to such market values given changes in the interest rates 
the bank s asset liability committee  which includes members of senior management  monitors the bank s interest rate sensitivity with the aid of a computer model which considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities  as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the re pricing of financial instruments  including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities 
when deemed prudent  management has taken actions  and intends to do so in the future  to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or off balance sheet financial instruments 
possible actions include  but are not limited to  changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products  modifying the composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes 
sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates calculated increase decrease in projected annual net interest income december  december  changes in interest rates in thousands basis points basis points many assumptions were utilized by the bank to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income 
the more significant assumptions related to the rate of prepayments of mortgage related assets  loan and deposit volumes and pricing  and deposit maturities 
the bank also assumed immediate changes in rates  including basis point rate changes 
in the event that a basis point rate change cannot be achieved  the applicable rate changes are limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates cannot be less than zero 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the bank cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results may differ significantly due to the timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials spreads between maturity re pricing categories  as well as any actions  such as those previously described  which management may take to counter such changes 
in light of the uncertainties and assumptions associated with the process  the amounts presented in the table above and changes in such amounts are not considered significant to the bank s projected net interest income

there is a risk that the bank could be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at such properties after acquisition by the bank  and may be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage  personal injury and investigation and clean up costs incurred by such parties in connection with such contamination 
in addition  the owner or former owners of contaminated sites may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from such property 
to date  the bank has not been required to perform any investigation or clean up activities  nor has it been subject to any environmental claims 
there can be no assurance  however  that this will remain the case in the future 
competition all phases of the company s business are highly competitive 
the company competes actively with local  regional and national financial institutions  as well as with bank branches or insurance agency offices in the company s market area of erie county  niagara county  northern chautauqua county  and northwestern cattaraugus county  new york 
these western new york counties have a high density of financial institutions  many of which are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than the company 
the company faces competition for loans and deposits from other commercial banks  savings banks  savings and loan associations  mortgage banking companies  credit unions  insurance companies and other financial services companies 
the company faces additional competition for deposits and insurance business from non depository competitors such as the mutual fund industry  securities and brokerage firms  and insurance companies and brokerages 
the company attempts to be generally competitive with all financial institutions in its service area with respect to interest rates paid on time and savings deposits  service charges on deposit accounts  and interest rates charged on loans

the frb also considers managerial  capital and other financial factors in acting on acquisition or merger applications 
a bank holding company may not engage in  or acquire direct or indirect control of more than of the voting shares of any company engaged in any non banking activity  unless such activity has been determined by the frb to be closely related to banking or managing banks

various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the bank  including state usury laws  laws relating to fiduciaries  consumer credit and equal credit  fair credit reporting  and privacy of non public financial information 
the bank is subject to sections a and b of the federal reserve act and regulation w thereunder  which govern certain transactions  such as loans  extensions of credit  investments and purchases of assets between member banks and their affiliates  including their parent holding companies 
these restrictions limit the transfer of funds to the company in the form of loans  extensions of credit  investments or purchases of assets collectively  transfers  and they require that the bank s transactions with the company be on terms no less favorable to the bank than comparable transactions between the bank and unrelated third parties 
transfers by the bank to the company are limited in amount to of the bank s capital and surplus  and transfers to all affiliates are limited in the aggregate to of the bank s capital and surplus 
furthermore  such loans and extensions of credit are also subject to various collateral requirements 
these regulations and restrictions may limit the company s ability to obtain funds from the bank for its cash needs  including funds for acquisitions  and the payment of dividends  interest and operating expenses 
the bank is prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit  lease or sale of property or furnishing of services 
for example  the bank may not generally require a customer to obtain other services from the bank or the company  and may not require the customer to promise not to obtain other services from a competitor as a condition to an extension of credit 
the bank is also subject to certain restrictions imposed by the federal reserve act on extensions of credit to executive officers  directors  principal stockholders or any related interest of such persons 
extensions of credit i must be made on substantially the same terms including interest rates and collateral as  and following credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not covered above and who are not employees  and ii must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features

the deposits of the bank are insured by the fdic through the insurance fund to the extent provided by law 
under the fdic s risk based insurance system  institutions insured through the insurance fund are currently assessed premiums based on eligible deposits  and depending upon the institutions capital position and other supervisory factors 
legislation also provides for assessments against institutions insured through the insurance fund which will be used to pay certain financing corporation fico obligations 
in addition to any insurance fund assessments  banks insured through the insurance fund are expected to make payments for the fico obligations based on eligible deposits each year 
the assessment is determined quarterly 
regulations promulgated by the fdic pursuant to the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of place limitations on the ability of certain insured depository institutions to accept  renew or rollover deposits by offering rates of interest which are significantly higher than the prevailing rates of interest on deposits offered by other depository institutions having the same type of charter in such depository institutions normal market area 
under these regulations  well capitalized institutions may accept  renew or rollover such deposits without restriction  while adequately capitalized institutions may accept  renew or rollover such deposits with a waiver from the fdic subject to certain restrictions on payment of rates 
undercapitalized institutions may not accept  renew or rollover such deposits 
under the financial institutions reform  recovery and enforcement act of  a depository institution insured by the fdic can be held liable for any loss incurred by  or reasonably expected to be incurred by  the fdic in connection with i the default of a commonly controlled fdic insured depository institution  or ii any assistance provided by the fdic to a commonly controlled fdic insured institution in danger of default 
default is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or receiver  and in danger of default is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 
the federal regulators have adopted regulations and examination procedures promoting the safety and soundness of individual institutions by specifically addressing  among other things i internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  ii loan documentation  iii credit underwriting  iv interest rate exposure  v asset growth  vi ratio of classified assets to capital  vii minimum earnings  and viii compensation and benefits standards for management officials 
the frb  the occ and other federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers  including the power to terminate deposit insurance  and impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver for the assets of a regulated entity 
failure to comply with applicable laws  regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the company or its banking subsidiary  as well as officers  directors and other institution affiliated parties of these organizations  to administrative sanctions and potential civil monetary penalties 
capital adequacy the frb  the fdic and the occ have adopted risk based capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies and banks under their supervision 
under these guidelines  the so called tier capital and total capital as a percentage of risk weighted assets and certain off balance sheet instruments must be at least and  respectively 
the frb  the fdic and the occ have also imposed a leverage standard to supplement their risk based ratios 
this leverage standard focuses on a banking institution s ratio of tier capital to average total assets  adjusted for goodwill and certain other items 
under these guidelines  banking institutions that meet certain criteria  including excellent asset quality  high liquidity  low interest rate exposure and good earnings  and that have received the highest regulatory rating must maintain a ratio of tier capital to total adjusted average assets of at least 
institutions not meeting these criteria  as well as institutions with supervisory  financial or operational weaknesses  along with those experiencing or anticipating significant growth  are expected to maintain a tier capital to total adjusted average assets ratio equal to at least 
as reflected in the following table  the risk based capital ratios and leverage ratios of the company and the bank as of december  and exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as well capitalized  the highest classification under the regulatory capital guidelines

bank regulators periodically propose amendments to the risk based capital guidelines and related regulatory framework  and consider changes to the risk based capital standards that could significantly increase the amount of capital needed to meet the requirements for the capital tiers described below 
while the company s management studies such proposals  the timing of adoption  ultimate form and effect of any such proposed amendments on the company s capital requirements and operations cannot be predicted 
the federal banking agencies are required to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions and their bank holding companies that do not meet minimum capital requirements  fdicia established five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
a depository institution s capital tier  or that of its bank holding company  depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures  including a risk based capital measure and a leverage ratio capital measure  and certain other factors 
under the implementing regulations adopted by the federal banking agencies  a bank holding company or bank is considered well capitalized if it has i a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  ii a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and iii a leverage ratio of or greater  and is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for an capital measure 
an adequately capitalized bank holding company or bank is defined as one that has i a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  ii a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and iii a leverage ratio of or greater or or greater in the case of a bank with a composite camels rating of 
a bank holding company or bank is considered a undercapitalized if it has i a total risk based capital ratio of less than  ii a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or iii a leverage ratio of less than or in the case of a bank with a composite camels rating of  b significantly undercapitalized if the bank has i a total risk based capital ratio of less than  or ii a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or iii a leverage ratio of less than  and c critically undercapitalized if the bank has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets equal to or less than 
the frb may reclassify a well capitalized bank holding company or bank as adequately capitalized or subject an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to the supervisory actions applicable to the next lower capital category if it determines that the bank holding company or bank is in an unsafe or unsound condition or deems the bank holding company or bank to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice and not to have corrected the deficiency 
the company and the bank currently meet the definition of well capitalized institutions 
undercapitalized depository institutions  among other things  are subject to growth limitations  are prohibited  with certain exceptions  from making capital distributions  are limited in their ability to obtain funding from a federal reserve bank  and are required to submit a capital restoration plan 
the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining  among other things  that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution s capital 
in addition  for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable  the depository institution s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan and provide appropriate assurances of performance 
if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan  including if the holding company refuses or is unable to make the guarantee described in the previous sentence  it is treated as if it is 
table of contents significantly undercapitalized 
failure to submit or implement an acceptable capital plan also is grounds for the appointment of a conservator or a receiver 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of additional requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
moreover  the parent holding company of a significantly undercapitalized depository institution may be ordered to divest itself of the institution or of non bank subsidiaries of the holding company 
critically undercapitalized institutions  among other things  are prohibited from making any payments of principal and interest on subordinated debt  and are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator 
each federal banking agency prescribes standards for depository institutions and depository institution holding companies relating to internal controls  information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  compensation  a maximum ratio of classified assets to capital  minimum earnings sufficient to absorb losses  a minimum ratio of market value to book value for publicly traded shares and other standards as they deem appropriate 
the frb and the occ have adopted such standards 
financial services modernization and other recent legislation the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the riegle neal act facilitates the interstate expansion and consolidation of banking organizations by permitting bank holding companies that are adequately capitalized and managed to acquire banks located in states outside their home states  regardless of whether such acquisitions are authorized under the law of the host state 
the riegle neal act also permits interstate mergers of banks  with some limitations  and the establishment of new branches on an interstate basis  provided that such actions are authorized by the law of the host state 
the gramm leach bliley act of the glb act permits banks  securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate under a common holding company structure 
in addition to allowing new forms of financial services combinations  the glb act clarifies how financial services conglomerates will be regulated by the different federal and state regulators 
the glb act amended by the bhca and expanded the permissible activities of certain qualifying bank holding companies  known as financial holding companies 
in addition to engaging in banking and activities closely related to banking  as determined by the frb by regulation or order  financial holding companies may engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to financial activities that are complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 
under the glb act  all financial institutions  including the company and the bank  are required to develop privacy policies  restrict the sharing of non public customer data with non affiliated parties at the customer s request  and establish procedures and practices to protect customer data from unauthorized access

sarbanes oxley act on july   the sarbanes oxley act of the soa was signed into law 
the stated goals of the soa are to increase corporate responsibility  to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws 
the soa includes very specific additional disclosure requirements and new corporate governance rules  requires the sec  the national securities exchanges and the national securities associations to adopt and implement disclosure and corporate governance standards  and mandates further studies or certain issues by the sec and the comptroller general 
the soa represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems  such as the regulation of the accounting profession  and to state corporate law  such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees 

table of contents the soa addresses  among other matters audit committees  required reporting on internal controls over financial reporting by management and auditors  certification of financial statements by a reporting company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer  or their equivalent  the forfeiture of bonuses or other incentive based compensation and profits from the sale of an issuer s securities by directors and senior officers in the month period following initial publication of any financial statements that later require restatement  a prohibition on insider trading during pension plan blackout periods  disclosure of off balance sheet transactions  a prohibition on certain loans to directors and officers  expedited filing requirements for forms  the adoption of a code of ethics for the issuer s principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officers  and disclosure of any change or waiver of such code  real time filing of periodic reports  the formation of a public company accounting oversight board  auditor independence  and various increased civil and criminal penalties for violations of securities laws 
some provisions of the soa went into effect immediately july   while others required the sec to adopt implementing rules within specified periods 
nearly all of the implementing rules have been finalized by the sec 
monetary policy and economic control the commercial banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the monetary policies of the frb 
changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowing  availability of borrowing at the discount window  open market operations  the imposition of changes in reserve requirements against member banks deposits and assets of foreign branches and the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates are some of the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb 
these monetary policies are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distributions of bank loans  investments and deposits  and this use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits 
the monetary policies of the frb have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the monetary policies of these agencies are influenced by various factors  including inflation  unemployment  and short term and long term changes in the international trade balance and in the fiscal policies of the united states government 
future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on the future business and earnings of the company cannot be predicted
