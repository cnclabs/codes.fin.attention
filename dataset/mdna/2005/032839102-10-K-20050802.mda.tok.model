item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations set forth below is a discussion and analysis of the corporation s financial condition and results of operations including information on the corporation s asset liability management strategies  sources of liquidity and capital resources  as well as significant accounting policies 
management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and supplemental data contained elsewhere in this report 
significant accounting policies there are a number of accounting policies that require the use of judgment 
some of the more significant policies are as follows establishing the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires the use of judgment as well as other systematic objective and quantitative methods 
assets are evaluated at least quarterly and risk components reviewed as a part of that evaluation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies allowances for loan losses in item for a discussion of risk components 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights requires the use of judgment 
mortgage servicing rights are established on loans that are originated and subsequently sold 
a portion of the loan s book basis is allocated to mortgage servicing rights when a loan is sold 
the fair value of mortgage servicing rights is the present value of estimated future net cash flows from the servicing relationship using current market assumptions for prepayments  servicing costs and other factors 
as the loans are repaid and net servicing revenue is earned  mortgage servicing rights are amortized into expense 
net servicing revenues are expected to exceed this amortization expense 
however  if actual prepayment experience exceeds what was originally anticipated  net servicing revenues may be less than expected and mortgage servicing rights may be impaired 
mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of cost or market value 
goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment  which requires judgment 
goodwill has been recorded as a result of an acquisition in which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of net assets acquired 
the price paid for the acquisition is analyzed and compared to a number of current indices 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired  it would be expensed in the period in which it became impaired 
restatement in june  the corporation determined to restate its consolidated financial statements for the years ended march  to march  and each of the quarters of the year ended march  and the first three quarters of the year ended march  the determination was made to restate these financial statements in connection with the corporation s accounting for loans originated by the corporation through the mortgage partnership finance mpf program of the federal home loan bank of chicago fhlb 
historically  the corporation has been an active participant in the mpf program developed by the fhlb of chicago and implemented by eight other fhlbs 
the program is intended to provide member institutions with an alternative to holding fixed rate mortgages in their loan portfolios or selling them in the secondary market 
an institution participates in the mpf program by either originating individual loans on a flow basis as an agent for the fhlb pursuant to the mpf program or by selling  as principal  closed loans owned by an institution to the fhlb pursuant to one of the fhlb s closed loan programs 
under the mpf program  credit 
table of contents risk is shared by the participating institution and the fhlb by structuring the loss exposure in several layers  with the participating institution being liable for losses after application of an initial layer of losses after any private mortgage insurance is absorbed by the fhlb  subject to an agreed upon maximum amount of such secondary credit enhancement which is intended to be in an amount equivalent to a aa credit risk rating by a rating agency 
the participating institution receives credit enhancement fees from the fhlb for providing this secondary credit enhancement and continuing to manage the credit risk of the mpf program loans 
participating institutions are also paid specified servicing fees for servicing the loans 
transfers involving sales with the corporation acting as principal are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities sfas with the recognition of gains or losses on sale and related mortgage servicing rights see mortgage servicing rights in note to the consolidated financial statements 
originations under the mpf program are not accounted for as loan sales  nor are mortgage servicing rights recognized 
rather  servicing fees are reported in income on a monthly basis as servicing activities are performed 
the corporation has participated in the mpf program by originating loans on an agency basis through the mpf program  but has determined that it incorrectly accounted for these transactions as sales of loans under sfas the correction of this accounting required the corporation to reverse gains on agency loan sales related to the mpf program and to remove from its consolidated balance sheet related mortgage servicing rights previously included in accrued interest on investments and loans and other assets 
the corporation s operating results were also adjusted to remove from loan servicing income the amortization expense and impairment charges associated with the de recognized mortgage servicing rights and to reflect the tax consequences of the adjusted pre tax income 
finally  the corporation has reported as a separate line item in its consolidated statements of income credit enhancement derivative income 
previously  this income was included in loan servicing income 
the effect of these accounting changes is to reduce net income by    and  for the years ended march    and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item for a summary of the effects of these changes on the corporation s consolidated balance sheet as of march   and on its consolidated statements of income for the years ending march  and the accompanying management s discussion and analysis gives effect to these corrections 

table of contents segment review the corporation s primary reportable segment is community banking 
community banking consists of lending and deposit gathering as well as other banking related products and services to businesses  governments  and consumers and the support to deliver  fund  and manage such banking services 
the corporation s real estate segment invests in real estate developments 
the corporation s profitability is predominantly dependent on net interest income  non interest income  the level of the provision for loan losses  non interest expense  and taxes of its community banking segment 
the results of operations of the corporation s segments are set forth in the following tables year ended march  consolidated real estate community intersegment financial investments banking eliminations statements in thousands interest income interest expense net interest income loss provision for loan losses net interest income loss after provision for loan losses real estate investment partnership revenue other revenue from real estate operations other income real estate investment partnership cost of sales other expense from real estate partnership operations minority interest in income of real estate partnerships other expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income total assets

net income increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary component of this increase in earnings for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was a million increase in non interest income  primarily due to a million increase in income from the corporation s real estate segment 
in addition  there was an increase of million in net interest income after the provision for loan losses 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in non interest expense of million  due primarily to a million increase attributable to the corporation s real estate segment and an increase in tax expense of  the returns on average assets and average stockholders equity for fiscal were and  respectively  as compared to and  respectively  for fiscal net interest income 
net interest income increased by million during fiscal due to a larger increase in the volume of interest earning assets compared to the increase in the volume of interest bearing liabilities coupled with a greater decrease in the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities as compared to the decrease in the yields earned on interest earning assets 
the average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities increased to billion and billion in fiscal  respectively  from billion and billion  respectively  in fiscal the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities remained steady at in both fiscal and the average yield on interest earning assets in fiscal versus in fiscal decreased  as did the average cost on interest bearing liabilities in fiscal versus in fiscal 
the net interest margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal and the interest rate spread increased to from in fiscal 
table of contents and  respectively 
the increase in the net interest margin is reflective of a decrease in the cost of funds  slightly offset by a smaller decrease in yields on loans as interest rates continue to decrease 
these factors are reflected in the analysis of changes in net interest income  arising from changes in the volume of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and the rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities as set forth below 
the analysis indicates that the increase of million in net interest income stemmed from net rate volume increases in interest earning assets of million as well as the net rate volume decreases of interest bearing liabilities of  provision for loan losses 
provision for loan losses decreased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal based on management s ongoing evaluation of asset quality 
although there was an increase in net charge offs of  in fiscal  primarily due to increased mortgage and consumer loan charge offs  there was a decrease in non accrual loans  particularly in commercial real estate loans 
the corporation s allowance for loan losses decreased million from million at march  to million at march  this amount represented of total loans at march   as compared to of total loans at march  for further discussion of the allowance for loan losses  see financial condition allowance for loan and foreclosure losses 
future provisions for loan losses will continue to be based upon management s assessment of the overall loan portfolio and the underlying collateral  trends in non performing loans  current economic conditions and other relevant factors in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels to provide for probable and estimable future losses 
the establishment of the amount of the loan loss allowance inherently involves judgments by management as to the adequacy of the allowance  which ultimately may or may not be correct 
higher rates of loan defaults than anticipated would likely result in a need to increase provisions in future years 
also  as multi family and commercial loan portfolios increase  additional provisions would likely be added to the loan loss allowance as they carry a higher risk of loss 
non interest income 
non interest income increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal primarily due to the increase of income from the corporation s real estate segment of million for fiscal in addition  loan servicing income increased million primarily due to the decrease in the amortization of mortgage servicing rights  and service charges on deposits increased  essentially due to a growth in deposits 
partially offsetting these increases were decreases in other categories 
net gain on sale of loans decreased million largely due to the increasing interest rate environment  which resulted in significantly lower levels of refinancing activity 
loan refinance activity and the ability to recognize gains from the sale of fixed rate loans is significantly dependent on decreasing interest rates and  as a result  there can be no assurance that the level of loan refinance activity and gains from the sale of loans recorded in prior periods can be sustained in future periods 
net gain on sale of investments and mortgage related securities decreased million 
such gains also are subject to significant inter period variations due to changes in market and economic conditions 
other non interest income  which includes a variety of loan fee and other miscellaneous fee income  decreased million 
insurance commissions decreased  non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal primarily due to the increase of real estate investment partnership cost of sales of million 
in addition  compensation increased million largely due to an increase in insurance and other benefits  other expenses increased million mainly due to an increase in contributions as well as legal and consulting fees  and marketing expense increased million due to an increase in media expense 
furniture and equipment also increased  occupancy increased  and data processing increased  these increases were offset by a decrease in other expenses from real estate partnership operations of  expense associated with the regulatory actions referred to under regulatory actions below and in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item amounted to approximately million in fiscal ongoing expense associated with compliance activities associated with these actions is estimated to amount to approximately  to  per year 
real estate segment 
net income generated by the real estate segment increased million for fiscal to million from million in fiscal the primary reason for the increase for fiscal was an 
table of contents increase of million in partnership sales offset by a million increase in real estate investment cost of sales  a million increase in minority interest in income of real estate partnerships and a million increase in income tax expense 
partnership sales and cost of sales increased significantly as the result of the sale of lots to a third party which resulted in approximately million of net income after tax 
future sales revenues are based on the interest rate environment 
therefore  management cannot predict future activity 
minority interests 
minority interest in income of real estate partnership operations represents the share of income of development partners in the corporation s real estate investment partnerships 
such minority interest increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the increase of partnership sales and cost of sales

income tax expense increased  for fiscal as compared to fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was as compared to for fiscal in fiscal  the corporation reached an agreement with the wisconsin department of revenue to pay wisconsin tax on the income of aic  its nevada investment subsidiary 
in fiscal  aic recorded million in state tax expense which was partially offset by a reduction in federal tax expense of  in addition  a state tax payment of  was made in fiscal  which will be partially offset by an additional federal tax benefit of  for fiscal the corporation was able to recover million of previously booked federal and state tax provisions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item comparison of years ended march  and general 
net income decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary component of this decrease in earnings for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was a decrease of million in net interest income after the provision for loan losses 
in addition  non interest expense increased million  primarily due to million of expense associated with the corporation s real estate segment 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in non interest income of million  of which million was attributable to the corporation s real estate segment  and a decrease in tax expense of  the returns on average assets and average stockholders equity for fiscal were and  respectively  as compared to and  respectively  for fiscal net interest income 
net interest income decreased by million during fiscal due to a smaller increase in the volume of interest earning assets compared to the increase in the volume of interest bearing liabilities coupled with a greater decrease in the yields earned on interest earning assets as compared to the decrease in the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities increased to billion and billion in fiscal  respectively  from billion and billion  respectively  in fiscal the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the average yield on interest earning assets in fiscal versus in fiscal decreased  as did the average cost of interest bearing liabilities in fiscal versus in fiscal 
the net interest margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal and the interest rate spread decreased to from in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in the net interest margin is reflective of a decrease in the cost of funds which was offset by a larger decrease in yields on loans as interest rates continue to decrease 
these factors are reflected in the analysis of changes in net interest income  arising from changes in the volume of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and the rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities 
the analysis indicates that the decrease of million in net interest income stemmed from net rate volume decreases in interest earning assets of million which were greater than net rate volume decreases of interest bearing liabilities of million 
provision for loan losses 
provision for loan losses increased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal based on management s ongoing evaluation of asset quality 
although there was a decrease in net charge offs of  in fiscal  primarily due to increased mortgage and commercial 
table of contents business loan recoveries and decreased mortgage loan charge offs  there was an increase in non accrual loans  particularly in commercial real estate loans 
the corporation s allowance for loan losses decreased million from million at march  to million at march  this amount represented 
of total loans at march   as compared to of total loans at march  for further discussion of the allowance for loan losses  see financial condition allowance for loan and foreclosure losses 
non interest income 
non interest income increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal primarily due to the addition of million of revenue attributable to the corporation s real estate segment for fiscal as a result of the implementation of fin during the period 
non interest income also increased in fiscal primarily as a result of the increase of loan servicing income of million and the increase of net gain on sale of investments and mortgage related securities of million 
the gain on sale of securities was largely due to the sale of a group of mortgage backed securities that were sold to reach their maximum profit potential in relation to the changing interest rate environment 
the increase in loan servicing income was primarily due to an increase in credit enhancement fee income from the fhlb mortgage partnership finance program and a decrease in the amortization of mortgage servicing rights due to a decrease in loan sales in fiscal service charges on deposits increased  essentially due to a growth in deposits  and insurance commissions increased  due to increased sales of policies in fiscal partially offsetting these increases were decreases in other categories 
net gain on sale of loans decreased million  largely due to the increasing interest rate environment  which resulted in significantly lower levels of refinancing activity 
loan refinance activity and the ability to recognize gains from the sale of fixed rate loans is significantly dependent on decreasing interest rates and  as a result  there can be no assurance that the level of loan refinance activity and gains from the sale of loans recorded in prior periods can be sustained in future periods 
other non interest income  which includes a variety of loan fee and other miscellaneous fee income  decreased  non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal primarily due to the addition of real estate investment partnership cost of sales of million  other expenses from real estate partnership operations of million and minority interest in income of real estate partnership operations of million for fiscal as a result of the implementation of fin during the period 
the million increase in compensation expense was largely due to an increase in incentive compensation resulting from increased loan production earlier in the fiscal year 
occupancy expense increased  due to increased maintenance and repairs  increased leasehold rental and increased depreciation 
in addition  furniture and equipment expense increased  in fiscal  primarily due to normal replacement costs and increased depreciation expense 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of  in data processing expense and a decrease of  in other non interest expense in fiscal real estate segment 
net income generated by the real estate segment increased million for fiscal to million from  in fiscal the primary reason for the increase was the fact that fin was adopted in december minority interests 
minority interest in income of real estate partnership operations represents the share of income of development partners in the corporation s real estate investment partnerships 
such minority interest amounted to million in fiscal and reflected the corporation s adoption of fin for more information on the effects of the implementation of fin on the consolidated operation of the corporation  see real estate held for development and sale and variable interest entities  in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item income taxes

financial condition general 
total assets of the corporation increased million  or  from billion at march  to billion at march  this increase was primarily funded by a net increase in deposits of million 
these funds were generally invested in loans receivable  which increased by million during fiscal mortgage related securities 
mortgage related securities both available for sale and held to maturity decreased million as a net result during the year of i purchases of million  ii principal repayments and market value adjustments of million and iii sales of million 
mortgage related securities consisted of million of mortgage backed securities million were available for sale and 
table of contents million were held to maturity and million of mortgage derivative securities million were available for sale and  were held to maturity at march  the decrease in mortgage related securities was largely due to the sale of a group of mortgage backed securities that were sold to reach their maximum profit potential in relation to the changing interest rate environment 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in item mortgage related securities are subject to inherent risks based upon the future performance of the underlying collateral ie  mortgage loans for these securities 
among these risks are prepayment risk and interest rate risk 
should general interest rate levels decline  the mortgage related securities portfolio would be subject to i prepayments as borrowers typically would seek to obtain financing at lower rates  ii a decline in interest income received on adjustable rate mortgage related securities  and iii an increase in fair value of fixed rate mortgage related securities 
conversely  should general interest rate levels increase  the mortgage related securities portfolio would be subject to i a longer term to maturity as borrowers would be less likely to prepay their loans  ii an increase in interest income received on adjustable rate mortgage related securities  iii a decline in fair value of fixed rate mortgage related securities  and iv a decline in fair value of adjustable rate mortgage related securities to an extent dependent upon the level of interest rate increases  the time period to the next interest rate repricing date for the individual security and the applicable periodic annual and or lifetime cap which could limit the degree to which the individual security could reprice within a given time period 
loans receivable 
total net loans increased million during fiscal from billion at march  to billion at march  the activity included i originations of billion  ii sales of million  and iii principal repayments and other reductions of billion 
during  the corporation originated billion of loans for investment  as compared to billion and billion during the fiscal and  respectively 
of the billion of loans originated for investment in fiscal  million or was comprised of single family residential loans  million or was comprised of multi family residential and commercial real estate loans  million or was comprised of construction and land loans  million or was comprised of consumer loans and million or was comprised of commercial business loans 
single family residential loans held by the corporation for investment amounted to million and million at march  and  respectively  which represented approximately of gross loans held for investment in each case 
in the aggregate  gross multi family residential and commercial real estate loans  construction and land loans  consumer loans and commercial business loans  each of which involves more risk than single family residential loans because of the nature of  or in certain cases the absence of  loan collateral  increased million or from march  to march  but continued to represent approximately of gross loans held for investment at both dates 
single family residential loans originated for sale amounted to million in fiscal  as compared to billion and billion in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the increasing interest rate environment in fiscal at march   loans held for sale  which consisted of single family residential loans  multi family residential loans and commercial real estate loans  amounted to million  as compared to million at march  non performing assets 
non performing assets consisting of non accrual loans  non performing real estate held for development and sale  foreclosed properties and repossessed assets decreased to million or of total assets at march  from million  or  of total assets at march  
table of contents non performing assets are summarized as follows for the dates indicated at march  dollars in thousands non accrual loans single family residential multi family residential commercial real estate construction and land consumer commercial business total non accrual loans real estate held for development and sale foreclosed properties and repossessed assets  net total non performing assets performing troubled debt restructurings total non accrual loans to total loans total non performing assets to total assets allowance for loan losses to total loans allowance for loan losses to total non accrual loans allowance for loan and foreclosure losses to total non performing assets non accrual loans decreased  in fiscal to million at march  this decrease was largely attributable to a million decrease in non accrual commercial real estate loans as well as decreases in non accrual single family residential and consumer loans 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in non accrual commercial business loans 
the decrease in non accrual commercial real estate loans was largely attributable to the removal of four loans 
one was a million loan secured by a unit hotel in kenosha  wisconsin which was paid off 
the second was a million loan secured by retail property located in dallas  texas which was paid off 
the third was a million loan secured by a unit student housing apartment building located in minneapolis  minnesota which was paid off 
the fourth  a unit motel located in schiller park  illinois  with a carrying value of million at march   was transferred to foreclosed properties and repossessed assets at a net carrying value of million 
these decreases were partially offset by the addition of a commercial development property located in madison  wisconsin with a carrying value of million at march  the increase in non accrual commercial business loans was attributable to one loan 
the loan  which had a carrying value of million at march   was to a computer software and consulting company located in tempe  arizona 
loans are placed on non accrual status when  in the judgment of management  the probability of collection of interest is deemed to be insufficient to warrant further accrual 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income 
as a matter of policy  the corporation does not accrue interest on loans past due more than days 
foreclosed properties and repossessed assets decreased  in fiscal this decrease was attributable to the sale of several properties with a carrying value of approximately million which were partially offset by the foreclosure of properties with a carrying value of million 
performing troubled debt restructurings at march  were million less than the amount at march  at march   there were no troubled debt restructurings 

table of contents at march   the bank s classified assets for regulatory purposes amounted to million  or million less than the amount of classified assets at march  this decrease is in keeping with local and national economic conditions 
allowances for loan and foreclosure losses 
the corporation s loan portfolio  foreclosed properties  and repossessed assets are evaluated on a continuous basis to determine the necessity for additions to the allowances for losses and the related balance in the allowances 
these evaluations consider several factors  including  but not limited to  general economic conditions  collateral value  loan portfolio composition  loan delinquencies  prior loss experience  anticipated loss of interest and losses inherent in the portfolio 
the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses includes a review of known loan problems as well as potential loan problems based upon historical trends and ratios 
to determine the level and composition of the loan loss allowance  the loan portfolio is broken out by categories of single family residential  multi family residential  commercial real estate  construction and land  consumer and commercial business 
these categories are then further divided into performing and non performing 
within the non performing category  loans are classified as substandard  doubtful or loss 
a five year historical trend is developed for each category of loan outlined above to arrive at the historical loss level of each category 
this historical ratio of loss reserves and other ratios are applied to the respective performing and non performing categories of loans to arrive at the appropriate level of loss reserve for each loan category 
for commercial business loans  a four year historical trend is applied since that category has shown significant growth both in terms of overall balance and loss history associated with that growth 
the corporation has allocated all of its allowance for loan losses to specific categories as a result of its analysis of the loan portfolio 
also  within specific loan categories  certain loans may be identified for specific reserve allocations 
foreclosed properties are recorded at the lower of carrying or fair value with charge offs  if any  charged to the allowance for loan losses prior to transfer to foreclosed property 
the fair value is primarily based on appraisals  discounted cash flow analysis the majority of which are based on current occupancy and lease rates and pending offers 
a summary of the activity in the allowance for loan losses follows year ended march  dollars in thousands allowance at beginning of year purchase of ledger capital corp 
charge offs mortgage consumer commercial business total charge offs recoveries mortgage consumer commercial business total recoveries net charge offs provision allowance at end of year net charge offs to average loans held for sale and for investment 
table of contents loan charge offs were million and million for the fiscal years ending march  and  respectively 
total charge offs for the years ended march  and increased  and  respectively  from the prior fiscal years 
the increase in charge offs for fiscal was largely due to an increase of million in mortgage loan charge offs as well as a  increase in consumer loan charge offs  offset in part by a million decrease in commercial business charge offs 
the increase in charge offs for fiscal was largely due to an increase of  in commercial business charge offs and an increase in consumer charge offs of  offset in part by a decrease in mortgage charge offs of  recoveries slightly offset the charge offs for the year ended march  and such recoveries increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal recoveries increased  during the fiscal year ended march  management believes that the increased level in net charge offs of  for the year ended march  and the decreased level in net charge offs of  for the year ended march  do not represent changes in the quality of the loan portfolio  but instead generally reflect the local and national trends in overall consumer debt levels and bankruptcy filings

management also continues to pursue all practical and legal methods of collection  repossession and disposal  and adheres to high underwriting standards in the origination process in order to continue to maintain strong asset quality 
deposits 
deposits increased million during fiscal to billion  of which million was due to increases in certificates of deposit  million was due to increases in money market accounts  million was due to increases in interest bearing checking accounts and million was due to increases in passbook accounts 
the increases were due to promotions and related growth of deposit households as interest rates begin to edge upward in the latter part of fiscal deposits obtained from brokerage firms which solicit deposits from their customers for deposit with the corporation amounted to million at march   as compared to million at march  the weighted average cost of deposits decreased to at fiscal year end compared to at fiscal year end borrowings 
fhlb advances decreased million during fiscal because favorable interest rates encouraged an increase in deposits needed to fund mortgage refinances 
at march   advances totaled million and had a weighted average interest rate of compared to advances of million with a weighted average interest rate of at march  other loans payable decreased million from the prior fiscal year 
other loans payable consist of borrowings of the corporation of million  which was primarily for the purpose of the corporation s stock repurchase program  an increase of million over march  this increase was offset by a decrease of million of borrowings by the partnerships of idi s subsidiaries  to million 
per fin  such borrowings are consolidated into the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item stockholders equity 
stockholders equity at march  was million  or of total assets  compared to million  or of total assets at march  stockholders equity increased during the year as a result of i comprehensive income of million  which includes net income of million and a decrease in net unrealized losses on available for sale securities included as a part of accumulated other comprehensive income of million  ii the exercise of stock options of million  iii the purchase of stock by retirement plans of million  and iv the tax benefit from certain stock options of  these increases were partially offset by i the repurchase of common stock of million and ii the payment of cash dividends of million 
liquidity and capital resources on a parent only basis at march   the corporation s commitments and debt service requirements consisted primarily of million of loans payable to us bank pursuant to a million line of credit and million of mortgage loans secured by real estate held for development 
the rate on the line of credit was at march  and the line of credit matures in october currently  the corporation uses available funds primarily to fund common stock repurchase programs and loans to idi and other non bank subsidiaries  which amounted to million at march  the corporation s principal sources of funds for it to meet its parent only obligations are dividends from the bank  which are subject to regulatory limitations  and borrowings from public and private sources 
during fiscal  the bank made dividend payments of million to the corporation  and at march  the bank had million available for dividends that could be paid to the corporation without application for approval by but with prior notice to the ots 
for the bank  liquidity represents the ability to fund asset growth  accommodate deposit withdrawals  pay operating expenses and meet other contractual obligations and commitments 
see contractual obligations and commitments below 
the bank s primary sources of funds are principal and interest payments on loans receivable and mortgage related securities  sales of mortgage loans originated for sale  fhlb advances  deposits and other borrowings 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and mortgage related securities are a predictable source of 
table of contents funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank has entered into agreements with certain brokers that will provide blocks of funds at specified interest rates for an identified fee  or so called brokered deposits 
at march   the bank had million of brokered deposits 
in fiscal  consolidated operating activities resulted in a net cash inflow of million 
operating cash flows for fiscal included earnings of million and million of net proceeds from the origination and sale of mortgage loans held for sale 
consolidated investing activities in fiscal resulted in a net cash outflow of million 
primary investing activities resulting in cash outflows were million for the purchase of securities and billion for the origination of loans receivable 
the most significant cash inflows from investing activities were principal repayments on loans of billion  proceeds of sales and maturities of investment securities of million and million of principal repayments received on mortgage related securities 
consolidated financing activities resulted in a net cash inflow of million in fiscal  including a net increase in deposits of million  a net decrease in borrowings of million and a cash outflow of million for treasury stock purchases 
contractual obligations and commitments at march   on a consolidated basis the corporation had outstanding commitments to originate million of loans  commitments to extend funds to or on behalf of customers pursuant to lines and letters of credit of million  and  of loans sold with recourse to the corporation in the event of default by the borrower 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item commitments to extend funds typically have a term of less than one year 
scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit during the twelve months following march  amounted to billion  and scheduled maturities of borrowings during the same period totaled million 
management believes adequate capital and borrowings are available from various sources to fund all commitments to the extent required

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management 
the primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide consistent net interest income growth and returns on equity while maintaining adequate liquidity over a range of interest rate environments 
to that end  management focuses on asset and liability management strategies that help reduce interest rate risk and attain the corporate goals and objectives adopted by the corporation s board of directors 
the corporation s strategy for asset and liability management is to maintain an interest rate gap that attempts to minimize the negative impact of interest rate movements on the net interest margin 
as part of this strategy  the corporation sells substantially all new originations of long term  fixed rate  single family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market  invests in adjustable rate or medium term  fixed rate  single family residential mortgage loans  invests in medium term mortgage related securities  and invests in consumer loans which generally have shorter terms to maturity and higher and or adjustable interest rates 
the corporation occasionally sells adjustable rate loans at origination to private investors 
the corporation also originates multi family residential and commercial real estate loans  which generally have adjustable or floating interest rates and or shorter terms to maturity than conventional single family residential loans 
long term  fixed rate  single family mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary market are generally committed for sale at the time the interest rate is locked with the borrower 
as such  these loans involve little interest rate risk to the corporation 
the corporation s cumulative net gap position at march  for one year or less was a positive of total assets 
the calculation of a gap position requires management to make a number of assumptions as to when an asset or liability will reprice or mature 
management believes that its assumptions approximate actual experience and considers them reasonable  although the actual amortization and repayment of assets and liabilities may vary substantially 
competitive pressures for deposits have made time deposits sensitive to interest rates and may also affect transaction accounts  in particular  passbooks and money market accounts in the future 
the corporation utilizes certain prepayment assumptions and decay rates from various sources such as the ots and as determined by management 
the following table summarizes the corporation s interest rate sensitivity gap position at march  interest rate sensitivity for the periods ended thereafter total dollars in thousands rate sensitive assets mortgage loans fixed average interest rate mortgage loans variable average interest rate consumer loans average interest rate commercial business loans average interest rate mortgage related securities average interest rate investment securities and other interest earning assets average interest rate total rate sensitive loans total rate sensitive assets

includes million of loans held for sale spread throughout the periods 
includes million of securities available for sale spread throughout the periods 
loan total and fair value amounts include respective percentages of million in deferred fees and loss reserves 
does not include million of demand accounts because they are non interest bearing 
also excludes accrued interest payable of million 
projected decay rates for demand deposits and passbook savings are selected by management from various sources such as the ots 
net interest income sensitivity 
net interest income is a primary source of revenue 
net interest income sensitivity is used to assess the interest rate risk associated with this income in various interest rate environments 
management uses the net interest income sensitivity to provide a perspective on how interest rate pricing affects the corporation s interest rate risk profile 
simulations are processed quarterly and include scenarios where market rates are immediately shocked up and down along with current and anticipated interest rate pricing of interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
the sensitivity measurement is calculated as the percentage variance of net interest income simulations to the base results 
the following table sets forth the estimated sensitivity of net interest income for months following the dates indicated 
the calculations are based on immediate changes of and points in interest rates up or down
