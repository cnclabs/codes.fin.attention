the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
executive overview we operate and manage s in two business segments our core business in financial services and the edify business in the voice speech solutions market 
we sell our solutions primarily to traditional financial services providers  such as banks and insurance companies  as well as non traditional financial providers  such as retailers 
our solutions address the needs of small  mid sized and large financial organizations 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from licensing our solutions and providing professional services 
we generate recurring revenue from support and maintenance as well as from hosting revenue related to hosting applications sold to customers in our data center revenues 
we also generate recurring revenues by charging our customers a periodic fee for term licenses including the right to use software and receive maintenance and support for a specified period of time 
in discussions with our customers and investors  we use the term subscription as being synonymous with a term license 
we intend to license enterprise platform and other next generation applications primarily on a subscription basis wherein revenue will be recognized evenly over the term of the contract 
we sell our solutions to small  mid sized and large financial organizations in two geographic regions i the americas region and ii the international region  consisting primarily of europe  the middle east region and africa emea and the asia pacific region and japan apj 
our s enterprise solutions target banks  credit unions and insurance companies 
we have over  financial institution customers  the majority of which are located in the united states 
through our edify business segment  we deliver voice and speech solutions for companies in a wide range of industries 
edify s products help companies automate their customer service facilities  improve customer satisfaction and create new revenue generating opportunities  while reducing operational costs 
edify s voice and speech applications are scalable  multilingual and flexible  allowing companies to easily integrate multiple back end systems with a variety of customer contact center applications interfaces 
edify s voice and speech solutions combine speech recognition  speaker verification  text to speech  fax  and touch tone automation with a powerful application development environment and natural language capabilities to help organizations optimize customer service while lowering costs 
in  within our financial institutions business  we generated approximately of our revenues from services provided to our major customer  state farm mutual automobile insurance company 
revenue from state farm was approximately million and million in and  respectively  and is expected to be approximately million to million in the remainder of the revenue was generated from the sale of licenses and services in the global financial services market 
in the fourth quarter of  we substantially completed a transition from our legacy internet only business to an enterprise software and services business 
during the transition  we experienced a loss or decrease of revenue from legacy internet only customers 
another major customer  zurich insurance company  whose contract with us expired on december   accounted for approximately million in revenue in  did not generate any revenue for s in in addition to zurich  we had a number of other legacy internet only customers that cancelled their hosting contracts or moved to in house implementations contributing to an estimated loss of data center revenue from to of approximately million 
we believe the majority of these data center revenue transitions were substantially completed during the third and fourth quarters of throughout and  we continued to invest in the development of the integrated s enterprise platform as the technology foundation for the s enterprise family of products 
in  we released for general availability additional applications for the s enterprise platform including retail internet banking  small business internet banking  corporate cash management and branch automation 
the third major release of s enterprise  in august  added a number of new 
table of contents applications to the s enterprise platform  including s enterprise teller  s enterprise sales and service platform  s enterprise call center  s enterprise voice powered by edify and s enterprise analytics and for the first time  all the s enterprise applications operated on the same integrated technology platform 
as of december   over seventy five financial institutions are in production mode with a hosted or on premise s enterprise solution and over one hundred and fifty financial institutions have purchased one or more of our enterprise applications 
historically  we have not capitalized software development costs because of the insignificant amount of costs incurred between technological feasibility and general customer release 
if the amount of time between the completion of beta testing and general customer release lengthens  we may be required to capitalize certain software development costs in the future 
during the first quarter of  we entered into long term distribution agreements with two international financial services solution providers 
we believe these agreements will expand our distribution and delivery capacity in emea  asia and latin america regions 
we did not record any revenues from these agreements until the fourth quarter of these relationships require time to train their personnel on our products and to build a sales pipeline 
we expect to increase international revenues through these reseller agreements 
during the fourth quarter of  we extended our relationships to include additional products 
excluding merger related costs and restructuring charges of million in and million in  our total operating expenses were million in  million in and million in during and  we focused on activities to reduce our total operating costs in each of our business segments in order to align our operating costs with our expected revenues 
in  we reorganized our worldwide operations by reducing the work force  relocating and consolidating certain office facilities and selling certain corporate assets 
in connection with these activities  we recorded restructuring charges of million during the year ended december  in total  we eliminated approximately positions worldwide and closed or consolidated several office facilities 
the reorganization of our businesses was substantially complete as of december  we continue to look for additional ways to streamline our global operations and continue to use a disciplined approach to control costs throughout our organization 
business acquisitions in the fourth quarter of  we acquired mosaic software holdings  limited  a united kingdom based provider of solutions that drive atms and electronic payment networks 
we believe the acquisition will add a leading financial transaction solution to s s suite of products and will enable s to offer financial services providers an atm channel solution along with the s enterprise integrated front office suite 
we paid cash consideration of million upon the closing of the transaction and committed to pay up to an additional million in cash for earn out payments upon mosaic achieving certain financial metrics during its fiscal year ending may  in the third quarter of  we acquired x net associates  inc  a rochester  new york based provider of lending solutions 
we believe this acquisition will strengthen our product offering around lending solutions and accelerate the development of additional lending functionality 
in september  we announced general availability of our s lending solutions product 
we paid cash consideration of million for this business 
under the agreement  additional consideration may be paid to one shareholder of x net  who is also an s employee  if certain financial metrics are achieved 
there is a maximum of million that can be earned in the period from august  through july  and million that can be earned in the period from august  through july  in the second quarter of  we purchased a business unit from vmoksha technologies  private limited in order to establish a wholly owned software development center in pune  india 
previously  this business unit provided software development  programming and other related services for s we believe this acquisition will reduce our costs and provide greater flexibility and control over the quality of the development and professional services efforts from this center 
we paid cash consideration of approximately million for the business unit 
revenue from significant customers revenues from state farm were  and of our financial institution revenues and  and of our revenues from continuing operations during the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenues from state farm for the year ended december  increased approximately million from we expect state farm to contribute approximately to of our financial institution segment revenue for 
table of contents zurich accounted for and of our revenues from our financial institutions segment and and of our total revenues during the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   we did not have any revenue from zurich 
restructuring charges in  we reorganized our worldwide operations by reducing the work force  relocating and consolidating certain office facilities and selling certain corporate assets 
in connection with these activities  we recorded restructuring charges of million during the year ended december  in total  we eliminated approximately positions worldwide and closed or consolidated office facilities 
in the domestic operations of our financial institution segment  we recorded million in restructuring charges during the year ended december   which were primarily comprised of charges for severance costs associated with headcount reductions  lease payments associated with excess office space and other corporate charges 
in  we consolidated our uk data center operations into our global hosting center in atlanta  relocated our remaining uk operations to a smaller facility  decreased our workforce both in our european and apj operations and closed offices in our apj operations 
as a result  in  we recorded restructuring charges of million in our european operations and million in our apj operations 
these charges were comprised of accelerated depreciation of assets  severance costs  other related costs to relocate the data center operations  losses on the vacated office space and the write off of abandoned leasehold improvements 
in the third quarter of  we completed the process of reorganizing our edify business to align costs with expected revenues 
we reduced the workforce and closed and consolidated several edify office facilities worldwide 
we recorded restructuring charges of million for the year ended december  as a result of these activities 
in  we recorded a charge of million for excess office space in our edify business 
we undertook these restructuring activities in and to streamline our worldwide operations following a period of multiple business acquisitions  and to reduce our operating expenses to a level that we believe is appropriate based on our estimate of future revenues 
we achieved cost savings from these activities throughout the geographic and functional areas of our operating segments 
for additional information about these restructuring activities  including a tabular presentation of our restructuring charges  see note to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
we expect to make future cash expenditures  net of anticipated sublease income  related to these restructuring activities of approximately million  of which we expect to pay million within the next twelve months 
adjustments to the restructuring accrual may be recorded in the future due to changes in estimates of lease termination reserves arising from changing real estate market conditions 
merger related costs in  we decreased our merger related reserve for legal claims by million  which was established in connection with our acquisition of fics group  nv in november we were able to resolve two legal matters during for less than previously estimated 
additionally in  we reduced our merger related accrual by million when we determined that we had an alternate use for excess office space that was reserved when we completed the acquisition of point in march during  we incurred merger related costs of million in connection with the acquisition of point 
these costs  incurred in connection with our plan to reorganize certain of our european operations  included headcount reduction  consolidation of s and acquired point office facilities and disposal of redundant or obsolete computer equipment 
this merger related charge was partially offset by a million decrease in reserves for legal claims  which was established in connection with our acquisition of fics group  nv in november we were able to resolve this legal matter during the first quarter of for less than previously estimated amounts 
our restructuring and merger related reserves include provisions for obligations for unused real estate less estimates for sub lease income 
in  we were able to secure a sublease for one of our foreign properties at terms that were million more favorable than previously anticipated 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
table of contents of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
generally  we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under other assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are those that we consider the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies include those related to revenue recognition  estimation of our allowance for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments  valuation and recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill  determination of technological feasibility and capitalization of software development costs  recognition of costs in connection with restructuring plans and merger related activities  and reserve for contingencies 
revenue recognition 
revenue is a key component of our results of operations and is a key metric used by management  securities analysts and investors to evaluate our performance 
our revenue arrangements generally include multiple elements such as license fees for software products  installation services  customization services  training services  post contract customer support  data center services and  in some cases  hardware or other third party products 
software license revenue 
we recognize software license sales in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  and sop no 
 modification of sop no 
with respect to certain transactions  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants 
for software license sales for which any services rendered are not considered essential to the functionality of the software  we recognize revenue upon delivery of the software provided there is evidence of an arrangement  collection of our fee is considered probable and the fee is fixed or determinable 
in certain of these arrangements  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists to allocate the total fee to all elements of the arrangement 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the delivered element and exists for all undelivered elements  we use the residual method under sop no 
when the professional services are considered essential to the functionality of the software  we record revenue for the license and professional services over the implementation period using the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of labor hours incurred to date to estimated total labor hours for each contract 
for software licenses where the license term does not begin until installation is complete  we recognize license and professional services revenue when we complete the installation of the software 
for subscription license arrangements where we sell customers the rights to unspecified products as well as unspecified upgrades and enhancements during a specified term  the license revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
for license arrangements in which the fee is not considered fixed or determinable  the license revenue is recognized as payments become due 
support and maintenance revenue 
revenues for post contract customer support and maintenance are recognized ratably over the contract period 
professional services revenue 
revenues derived from arrangements to provide professional services on a time and materials basis are recognized as the related services are performed 
revenues from professional services provided on a fixed fee basis are recognized using the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of labor hours incurred to date to estimated total labor hours for the contract 
data center revenue 
we recognize data center revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we also consider the applicability of emerging issues task force issue no 
 application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  to our data center arrangements on a contract by contract basis 
if it is determined that a software element covered by sop no 

table of contents is present in a hosting arrangement  the license  professional services and data center revenue is recognized pursuant to sop no 
if it is determined that a software element covered by sop no 
is not present in a hosting arrangement  we recognize revenue for the arrangement pursuant to sab no 
and eitf see a full discussion of our revenue recognition policies in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our contractual arrangements are evaluated on a contract by contract basis and often require our judgment and estimates that affect the classification and timing of revenue recognized in our statements of operations 
specifically  we may be required to make judgments about whether the fees associated with our products and services are fixed or determinable  whether or not collection of our fees is reasonably assured  whether professional services are essential to the functionality of the related software product  whether we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates in the application of the percentage of completion method  and whether we have verifiable objective evidence of fair value for our products and services 
additionally  we may be required to make the following estimates percentage of labor hours incurred to date to the estimated total labor hours for each contract  provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts  and the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts or billing adjustments 
if other judgments or assumptions were used in the evaluation of our revenue arrangements  the timing and amounts of revenue recognized may have been significantly different 
for instance  many of our revenue arrangements are accounted for using the percentage of completion method since the services are considered essential to the functionality of the software 
if it was determined that those services were not essential to the functionality of the software  we may have recognized the license revenue upon delivery of the license  provided other required criteria were satisfied 
further  if we determined that we cannot make reasonably dependable estimates in the application of the percentage of completion method  we would defer all revenue and recognize it upon completion of the contract 
estimation of allowance for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments 
we are required to report accounts receivable at the amount we expect to collect from our customers 
as a result  we are required to use our judgment to estimate the likelihood that certain receivables may not be collected or that we might offer future discounts or concessions for previously billed amounts 
as a result  we have established a discount allowance for estimated billing adjustments and a bad debt allowance for estimated amounts that we will not collect 
we report provisions for billing adjustments as a reduction of revenue and provisions for bad debts as a component of selling expense 
we review specific accounts for collectibility based on circumstances known to us at the date of our financial statements 
in addition  we maintain reserves based on historical billing adjustments and write offs 
these estimates are based on historical discounts  concessions and bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms 
accordingly  our judgments and estimates about the collectibility of our accounts receivable affect revenue  selling expense and the carrying value of our accounts receivable 
valuation and recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill 
we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount should be assessed by comparing their carrying value to the undiscounted estimated future net operating cash flows expected to be derived from such assets 
if such evaluation indicates a potential impairment  we use discounted cash flows to measure fair value in determining the amount of the long lived assets that should be written off 
for long term cost and equity investments  we write down their carrying values if it is determined that an impairment is other than temporary 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 

table of contents in  we sold one cost basis investment at a loss of approximately million 
if other assumptions and estimates were used in our evaluations  the timing and amount of the charges may have been significantly different 
at december   the carrying value of these investments was million 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets which we adopted on january   requires us to perform an annual test of goodwill value to determine whether or not it has been impaired 
based on the results of our initial and annual tests  except as explained in the following paragraph  the fair value of our reporting units exceeds their carrying value 
while we no longer record amortization expense for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  future events and changes in circumstances may require us to record a significant impairment charge in any given period 
in the first quarter of  we terminated our efforts to divest the edify business 
we considered our inability to sell the edify business on terms that were acceptable to us a triggering event under sfas no 
and that required us to perform a current assessment of the carrying value of the edify business 
based on our current analysis of fair value for the edify business  including estimates we based on discounted future cash flows  market valuations of comparable businesses and offers from potential buyers  we concluded that the fair value of the edify business was less than its carrying value 
accordingly  we allocated our estimate of fair value for the unit to the existing assets and liabilities of the edify business as of march   resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of million and accelerated amortization on other intangible assets developed technology and customer base and purchased software of million and million  respectively 
valuation of acquired businesses 
in  we made three acquisitions 
we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at date of acquisition 
prior to this allocation  we are required to identify intangible assets and assign a value to these intangible assets based on their fair value 
determining the fair value of identifiable intangible assets requires management to estimate future cash flows for the related assets and the useful life of such assets 
the excess of the cost of the acquired business over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 
intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and goodwill is evaluated on an annual basis 
consequently  our estimates determine the timing and the amount of expense recognized in our financial statements 
determination of technological feasibility and capitalization of software development costs 
we are required to assess when technological feasibility occurs for products that we develop 
based on our judgment  we have determined that technological feasibility for our products generally occurs when we complete beta testing 
because of the insignificant amount of costs incurred between completion of beta testing and general customer release  we have not capitalized any software development costs in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
if we determined that technological feasibility had occurred at an earlier point in the development cycle and that subsequent production costs incurred before general availability of the product were significant  we would have capitalized those costs and recognized them over future periods 
we continue to monitor changes in the software development cycle and may be required to capitalize certain software development costs in the future 
recognition of costs in connection with restructuring plans and merger related activities 
during the last three years  we recorded charges in connection with various restructuring activities 
additionally  we recorded merger related charges related to a reorganization of our european operations in connection with the acquisition of point in the second quarter of see further discussion of the terms of these charges in note to the consolidated financial statements 
following the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we establish a liability for the estimated fair value of exit costs at the date we incur a liability under an approved restructuring plan 
at that time  and thereafter until the plan activities are complete  the actual costs or timing of payments associated with the plan may differ from our estimates 
we use our judgment and information available to us at the date of the financial statements to reevaluate our initial estimates of the exit costs 
if we believe that our previous estimates of exit costs or timing of payments are no longer accurate in light of current conditions  we adjust the liability with a corresponding increase or decrease to current period earnings 
any adjustments to estimates of our exit costs under restructuring plans are reflected on the same line item in the statement of operations as the initial charge to establish the restructuring liability 
additionally  in periods subsequent to the initial measurement  we increase the carrying amount of the liability by the amount of accretion recorded as an expense due to the passage of time 
accrued restructuring costs at december  reflect our estimate of the fair value of future rental obligations and other costs associated with office space that we do not plan to use in our operations as a result of the restructuring plans  offset by our estimate of the fair value of sublease income for this space 
the determination of fair value is based on a discounted future 
table of contents cash flow model using a credit adjusted risk free rate 
while we know the terms of our contractual lease obligations and related future commitments  we must estimate when and under what terms we will be able to sublet the office space  if at all 
such estimates require a substantial amount of judgment  especially given current real estate market conditions 
actual sublease terms may differ substantially from our estimates 
any future changes in our estimates of lease termination reserves could materially impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in connection with the acquisition of certain businesses  we established reserves for certain contingencies that existed at the date of acquisition 
at that time  we believed that the resolution of the contingency would result in future cash expenditures that we estimated based on the information available at the date of acquisition 
as those contingencies are resolved  we reduce the related liabilities for any related cash disbursements or if we determine that the contingency is no longer likely to result in a loss 
reserve for contingencies 
when a loss contingency exists  we are required to evaluate the likelihood that a future event or events will confirm the loss 
sfas no 
accounting for contingencies states that a company must accrue for a loss contingency by a charge to income when information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements  and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
income taxes 
we have recorded a valuation allowance on our most of our deferred tax assets 
if we sustain profitability during  we may make a determination to reverse the valuation allowance related to domestic net operating loss carryforwards in the latter part of or early in order to reverse any portion of the valuation allowance  we are required to make estimates regarding our future earnings and the recoverability of the domestic net operating loss carryforwards 
a portion of this reversal could have a positive impact on our income tax benefit and our earnings in the period in which it is reversed 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the emerging issue task force eitf reached consensus on eitf issue no 
 participating securities and the two class method under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 earnings per share 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance in applying the two class method of calculating earnings per share and clarifies what constitutes a participating security 
the consensus significantly expands the notion of participation right from previous practice 
eitf issue no 
is effective for fiscal periods beginning after march  we have adopted eitf issue no 
as of april   with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we determined that our preferred shares outstanding are participating securities as defined in eitf issue no 
and we have restated prior period earnings per share amounts to ensure comparability 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas r which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas sfas r requires all share based payments to employees to be recognized in the income statement based on their grant date fair values over the corresponding service period and also requires an estimation of forfeitures when calculating compensation expense 
we will adopt sfas no 
r on july  using the modified prospective method 
we expect to record stock based compensation expense of between million and million during the six months ended december  in december the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fsp fas no 
 application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of the american jobs creation act of introduces a special tax deduction of up to percent when fully phased in  of the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income 
fsp fas clarifies that this tax deduction should be accounted for as a special tax deduction in accordance with sfas no 
although fsp fas no 
was effective upon issuance  we are still evaluating the impact fsp fas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements

table of contents comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenues 
the following table sets forth selected revenue data for the years ended december  and software support and professional licenses maintenance services data center other total year ended december  financial institutions  excluding zurich zurich financial institutions edify eliminations total year ended december  financial institutions  excluding zurich zurich financial institutions edify eliminations total total revenues decreased by million to million for compared to million for  a decrease of 
this decrease is attributable to a million decrease in software license revenue and a million decrease in data center revenues  offset in part by a million increase in customer support revenue and million increase in professional services revenue 
our financial institutions segment generated million of revenue in compared to million for  a decrease of 
revenues from our edify business segment were million for  a increase from million in below is a detailed discussion of changes in revenue by revenue type 
software license revenues for our financial institutions segment were million for  a million decrease from this decrease was attributable to the loss of license revenue earned from zurich of million for  offset in part by license revenues earned from sales of new customers and cross sales to existing customers 
the zurich revenue was earned from a subscription license that expired in december excluding license revenues from zurich  license revenues increased million or 
in  we will license enterprise platform version and future versions as well as certain other applications primarily on a subscription basis wherein license revenue will be recognized evenly over the term of the contract 
during  we recorded million of subscription license revenue 
during  we expect to continue to sell our non enterprise on a perpetual license basis 
the amount of license revenue growth in may vary significantly depending on the mix of perpetual to subscription licenses sold 
software license revenues for our edify business segment were million for  an increase of million from this increase resulted from several new large contracts signed during  improved economic conditions in the primary markets served by edify telecommunications  travel and retail and the stabilization of the business under new management 
support and maintenance revenues for our financial institution segment were million for  an increase of million or from million in the increase is primarily attributable to support and maintenance fees earned from new and existing customers who purchased licenses during and  partially offset by the attrition of legacy internet only customers 
we believe that the attrition of legacy customers was substantially complete at december  and that support and maintenance revenues from our financial institutions segment will continue to grow on a sequential quarter basis 
additionally  the acquisition of mosaic in the fourth quarter of will contribute to the growth in support and maintenance revenues in support and maintenance revenues for the edify business were million for  an increase from million for the growth in resulted from support and maintenance fees from customers who purchased new or add on licenses in and 
table of contents professional services revenues from our financial institution segment were million for  a million increase from million for related to the growth in non zurich license revenues in the sales of these licenses generally include the sale of professional services for implementation and other services 
although we expect revenues from professional services to vary quarter to quarter  we believe professional services revenues from our financial institutions segment will grow during  as revenues from new projects will replace revenues lost to the completion of current projects 
the edify business recorded million of revenue for professional services for compared to million for during  license sales in the edify business were heavily weighted to sales through distributors 
professional services associated with these license sales are generally provided by the distributor 
we expect professional services to remain stable in data center revenues were million for  a decrease of million for the decrease resulted primarily from the loss of data center revenues from zurich as discussed in the executive overview in this was offset by increases in the number of hosted customers 
as we add hosted customers on our s enterprise products and our existing customer base grows  we expect data center revenues to increase on a sequential quarter basis throughout other revenues are primarily related to the sale of third party hardware and software that is used in connection with our products 
other revenue fluctuates based on the mix of products and services sold and is not typical in our sales arrangements 
the related cost of the hardware sold is included in cost of other revenue as the hardware is delivered 
there is only minimal gross margin associated with other revenue 
direct costs and gross margins 
direct costs decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for overall gross margins were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect gross margins to range between and during  depending on the mix of license and services revenues 
the overall decrease in direct costs and corresponding increase in gross margins is a result of a lower cost base as discussed below 
direct costs exclude charges for depreciation of property and equipment and the amortization of purchased technology 
costs of software licenses principally consist of royalties paid to third parties 
historically  royalties paid on our financial institution software product sales have been minimal because we internally develop most of the software components  the cost of which is reflected in product development expense as it is incurred 
we anticipate that costs of software licenses will increase in future periods as we license and install more of our new s enterprise products because these products include some software components that we license from third parties  however  the costs of software licenses will continue to vary with the mix of products sold 
software licenses costs for our financial institutions segment increased to million in from million in the overall increase in cost of software licenses was primarily related to increased license sales excluding zurich which had no software license costs in 
software license costs for the edify business were million in and gross margins for software licenses for the edify business increased from in to in due to a reduction in the cost of third party voice recognition software 

table of contents costs of professional services  support and maintenance consist primarily of personnel and related infrastructure costs 
direct costs associated with professional services  support and maintenance were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from million for the same period in million of the decrease from was caused by net additional charges of million on services projects that were accrued in the first  second and fourth quarters of and partially released or reduced in the third quarter of these loss accruals reflect the amounts by which our then anticipated future project costs would exceed the remaining unrecognized contractual revenues for those projects 
in  we reduced these loss accruals by approximately million  as a result of a combination of additional project funding and reductions in the estimated hours to complete the project and changes in the project scope from one customer  and clarification of project scope and resulting changes in cost projections for certain other loss projects 
margins for professional services  support and maintenance were and for and  respectively 
costs of data center consist of personnel costs  facility costs and related infrastructure costs to support our data center business 
direct data center costs decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease is primarily attributable to the cost savings realized from consolidation of the uk data center into our global hosting center in atlanta  georgia during and million of accelerated costs during the first half of related to the closing of the u 
k data center 
as a result of the cost savings from the consolidation of locations and an increase in data center revenue excluding zurich  data center margins increased from in to in data center margins are expected to increase in related to revenue growth and cost containment 
selling and marketing 
for the year ended december   selling and marketing expenses decreased million to million from million in selling and marketing expenses decreased million and million in our financial institutions and edify segments  respectively 
these decreases are primarily attributable to a reduction in bad debt expense and reduced sales and marketing headcount resulting in a decrease in compensation expense  other payroll related costs and benefits and travel and entertainment expenses  offset in part by an increase in the cost of marketing programs 
product development 
total product development expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in product development headcount and the increased use of outside contractors 
in and  product development expenses were and of revenue 
we expect this percentage to decrease in historically we have not capitalized software development costs because of the insignificant amount of costs incurred between technological feasibility and general customer release 
however  if the amount of time between the completion of beta testing and general customer release lengthens  we may be required to capitalize certain software development costs in the future 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for  an increase of million or 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased slightly to for the year ended december  from for the same period in the increase in general and administrative expenses is attributable to an increase in professional accounting fees related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and legal fees related to corporate development activities and litigation matters in which we were involved in  offset in part by a decrease in compensation and benefits from lower headcount and lower discretionary spending as a result of cost containment initiatives undertaken during the second half of depreciation 
depreciation decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million in  due to reductions in capital expenditures during recent periods as compared with those made in and a significant portion of those items that we purchased in became fully depreciated by the end of we expect depreciation expense to be approximately million per quarter in merger related and restructuring costs 
during  we did not incur any merger related costs and restructuring charges compared to million for during  we undertook several initiatives to align our worldwide cost structure with our anticipated revenues 
as a result  we reduced the work force  relocated and consolidated certain office facilities and sold certain corporate assets 
in addition we consolidated our emea data center operations based in the united kingdom into our global hosting center in 
table of contents atlanta 
in connection with these plans  we recorded restructuring charges of million during the year ended december  in total  we eliminated approximately positions worldwide and closed or consolidated office facilities 
in the domestic operations of our financial institution segment  we recorded million in restructuring charges during  which were primarily comprised of charges for severance costs associated with headcount reductions  lease payments associated with excess office space and other corporate charges 
during  we reorganized our international operations 
we consolidated our uk data center operations into our global hosting center in atlanta  relocated our remaining uk operations to a smaller facility  decreased our workforce both in our european and apj operations and closed offices in our apj operations 
as a result  in the year ended december   we recorded restructuring charges of million in our european operations and million in our apj operations 
these charges were comprised of accelerated depreciation of assets  severance costs  other related costs to relocate the data center operations  losses on the vacated office space and the write off of abandoned leasehold improvements 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 we recorded the loss on vacated office space at the present value of the expected cash flows 
in the third quarter of  we completed the process of reorganizing our edify business to align costs with expected revenues 
as a result  we hired a new general manager  replaced the entire senior management team  reduced the workforce and closed and consolidated several edify office facilities worldwide 
these actions resulted in restructuring charges of million for the year ended december  in  we decreased our merger related reserve for legal claims by million  which was established in connection with our acquisition of fics group  nv in november we were able to resolve two legal matters during for less than previously estimated 
in the second quarter of  we further reduced our merger related accrual by million when we determined that we had an alternate use for excess office space that was reserved when we completed the acquisition of point in march amortization and impairment of acquisition intangible assets 
amortization and impairment of acquisition intangible assets decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in in april  we terminated our efforts to divest the edify business 
we considered our inability to sell the edify business on terms that were acceptable to us a triggering event under sfas no 
and that required us to perform a current assessment of the carrying value of the edify business 
based on our current analysis of fair value for the edify business  including estimates we based on discounted future cash flows  market valuations of comparable businesses and offers from potential buyers  we concluded that the fair value of the edify business was less than its carrying value 
accordingly  we allocated our estimate of fair value for the unit to the existing assets and liabilities of the edify business as of march   resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of million and accelerated amortization on other intangible assets and purchased software of million and million  respectively 
interest  investment and other income expense 
interest  investment and other expense  net was million for the year ended december   a decrease from income of million from realized foreign currency translation loss was million and million in and  respectively 
in  we recorded a loss of million on the sale of an investment that we accounted for on a cost basis and in  we recorded a million expense for a loss in an equity method investment 
income tax benefit expense 
we recorded income tax expense of million during the year ended december  compared to million in although we have fully reserved net deferred tax assets of approximately million as of december  primarily related to our net operating loss carryforwards nols and tax credit carryforwards from time to time we are required to record an income tax provision in periods for tax expense in certain subsidiaries or jurisdictions for which do not have nols to utilize  in the united states due to limitations on the use of our federal nols for alternative minimum tax purposes which will be paid in cash  or if there are nols that were acquired as part of a business combination  upon which we placed a valuation allowance at acquisition date 
this results in non cash income tax expense as goodwill is reduced and the valuation allowance is released 

table of contents we incurred foreign income tax expense in certain european countries in and in  we recorded alternative minimum tax expense for our domestic operations as a result of limitations on the use of our federal nols 
approximately million of our income tax expense in resulted from the release of the valuation allowance against pre acquisition nols and does not represent anticipated cash taxes to be paid 
at december   we had a valuation allowance of million on our deferred tax assets 
if we continue to sustain profitability during  we may make a determination to reverse the valuation allowance related to domestic net operating loss carryforwards in the latter part of or early a portion of this reversal could have a positive impact on our income tax benefit and our earnings in the period in which it is reversed 
loss from discontinued operations 
we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of million in the year ended december  as compared to a loss of million for the ten month period we owned davidge in the improvement of million in results from discontinued operations is primarily related to a million charge taken for loss contingencies established in the fourth quarter of  an increase in revenues and a decrease in operating expenses

the following table sets forth selected revenue data for the years ended december  and software support and professional data licenses maintenance services center other total year ended december  financial institutions  excluding zurich zurich financial institutions edify eliminations total year ended december  financial institutions  excluding zurich zurich financial institutions edify eliminations total total revenues decreased by million to million for compared to million for  a decrease of 
this decrease is attributable to a million decrease in software license revenue and a million decrease in professional services revenue  offset in part by a million increase in data center revenues 
our financial institutions segment generated million of revenue in compared to million for  a decrease of 
revenues from our edify business segment were million for  a decrease from million in below is a detailed discussion of changes in revenue by revenue type 
software license revenues for our financial institutions segment were million for  a million decrease from license revenue earned from zurich was million for and million for this revenue was earned from a subscription license that expired in december we will not earn any license revenue from zurich in and beyond 
license revenues declined in primarily due to an increase in the number of contracts signed that required accounting for under the percentage of completion method based on the terms of the agreement 
as a result  license revenues for these contracts are generally recognized over time as the related implementation and customization services are provided  as opposed to up front when the software is delivered in accordance with statement of position no 

table of contents software license revenues for our edify business segment were million for  a decrease of million from we believe the following items contributed to the decrease poor economic conditions in the primary markets served by edify telecommunications  travel and retail and the impact on the business of the reorganization activities 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we experienced an improvement in edify sales activity as the business began to stabilize under new management 
support and maintenance revenues for our financial institution segment were million for  an increase of million or from million in this increase is attributable to new customer maintenance contracts signed from customers who purchased new licenses in and  partially offset by the attrition from our internet only legacy customers and a million decrease in support and maintenance fees earned from zurich 
support and maintenance revenues for the edify business were million for  a decrease from million for due principally to customer attrition 
the reduction in maintenance is directly related to the downturn in the economy during and  which saw a certain portion of edify s base of customers discontinue maintenance or shut down applications altogether 
professional services revenues from our financial institution segment were million for  a million decrease from million for the decrease is primarily attributable to the million decrease in professional services revenues from state farm and a million decrease in professional services revenues from zurich 
the edify business recorded million of revenue for professional services for compared to million for this decrease is attributable to the decrease in software sales and related implementation projects 
data center revenues were million for  an increase of million from the increase resulted primarily from the acceleration of data center revenues from zurich as discussed in the overview 
increases in data center revenues from new and existing clients were nearly offset by other reductions in transitioning legacy customer revenues as discussed in the overview 
this transition was completed by the end of other revenues are primarily related to the sale of third party hardware and software that is used in connection with our products 
other revenue fluctuates based on the mix of products and services sold and is not typical in our sales arrangements 
in  we recorded million in revenue for third party hardware delivered from inventory to one financial institution customer 
the related cost of the hardware sold is included in cost of other revenue as the hardware is delivered 
there is only minimal gross margin associated with other revenue 
direct costs and gross margins 
direct costs decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for overall gross margins were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the overall decrease in direct costs was principally due to a million reduction in cost of professional services  support and maintenance related to lower staffing levels and reduced facilities costs resulting from the consolidation of offices and a decrease in royalties and other third party fees paid on a lower base of sales especially in the edify business 
these decreases were offset in part by the establishment of accruals for professional services costs  as discussed below  and the cost of the pass through hardware approximately million delivered to one customer in the decrease in gross margins was primarily due to the mix of revenue earned and a decrease in gross margins for professional services  support and maintenance  from in to in software license revenues represented and of total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
historically  the gross margins on software licenses have been higher than the gross margins on professional service  support and maintenance and data center fees 
therefore  a significant decrease in license revenues as a percentage of total sales negatively affects the overall gross margin percentages 
gross margins on professional services decreased as the amount of revenue from state farm decreased 
direct costs exclude charges for depreciation of property and equipment and the amortization of purchased technology 
costs of software licenses principally consist of royalties paid to third parties 
historically  royalties paid on our financial institution software product sales have been minimal because we internally develop most of the software components  the cost of which is reflected in product development expense as it is incurred 

table of contents software licenses costs for our financial institutions segment increased to million in from million in  resulting from a higher volume of product sales including third party software components 
software license costs for the edify business decreased to million in from million in due to the decrease in product sales and a reduction in the cost of third party voice recognition software 
costs of professional services  support and maintenance consist primarily of personnel and related infrastructure costs 
direct costs associated with professional services  support and maintenance were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from this decrease resulted from reductions in professional services headcount  outside contractors and associated facilities costs to a level that is more closely aligned with the projects and services under contract 
this decrease was partially offset by the accrual of approximately million for the estimated future costs to complete service projects where our expected costs will exceed the contractual revenues 
gross margins for professional services and customer support and maintenance increased due to the revenue mix between lower margin professional services and higher margin support revenues 
costs of data center consist of personnel costs  facility costs and related infrastructure costs to support our data center business 
direct data center costs were million for the years ended december  and the acceleration of data center costs of million in the first and second quarters of associated with the amendment of the zurich contract  as well as the incremental costs incurred to the transfer the remaining data center business from the uk to our global hosting center in atlanta  georgia was offset by the cost savings from this consolidation during the second half of selling and marketing 
for the year ended december   selling and marketing expenses decreased million to million from million in selling and marketing expenses decreased million and million in our financial institutions and edify segments  respectively  as a result of headcount reductions and the related decrease in compensation expense  other payroll related expense and benefits  and travel expenses

these costs  incurred in connection with our plan to reorganize certain of our european operations  include headcount reduction  consolidation of s and acquired point office facilities and disposal of redundant or obsolete computer equipment 
this merger related charge was partially offset by a million decrease in reserves for legal claims  which was established in connection with our acquisition of fics group  nv in november we were able to resolve this legal matter during the first quarter of for less than previously estimated 
additionally  in  we recorded a charge of million for some excess office space in our edify business 
acquired in process research and development 
in connection with the purchase price allocation for the regency and point acquisitions during the year ended december   we allocated million to acquired in process research and development  which we expensed immediately in accordance with the applicable accounting rules 
amortization and impairment of acquisition intangible assets 
amortization and impairment of acquisition intangible assets decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in in april  we terminated our efforts to divest the edify business

valuation of acquired businesses for the acquisitions of mosaic  x net and the indian business unit  we allocated the respective purchase prices to the net assets or liabilities of the businesses  identifiable intangible assets if any and goodwill 
for mosaic and x net  we identified customer relationship and developed technology intangible assets 
these assets were valued using the income approach to fair value 
we did not identify any in process research and development for these acquisitions 
for the third acquisition  we did not identify any identifiable intangible assets 
acquired in process research and development in connection with the acquisitions of regency and point  we allocated a portion of the respective purchase prices to acquired in process research and development based on appraisals prepared by independent valuation consultants 
we determined the fair value of in process research and development for each of the above acquisitions using an income approach 
this involved estimating the present value of the after tax cash flows expected to be generated by the purchased in process research and development  using risk adjusted discount rates and revenue forecasts as appropriate 
estimates of future cash flows related to the in process research and development were made for each project based on our estimates of revenue  operating expenses and income taxes from the project 
these estimates were consistent with historical pricing  margins and expense levels for similar products 
revenues were estimated based on relevant market size and growth factors  expected industry trends  individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of each product s underlying technology 
estimated operating expenses  income taxes and charges for the use of contributory assets were deducted from estimated revenues to determine estimated after tax cash flows for each project 
estimated operating expenses include cost of goods sold  selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses 
the research and development expenses include estimated costs to maintain the products once they have been introduced into the market 
the selection of the discount rate was based on consideration of our weighted average cost of capital  as well as factors including the useful life of each technology  profitability levels of each technology  the uncertainty of technology advances that were known at the time  and the stage of completion of each technology 
we believe that the estimated in process research and development amounts represent fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would have paid for the projects 
at the date of acquisition  the in process research and development projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  the values allocated to these projects were immediately expensed upon acquisition 
where appropriate  we deducted an amount reflecting the contribution of developed technology to the anticipated cash flows of in process research and development projects 
the acquisitions and related in process research and development expenses are detailed in the table below in process costs to company acquisition date purchase price r d expense complete in millions regency systems february  point march  at the date of acquisition  regency was working on an ivr system for the nt platform  known as v although this technology includes all of the same features of the developed system  it is based on an entirely new code  and includes additional features 
we released this new product at the end of within the estimated costs and timeline used in the valuation 
as of the acquisition date  point had two projects under development e point version for windows nt and e point version for unix 
e point version incorporates additional functionalities to the existing platform 
at the time of acquisition  conceptualization for version was complete  however it had not progressed through the development cycle 

table of contents e point unix has the same features as existing point technology  but for use as interconnectivity with unix operating systems 
at the time of acquisition  the coding  prototyping and stabilization of the e point unix project was not complete

operating activities 
during the year ended december   cash used for operations was million compared to cash provided by operations of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
changes in operating assets and liabilities  especially trade accounts receivable  trade accounts payable and accrued expenses  are generally the result of timing differences between the collection of fees billed and payment of operating expenses

short term investments consist of investments in certificates of deposit  commercial paper and other highly liquid securities with original maturities exceeding days but less than one year 
short term investments also includes certain auction rate securities that have been reclassified from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments 
we had historically classified these instruments as cash and cash equivalents if the period between the interest rate resets was days or less  which was based on our ability to either liquidate our holding or roll our investments over to the next reset period 
based on our re evaluation of the maturity dates associated with the underlying bonds  we have reclassified our auction rate securities  previously classified as cash and cash equivalents  as short term investments for each of the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
auction rate securities are variable rate bonds tied to short term interest rates with maturities on the face of the securities in excess of days 
auction rate securities have interest rate resets through a modified dutch auction  at predetermined short term intervals  usually every  or days 
they generally trade at par and are callable at par on any interest payment date at the option of the issuer 
interest paid during a given period is based upon the interest rate determined through the auction process 
although these securities are issued and rated as long term bonds  they are priced and traded as short term instruments because of the liquidity provided through the interest rate reset 
all short term investments are available for sale and are reported at amortized cost 
we converted a net million of short term investments to cash in we made net investments of million and million in short term investments in and  respectively 
we purchased million  million  and million of property and equipment in   and  respectively 
our property and equipment purchases are primarily related to computer equipment

in  we received proceeds of million for the sale of certain assets and investment securities 
in  we invested in a million certificate of deposit 
because its remaining maturity exceeded one year at december   it was classified on our balance sheet in other assets 
the remaining maturity for this investment is less than one year at december   accordingly  it is classified on our balance sheet in short term investments 
financing activities 
cash used for financing activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to cash provided by financing activities of million and cash used in financing activities of million for the years ended december  and respectively 
in july  our board of directors approved a million stock repurchase program 
this program was completed in the first quarter of in october  our board of directors approved a million stock repurchase program 
the principle objective of the stock repurchase plan is to offset dilution of our common stock from shares granted under our employee stock option plans 
these programs were and continue to be funded from available cash and short term investments 
in the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million 
in the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million 
in the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million under this program 
as of december   we are 
table of contents authorized to repurchase additional common stock up to million 
we expect to execute purchases of our common stock under this plan throughout in  and  we received million  million and million from the sale of common stock under our employee stock plans  respectively 
we paid million  million  and million for capital lease obligations in  and  respectively 
as of december   we do not have any borrowing arrangements 
commitments 
in connection with the lease of certain offices  we issued standby letters of credit in the amount of million to guarantee certain obligations under the lease agreements 
the amount of the letter of credit reduces as our rent obligation declines 
at december   there were no drawings outstanding under the letter of credit 
we lease office space and computer equipment under non cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through as a result of the consolidation of our offices over the past few years  we have entered into non cancelable sub lease agreements for certain of our properties 
we also lease certain computer equipment under capital lease arrangements 
in the normal course of business  we enter into contracts with vendors 
some of these contracts include provisions for fixed or minimum purchase quantities 
these obligations are included in aggregate in the table below 
future minimum payments under operating and capital leases  operating sublease income  and purchase obligations to vendors are as follows in thousands less than greater year years years than years total operating leases capital leases purchase obligations total operating sub lease income in connection with the acquisitions of mosaic and x net  we have committed to pay additional cash consideration if certain financial metrics are achieved during a certain time period 
for mosaic  the earn out could be up to million in for x net  the additional consideration could be million in and million in as of december   the certainty of these payments cannot be determined 
we believe that our expected cash flows from operations together with our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
if cash generated from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or issue debt securities or establish an additional credit facility 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
the addition of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could result in operating covenants that would restrict our operations 
we cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
the foreign currency financial statements of our international operations are translated into us dollars at current exchange rates  except revenues and expenses  which are translated at average exchange rates during each reporting period 
net exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities are accumulated in a separate section of stockholders equity titled accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
therefore  our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk occurs when translating the financial results of our international operations to us dollars in consolidation 
at this time  we do not use financial instruments to hedge our foreign exchange exposure because the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations are not material 
the net assets of our foreign operations at december  were approximately million 
our capital lease obligations include only fixed rates of interest 
therefore  we do not believe there is any material exposure to market risk changes in interest rates relating to our capital lease obligations
