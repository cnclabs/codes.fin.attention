item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our operations are grouped into three segments x software and related systems and services x data center service bureau services x application service provider services asp software and related systems and services is the design  installation  implementation and maintenance of computer information systems that provide comprehensive healthcare information technology solutions  including billing  patient tracking and scheduling for inpatient and outpatient environments  as well as clinical documentation and medical record generation and management 
data center services involves our personnel performing data entry and data processing services for customers 
application service provider services involves us offering our avatar suite of products  our carenet products and infoscriber products on a virtual private network or through an internet delivery approach  thereby allowing our customers to deploy products and pay on a monthly service basis  thus eliminating capital intensive system requirements 
prior to the acquisition of carenet  our asp operations were immaterial and were included in software and related systems and services 
years ended december  and results of operations fixed price software development contracts  third party hardware and software components and licenses accounted for and of consolidated revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease is the result of more labor revenue being generated on an as incurred basis  as well as a change in the overall mix of our revenue components 
our recurring revenue components  which include our maintenance contract services and our data center and asp services  accounted for of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december  compared to of consolidated revenue for the year ended december  we recognize revenue for fixed price contracts on the estimated percentage of completion basis 
since the billing schedules under the contracts differ from the recognition of revenue  at the end of any period  these contracts generally result in either costs and estimated profits in excess of billing or billing in excess of costs and estimated profits 
revenue from fixed price software development contracts is determined using the percentage of completion method which is based upon the time spent by our technical personnel on a project 
our total revenue for was  an increase of  or  from our revenue for  which was  revenue from contracts with state and local government agencies represented of revenue in and of revenue in this decrease is the result of the substantial completion towards the end of of one state contract and two county contracts

turnkey systems labor revenue refers to labor associated with turnkey installations and includes categories such as training  installation  project management and development 
revenue from third party hardware and software decreased to  in  from  in  which represents a decrease of 
sales of third party hardware and software  such as pharmacy and database software  are made in connection with the sales of turnkey systems 
these sales are typically made at lower gross margins than our human services revenue

this increase is the result of the introduction of our new avatar addictions management product into the market place during the latter part of small turnkey division sales relate to turnkey contracts that are less than  and are usually completed within one month 
gross profit decreased to  in from  in  reflecting a decrease of 
our gross margin percentage was in compared to in our gross margin decreased as a result of the decrease in license revenue 
this decrease was partially offset by improved labor efficiency on our fixed price contracts 
data center services service bureau data center clients typically generate approximately the same amount of revenue each year 
we bill on a transaction basis or on a fixed fee arrangement 
historically  each year we increase the transaction or fixed fees by an amount that approximates the new york urban consumer price index increase 
the data center revenue increased to  in from  in  representing an increase of  or

the remaining decrease in working capital of  was due to changes in other current assets and liabilities 
in june  we entered into a term loan agreement with fleet bank  which was subsequently acquired by the bank of america b of a 
this financing provides us with a five year term loan of million 
the current term loan bears interest at libor plus 
we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement with b of a for the amount outstanding under the term loan whereby we converted our variable rate on the term loan to a fixed rate of in order to reduce the interest rate risk associated with these borrowings

a part of our growth strategy is to acquire other businesses that are related to our current business 
such acquisitions may be made with cash  our securities  or a combination of cash and securities

as of the date of this form k annual report  we did not have any formal or informal agreements or understandings with respect to any material acquisitions  and we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to complete any material acquisitions 
based on our outstanding contracts and our continuing business  we believe that our cash flow from operations and our cash on hand will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
it is possible that we may need additional funding if we go forward with certain acquisitions or if our business does not develop as we anticipate or if our expenses  including our software development costs relating to our expansion of our product line and our marketing costs for seeking to expand the market for our products and services to include smaller clinics and facilities and sole group practitioners  exceed our expectation

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
among other things  estimates are used in accounting for allowances for bad debts  deferred income taxes  expected realizable values of assets primarily capitalized software development costs and customer lists and revenue recognition 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition capitalized software development costs impairment of customer lists revenue recognition revenue associated with fixed price turnkey sales consists of the following components licensing of software  labor associated with the installation and implementation of the software  and maintenance services rendered in connection with such licensing activities 
revenue from fixed price software development contracts and revenue under license agreements  which require significant modification of the software package to the customer s specifications  are recognized utilizing the estimated percentage of completion method which uses the units of work performed method to measure progress towards completion 
revisions in cost estimates and recognition of losses on these contracts are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts become known 
the complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes 
maintenance contract revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the respective contract 
we also derive revenue from the sale of third party hardware and software which is recognized based upon the terms of each contract 
consulting revenue is recognized when the services are rendered 
data center revenue and application service provider revenue are recognized in the period in which the services are provided 
the above sources of revenue are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
contract terms often provide for billing schedules that differ from revenue recognition and give rise to costs and estimated profits in excess of billings  and billings in excess of costs and estimated profits 
deferred revenue represents revenue billed and collected but not yet earned 
the cost of maintenance revenue  which consists solely of staff payroll and applicable overhead  is expensed as incurred 
capitalized software development costs capitalization of computer software development costs begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility and ends upon its availability for general release to customers 
technological feasibility for our computer software products is generally based upon achievement of a detail program design free of high risk development issues 
we capitalize only those costs directly attributable to the development of the software 
the establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment of recoverability of capitalized computer software development costs require considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors  including  but not limited to  technological feasibility  anticipated future gross revenue  estimated economic life and changes in software and hardware technology 
prior to reaching technological feasibility these costs are expensed as incurred and included in research  development and maintenance 
activities undertaken after the products are available for general release to customers to correct errors or keep the product updated are expensed as incurred and included in research  development and maintenance 
amortization of capitalized computer software development costs commences when the related products become available for general release to customers 
amortization is provided on a product by product basis 
the annual amortization is the greater of the amount computed using a the ratio that current gross revenue for a product bears to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenue for that product or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
the estimated life of these products range from to years 
we periodically perform reviews of the recoverability of such capitalized software costs 
at the time a determination is made that capitalized amounts are not recoverable based on the estimated cash flows to be generated from the applicable software  any remaining capitalized amounts are written off 
impairment of customer lists pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate our long lived assets for financial impairment  and continue to evaluate them as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them 
at the time such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of certain long lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of such assets  the assets are adjusted to their fair values 
risk factors the results of the company s operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
see risk factors  above 
forward looking statements statements in this form k annual report may be forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements that express our intentions  beliefs  expectations  strategies  predictions or any other statements relating to our future activities or other future events or conditions 
these statements are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about our business based  in part  on assumptions made by management 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in the forward looking statements due to numerous factors  including those described above and those risks discussed from time to time in this form k annual report for the year ended december   including the risks described under risk factors and in other documents which we file with the securities and exchange commission 
in addition  such statements could be affected by risks and uncertainties related to product demand  market and customer acceptance  competition  government regulations and requirements  pricing and development difficulties  as well as general industry and market conditions and growth rates  and general economic conditions 
any forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made  and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
most of our debt is at fixed rates of interest after completing an interest rate swap agreement  which effectively converted our variable rate debt into a fixed rate debt of 
therefore  if the libor rate plus increases above  it may have a positive effect on our comprehensive income 
most of our invested cash and cash equivalents  which are invested in money market accounts and commercial paper  are at variable rates of interest 
if market interest rates decrease by percent from levels at december   the effect on our net income would be a decrease of approximately  per year
