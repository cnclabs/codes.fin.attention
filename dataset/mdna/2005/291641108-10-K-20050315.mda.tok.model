we currently supplement our on system generating capacity with purchases of capacity and energy from other utilities in order to meet the demands of our customers and the capacity margins applicable to us under current pooling agreements and national electric reliability council rules 
the spp requires its members to maintain a minimum capacity margin 
we have contracted with westar energy for the purchase of capacity and energy through may  we had short term contracts for the purchase of firm energy with american electric power aep from january through june the amount of capacity purchased under such contracts supplements our on system capacity and contributes to meeting our current expectations of future power needs 
to the extent we do not need such capacity to meet our customers needs  we can sell it in the wholesale market 
on december   we entered into a year contract with ppm energy  to purchase the energy generated at the proposed elk river windfarm which will be located in butler county  kansas 
we anticipate purchasing approximately  megawatt hours of energy annually from the project beginning in december on january   flint hills tallgrass prairie heritage foundation  inc filed a purported class action complaint in the united states district court the court seeking to halt the development or operation of industrial wind turbine electric power generation facilities within the flint hills tallgrass prairie ecosystem 
this complaint was dismissed with prejudice by the court on february  a notice of appeal has been filed 
see item  legal proceedings 
on february   we filed an application with the missouri public service commission to initiate a process to obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity to participate in a proposed steam electric generating station in platte county  missouri iatan unit  and in connection therewith  obtain approval of an experimental regulatory plan that will provide adequate assurance to potential investors concerning this  or other baseload generation options 
we are considering owning up to mws of the mw iatan unit  although we are not committed to own any of the unit at this time and have not received any proposed contractual documents from kcp l 
our forecasted customer growth indicates we will be below the spp s minimum capacity requirement beginning in as a result  we have purchased  and will install at our riverton facility  a siemens va combustion turbine with an expected summer capacity of megawatts to be operational in the following chart sets forth our purchase commitments and our anticipated owned capacity in megawatts during the indicated contract years which run from june to may of the following year 
the capacity ratings we use for our generating units are based on summer rating conditions as utilized by spp guidelines 
the megawatts from the new combustion turbine are included under anticipated owned capacity beginning in the purchased power to be received from the new windfarm and the proposed iatan unit project  however  are not included in this chart 
because the wind power is an intermittent  non firm resource  we do not expect the spp to allow us to count a substantial amount of the wind power as capacity 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
contract year purchased power commitment anticipated owned capacity total the charges for capacity purchases under the westar contract referred to above during calendar year amounted to approximately million 
minimum charges for capacity purchases under the westar contract total approximately million for the period june   through may  the maximum hourly demand on our system reached a record high of  megawatts on august  our previous record peak of  megawatts was established in august the maximum hourly winter demand of megawatts was set on january  our previous winter peak of megawatts was established on december  our peak was  megawatts established on august  construction program total gross property additions including construction work in progress for the three years ended december   amounted to million and retirements during the same period amounted to million 
please refer to item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for more information 
our total capital expenditures  including allowance for funds used during construction afudc  but excluding capitalized software costs and expenditures to retire assets  were million in and for the next three years are estimated for planning purposes to be as follows estimated capital expenditures amounts in millions total new generating facilities additions to existing generating facilities transmission facilities distribution system additions non regulated additions general and other additions total additions to our transmission and distribution systems to meet projected increases in customer demand and construction expenditures for new generating facilities constitute the majority of the projected capital expenditures for the three year period listed above  including approximately million in  million in and million in for the purchase and installation at our riverton facility of the planned siemens va combustion turbine with an expected capacity of megawatts 
our estimated capital expenditures for and have increased over previously estimated amounts due to the reallocation of million of new generation expenditures that had been anticipated to be spent in but were not 
estimated capital expenditures are reviewed and adjusted for  among other things  revised estimates of future capacity needs  the cost of funds necessary for construction and the availability and cost of alternative power 
actual capital expenditures may vary significantly from the estimates due to a number of factors including changes in equipment delivery schedules  changes in customer requirements  construction delays  ability to raise capital  environmental matters  the extent to which we receive timely and adequate rate increases  the extent of competition from independent power producers and co generators  other changes in business conditions and changes in legislation and regulation  including those relating to the energy industry 
see regulation below and item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations competition 
fuel coal supplied approximately of our total fuel requirements in based on kilowatt hours generated 
the remainder was supplied by natural gas with oil and tire derived fuel tdf  which is produced from discarded passenger car tires  providing the remaining 
we expect that the amount and percentage of electricity generated by natural gas will decrease in and in the immediate future thereafter due to the year contract we entered into with ppm energy to purchase the energy generated by the elk river windfarm 
we anticipate purchasing approximately  megawatt hours of energy  or of our annual needs  from the project beginning in december we anticipate the cost of this contract to also be offset by purchasing less higher priced power from other suppliers or by displacing on system generation 
our asbury plant is fueled primarily by coal with oil being used as start up fuel and tdf being used as a supplement fuel 
in  asbury burned a coal blend consisting of approximately western coal powder river basin and blend coal on a tonnage basis 
our average coal inventory target at asbury is approximately days 
as of december   we had sufficient coal on hand to supply anticipated requirements at asbury for days 
this extra inventory was due to coal purchased over and above our contractual obligations in order to take advantage of favorable market conditions and for test burns conducted during our riverton plant fuel requirements are primarily met by coal with the remainder supplied by natural gas and oil 
during riverton burned western coal powder river basin on unit no 
and a blend consisting of approximately western coal powder river basin and blend coal on unit no 
on a tonnage basis 
our average coal inventory target at riverton is approximately days 
as of december   we had coal supplies on hand to meet anticipated requirements at the riverton plant for days 
our long term contract with peabody holding company  inc for low sulfur western coal powder river basin for the asbury and riverton plants expired in december we signed a new  three year contract with peabody on december  that covers approximately of our anticipated western coal requirements  approximately of our anticipated western coal requirements and approximately of our anticipated western coal requirements 
this peabody coal is supplied from the rochelle north antelope mines located in campbell county  wyoming  and is shipped to the asbury plant by rail  a distance of approximately miles 
the coal is delivered under a transportation contract with union pacific railroad company and the kansas city southern railway company which expires at the end of june in we accepted a binding proposal and are in the process of finalizing contractual terms and conditions on a new transportation contract 
we expect that  beginning in july  this coal will be delivered under the new transportation contract 
the delivered price of coal is expected to be higher than the price during the first and second quarters of  but we expect the delivered price increase to be substantially mitigated beginning in the third quarter of due to a combination of our new coal supply and coal transportation contracts 
we are currently leasing one car aluminum unit train  which delivers peabody coal to the asbury plant 
the peabody coal is transported from asbury to riverton via truck 
we have a long term contract expiring december  with phoenix coal sales  inc for a supply of blend coal 
we began receiving coal from phoenix s garland mine in june previously  the riverton plant blend coal was supplied under the same contract out of phoenix s bunker hill mine 
the phoenix coal is transported to riverton and asbury via truck 
unit no 
at the iatan plant is a coal fired generating unit which is jointly owned by kansas city power light kcp l  aquila and us 
kcp l is the operator of this plant and is responsible for arranging its fuel supply 
kcp l has secured contracts for low sulfur western coal in quantities sufficient to meet substantially all of iatan s requirements for  approximately for  approximately for and approximately for the coal is transported by rail under a contract expiring on december   with the burlington northern and santa fe railway company 
our energy center and state line combustion turbine facilities are fueled primarily by natural gas with oil being used as a backup fuel 
in april  two megawatt ft peaking units were placed into commercial operation at the energy center 
during  fuel consumption at the energy center was natural gas with the remaining being oil based on kilowatt hours generated 
state line fuel consumption during was natural gas 
our targeted oil inventory at the energy center facility permits eight days of full load operation on units no 
and as of december   we have oil inventories sufficient for approximately five and one half days of full load operation for these two units at the energy center and five days of full load operation for state line unit no 
the two new peaking units at the energy center are currently designed with a day tank for fuel oil storage  which allows both units to operate at full load for approximately one day 
we have firm transportation agreements with southern star central pipeline  inc with original expiration dates of july   for the transportation of natural gas to the state line power plant for the jointly owned combined cycle unit 
this date is adjusted for periods of contract suspension by us during outages of the slcc 
this transportation agreement can also supply natural gas to state line unit no 
 the energy center or the riverton plant  as elected by us on a secondary basis 
our transportation agreement was originally with williams natural gas company williams 
in  we signed a precedent agreement with williams now southern star central  which upon completion of necessary upgrades to the natural gas pipeline system in september  will provide additional transportation capability for years 
this contract provides firm transport to the sites listed above that previously were only served on a secondary basis 
we expect that these transportation agreements will serve nearly all of our natural gas transportation needs over the next several years 
any remaining gas transportation requirements  although small  will be met by utilizing capacity release on other holder contracts  interruptible transport  or delivered to the plants by others 
the majority of our physical natural gas supply requirements will be met by short term forward contracts and spot market purchases 
forward natural gas commodity prices and volumes are hedged several years into the future in accordance with our risk management policy in an attempt to lessen the volatility in our fuel expense and gain predictability

air 
the amendments to the clean air act  referred to as the amendments  affect the asbury  riverton  state line and iatan power plants and units and the ft peaking units at the empire energy center 
the amendments require affected plants to meet certain emission standards  including maximum emission levels for sulfur dioxide so and nitrogen oxides nox 
when a plant becomes an affected unit for a particular emission  it locks in the then current emission standards 
the asbury plant became an affected unit under the amendments for so on january  and for nox as a group cyclone fired boiler on january  the iatan plant became an affected unit for both so and nox on january  the riverton plant became an affected unit for nox in november and for so on january  the state line plant became an affected unit for so and nox on january  units and at the empire energy center became affected units for both so and nox in april so emissions 
under the amendments  the amount of so an affected unit can emit is regulated 
each existing affected unit has been awarded a specific number of emission allowances  each of which allows the holder to emit one ton of so utilities covered by the amendments must have emission allowances equal to the number of tons of so emitted during a given year by each of their affected units 
allowances may be traded between plants or utilities or banked for future use 
a market for the trading of emission allowances exists on the chicago board of trade 
the environmental protection agency epa withholds annually a percentage of the emission allowances awarded to each affected unit and sells those emission allowances through a direct auction 
we receive compensation from the epa for the sale of these withheld allowances 
in  our asbury  riverton and iatan plants burned a blend of low sulfur western coal powder river basin and higher sulfur local coal or burned low sulfur western coal 
in addition  tire derived fuel tdf was used as a supplemental fuel at the asbury plant 
the riverton plant can also burn natural gas as its primary fuel 
the state line plant and the energy center units and are gas fired facilities and do not receive so allowances 
annual allowance requirements for the state line plant and the energy center units and  which are not expected to exceed allowances per year  will be transferred from our inventoried bank of allowances 
based on current operations  the combined actual so allowance need for all affected plant facilities is approximately equal to the number of allowances awarded to us annually by the epa 
as of december   we have  banked allowances 
on july   we filed an application with the missouri public service commission seeking an order authorizing us to implement a plan for the management  sale  exchange  transfer or other disposition of our so emission allowances issued by the epa 
subsequently  we  the missouri public service commission staff staff and the office of public counsel opc engaged in discussions to determine an agreeable manner for us to implement an so allowance management policy samp 
as a result of these discussions  the parties entered into a unanimous stipulation and agreement on january   stating that we should be granted authority by the commission to manage our so allowance inventory in accordance with the terms in our samp document  which would provide us the authority to swap banked allowances for future vintage allowances and or monetary value and  in extreme market conditions  provides us with the authority to sell so allowances outright for monetary value 
on march   the missouri public service commission approved the stipulation and agreement to become effective march  nox emissions 
the asbury  iatan  state line  energy center and riverton plants are each in compliance with the nox limits applicable to them under the amendments as currently operated 
the asbury plant received permission from the missouri department of natural resources mdnr to burn tdf at a maximum rate of of total fuel input 
during  approximately  tons of tdf were burned 
this is equivalent to  discarded passenger car tires 
in april the mdnr promulgated a final rule addressing the ozone moderate non attainment classification of the st 
louis area 
the final regulation  known as the missouri nox rule  set a maximum nox emission rate of lbs mmbtu for eastern missouri and a maximum nox emission rate of lbs mmbtu for western missouri 
the iatan  asbury  state line and energy center facilities are affected by the western missouri regulation 
in april the mdnr approved amendments to the missouri nox rule 
included were amendments to delay the effective date of the rule until may  and to establish a nox emission limit of lbs mmbtu for plants burning tire derived fuel with a minimum annual burn of  passenger tire equivalents 
the asbury plant qualified for the lbs mmbtu emission rate 
all of our plants currently meet the required emission limits and additional nox controls are not required 
water 
we operate under the kansas and missouri water pollution plans that were implemented in response to the federal water pollution control act amendments of the asbury  iatan  riverton  energy center and state line facilities are in compliance with applicable regulations and have received discharge permits and subsequent renewals as required 
the energy center permit was revised in the riverton plant is affected by final regulations for cooling water intake structures issued under the cwa b phase ii 
the regulations became final on february  and require the submission of a comprehensive demonstration study with the permit renewal in the costs associated with compliance with these regulations are not expected to be material 
other 
under title v of the amendments  we must obtain site operating permits for each of our plants from the authorities in the state in which the plant is located 
these permits  which are valid for five years  regulate the plant site s total emissions  including emissions from stacks  individual pieces of equipment  road dust  coal dust and other emissions 
we have been issued permits for asbury  iatan  riverton  state line and the energy center power plants 
we submitted the required renewal application for the asbury title v permit in and will operate under the existing permit until the mdnr issues the renewed permit 
a compliance assurance monitoring cam plan is expected to be required by the renewed permit 
we estimate that the capital costs associated with the cam plan will not exceed million 
in mid december  the epa issued proposed regulations with respect to so  nox and mercury emissions from coal fired power plants in a proposed rulemaking known as the clean air interstate rule cair 
the final cair was issued by the epa on march  and will affect states  including missouri  where our asbury plant is located  but excluding kansas  where our riverton plant is located 
also in mid december  the epa issued proposed regulations for mercury emissions by power plants under the requirements of the amendments 
these proposed regulations are currently expected to be finalized in march it is possible that we may need to make some expenditures as early as in order to meet a proposed december  requirement for anticipated mercury reduction requirements under the proposed clean air mercury regulations 
the cair was issued  and the clean air mercury regulations are expected to be issued  as a result of delays and setbacks in the legislative process for the president s clear skies act legislation  which would have imposed different restrictions on so  nox and mercury emissions 
the cair is not directed to specific generation units  but instead  requires the state of missouri to develop a state implementation plan sip within the next months in order to comply with specific nox and so state wide annual budgets 
until that plan is finalized  we cannot determine the required emission rate of nox and so for the asbury or iatan plants 
also  the sip will likely include an allowance trading program for nox and so that could provide compliance without additional capital expenditures 
until the proposed mercury regulations are finalized and additional testing for mercury emissions is completed at iatan  asbury and riverton  we cannot determine if additional investments are required 
it is possible that compliance with the proposed mercury regulations will not require additional capital expenditures 
however  we expect that pollution control equipment required at the iatan plant by may include a selective catalytic reduction scr system and a flue gas desulphurization fgd system and a bag house  with our share of the capital cost estimated at million 
we expect that pollution control equipment needed at the asbury plant by may include a scr  a fgd and a bag house at an estimated capital cost of million 
conditions respecting financing our indenture of mortgage and deed of trust  dated as of september   as amended and supplemented the mortgage  and our restated articles of incorporation restated articles  specify earnings coverage and other conditions which must be complied with in connection with the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds or cumulative preferred stock  or the incurrence of unsecured indebtedness 
the mortgage contains a requirement that for new first mortgage bonds to be issued  our net earnings as defined in the mortgage for any twelve consecutive months within the months preceding issuance must be two times the annual interest requirements as defined in the mortgage on all first mortgage bonds then outstanding and on the prospective issue of new first mortgage bonds 
our earnings for the twelve months ended december   would permit us to issue approximately million of new first mortgage bonds based on this test at an assumed interest rate of 
in addition to the interest coverage requirement  the mortgage provides that new bonds must be issued against  among other things  retired bonds or of net property additions 
at december   we had retired bonds and net property additions which would enable the issuance of at least million principal amount of bonds if the annual interest requirements are met 
as of december   we are in compliance with all restrictive covenants of the mortgage 
under our restated articles  a cumulative preferred stock may be issued only if our net income available for interest and dividends as defined in our restated articles for a specified twelve month period is at least times the sum of the annual interest requirements on all indebtedness and the annual dividend requirements on all cumulative preferred stock to be outstanding immediately after the issuance of such additional shares of cumulative preferred stock  and b so long as any preferred stock is outstanding  the amount of unsecured indebtedness outstanding may not exceed of the sum of the outstanding secured indebtedness plus our capital and surplus 
we have no outstanding preferred stock 
accordingly  the restriction in our restated articles does not currently restrict the amount of unsecured indebtedness that we may have outstanding

see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the empire district electric company is an operating public utility engaged in the generation  purchase  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity in parts of missouri  kansas  oklahoma and arkansas 
we also provide water service to three towns in missouri and have investments in some non regulated businesses including fiber optics  internet access  close tolerance custom manufacturing and customer information system software services through our wholly owned subsidiary  ede holdings  inc in  of our gross operating revenues were provided from the sale of electricity  from the sale of water and from our non regulated businesses 
the primary drivers of our electric operating revenues in any period are weather  rates we can charge our customers  customer growth  the ability or inability due to the lack of a fuel adjustment provision in missouri to recover increases in fuel costs in rates and general economic conditions 
weather affects the demand for electricity for our regulated business 
very hot summers and very cold winters increase demand  while mild weather reduces demand 
residential and commercial sales are impacted more by weather than industrial sales  which are mostly affected by business needs for electricity and general economic conditions 
the utility commissions in the states in which we operate  as well as the ferc  set the rates at which we can charge our customers 
in order to offset expenses  we depend on our ability to receive adequate and timely rate relief 
we continue to assess the need for rate relief in all of the jurisdictions we serve and file for such relief when necessary 
customer growth  which is the growth in the number of customers  contributes to the demand for electricity 
we expect our annual customer growth to be approximately over the next several years 
we define sales growth to be growth in kwh sales excluding the impact of weather 
the primary drivers of sales growth are customer growth and general economic conditions 
the primary drivers of our electric operating expenses in any period are fuel and purchased power expense  maintenance and repairs expense  employee pension and health care costs  taxes and non cash items such as depreciation and amortization expense 
fuel and purchased power costs are our largest expense items 
several factors affect these costs  including fuel and purchased power prices  plant outages and weather  which drives customer demand 
in order to control the price we pay for fuel and purchased power  we have entered into long and short term agreements to purchase coal and natural gas for our energy supply and currently engage in hedging activities in an effort to minimize our risk from volatile natural gas prices 
we enter into contracts with counterparties relating to our future natural gas requirements that lock in prices with respect to predetermined percentages of our expected future natural gas needs in an attempt to lessen the volatility in our fuel expense and improve predictability 
we have purchased  and will install at our riverton facility  a siemens va combustion turbine with a summer rated capacity of megawatts to be operational in to meet additional capacity requirements due to anticipated customer growth 
on december   we entered into a year contract with ppm energy  to purchase the energy generated at the proposed elk river windfarm which will be located in butler county  kansas 
we expect that the amount and percentage of electricity we generate by natural gas will decrease in and in the immediate future thereafter due to this contract 
we anticipate purchasing approximately  megawatt hours of energy  or of our annual needs  from the project beginning in december we anticipate the cost of this contract to also be offset by purchasing less higher priced power from other suppliers or by displacing on system generation 
we believe this project is a significant step in assuring that our shareholders and customers benefit from a balanced mix of generation options 
with the improvements made in wind generation technology and the extension of the production tax credits  wind energy provides price stability  is environmentally friendly and is economical for our customers 
for the twelve months ended december   basic and diluted earnings per weighted average share of common stock were as compared to for the twelve months ended december  the following reconciliation of earnings per share between and is a non gaap presentation 
we believe this information is useful in understanding the fluctuation in earnings per share between the prior and current year 
the reconciliation presents the after tax impact of significant items and components of the statement of operations on a per share basis before the impact of additional stock issuances which is presented separately 
earnings per share for the years ended december  and shown in the reconciliation are presented on a gaap basis and are the same as the amounts included in the statements of income 
this reconciliation may not be comparable to other companies or more useful than the gaap presentation included in the statements of operations 
earnings per share revenues on system electric off system electric non regulated water expenses fuel purchased power regulated other excluding employee health care expense regulated other employee health care expense only non regulated expenses maintenance and repairs depreciation and amortization other taxes interest charges other income and deductions dilutive effect of additional shares earnings per share fourth quarter results revenues for the fourth quarter of were million compared to million in the fourth quarter of the increase in revenues was primarily driven by customer growth 
earnings for the fourth quarter of were million  or per share  compared to fourth quarter earnings of million  or per share 
while an increase in revenues for the fourth quarter of contributed an estimated per share in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of  due to customer growth  increases in total fuel and purchased power costs reduced earnings per share by an estimated per share 
also negatively impacting earnings were increases in health care expense  depreciation  property taxes and losses from our non regulated business units 
results of operations the following discussion analyzes significant changes in the results of operations for  compared to  and for  compared to electric operating revenues and kilowatt hour sales electric operating revenues comprised approximately of our total operating revenues during of these total electric operating revenues  approximately were from residential customers  from commercial customers  from industrial customers  from wholesale on system customers  from wholesale off system transactions and from miscellaneous sources  primarily transmission services 
the breakdown of our customer classes has not significantly changed from or the amounts and percentage changes from the prior periods in kilowatt hour kwh sales and operating revenues by major customer class for on system electric sales were as follows kwh sales in millions change change residential commercial industrial wholesale on system other total on system operating revenues in millions change change residential commercial industrial wholesale on system other total on system percentage changes are based on actual kwhs and revenues and may not agree to the rounded amounts shown in this table 
revenues exclude amounts collected under the interim energy charge during and refunded to customers during the first quarter of see discussion below 
other kwh sales and other operating revenues include street lighting  other public authorities and interdepartmental usage 
on system electric transactions kwh sales for our on system customers increased slightly during primarily due to continued sales growth 
revenues for our on system customers increased approximately million  with an estimated million of this increase attributed to the oklahoma and ferc rate increases discussed below 
continued sales growth contributed an estimated million to revenues during  offset by an estimated million negative effect from weather 
our customer growth was in and in both and we expect our annual customer growth to be approximately over the next several years 
residential kwh sales and revenues  which are more weather sensitive than the other sales classes  decreased in due primarily to milder temperatures  which had a negative effect on sales  during the first  third and fourth quarters of as compared to the same periods in commercial sales and revenues and industrial sales and revenues  which are not particularly weather sensitive  increased during primarily due to the continued sales growth discussed above 
industrial sales also benefited from the addition of two new oil pipeline pumping stations on our system that became fully operational in june in addition  industrial revenues  as well as residential and commercial revenues  were favorably impacted by the august oklahoma rate increase 
on system wholesale kwh sales decreased slightly while revenues associated with these ferc regulated sales increased as a result of the ferc rate increase that became effective may  and as a result of the fuel adjustment clause applicable to such sales 
this clause permits the distribution to customers of changes in fuel and purchased power costs 
the decrease in kwh sales was mainly due to the change in customer status in june of an on system wholesale customer aggregator  comprising three of our on system wholesale accounts  which elected to go off system and purchase power from us at market based rates 
revenues received from these accounts  which comprised of our on system wholesale sales and revenues  but less than one half percent of our total on system sales and revenues in  are now included in our off system revenues 
kwh sales for our on system customers increased slightly during as compared to  primarily due to continued sales growth 
colder temperatures during the first quarter of as compared to milder temperatures during the same period in had a positive effect on sales with a new all time winter peak of megawatts being established on january   replacing the previous winter peak of megawatts established in december however  the increase in first quarter sales was offset by unfavorable weather in the second  third and fourth quarters of notwithstanding setting a new summer peak demand of  megawatts on august  despite only a slight increase in kwh sales  revenues from our on system customers increased approximately million  with an estimated million of this increase attributed to the missouri  oklahoma and ferc rate increases discussed below with the remainder attributed to continued sales growth 
this continued sales growth contributed an estimated million to revenues during offset by an estimated million negative effect from weather 
notwithstanding the new summer peak demand  the slight increases in residential and commercial kwh sales in were due primarily to the continued sales growth discussed above 
industrial sales and revenues  which are not particularly weather sensitive  increased during mainly due to increased sales resulting from the addition of the two new oil pipeline pumping stations on our system in june also contributing to the increase were increased sales during the first quarter of because of better economic conditions as compared to the first quarter of when our service territory experienced a general slowdown in economic activity 
in addition  industrial revenues  as well as residential and commercial revenues  were favorably impacted by the december missouri rate increase and  to a lesser extent  the august oklahoma rate increase 
on system wholesale kwh sales decreased due mainly to the change in customer status in june of the on system wholesale customer aggregator which elected to go off system and purchase power from us at market based rates 
overall revenues associated with these ferc regulated sales increased as a result of the ferc rate increase that became effective may  and as a result of the fuel adjustment clause applicable to such sales 
rate matters the following table sets forth information regarding electric and water rate increases granted during the four year period ended december  affecting the revenue comparisons discussed above jurisdiction date requested annual increase granted percent increase granted date effective missouri electric november  october  missouri electric march  december  missouri electric april  march  missouri water may  december  kansas electric december  july  ferc electric march  may  oklahoma electric march  august  the missouri order approved an annual interim energy charge  or iec  of approximately million effective october  and expiring two years later which was collected subject to refund with interest 
the missouri electric order called for us to refund all funds collected under the iec  with interest  by march  the refunds were made in the first quarter of and did not have a material impact on our earnings in any of the years from through on march   we filed a request with the oklahoma corporation commission for an annual increase in base rates for our oklahoma electric customers in the amount of  or 
on august  a unanimous stipulation and agreement was approved by the oklahoma corporation commission providing an annual increase in rates for our oklahoma customers of approximately  or  effective for bills rendered on or after august  this reflects a rate of return on equity roe of on march   we filed a request with the ferc for an annual increase in base rates for our on system wholesale electric customers in the amount of  or 
this increase was approved by the ferc on april  with the new rates becoming effective may  on april   we filed a request with the missouri public service commission mpsc for an annual increase in base rates for our missouri electric customers in the amount of  or 
as part of the filing  we asked the commission to consider  in addition to a traditional ratemaking approach  two options that would allow us to recover our actual fuel and purchased power expenses an iec  subject to refund  similar to the one approved in our case  or a fuel adjustment clause  that would reflect actual fuel prices 
we subsequently abandoned our request for a fuel adjustment clause due to missouri statutes not providing for such clauses but retained our request for the iec  subject to refund 
we also asked for a roe of and an annual increase in missouri depreciation expense of approximately million 
on may   we filed a request with the mpsc to implement the proposed iec no later than june  however  the mpsc denied this request on august  on september   the staff of the mpsc filed direct testimony in response to our initial april filing recommending an iec be adopted for a period of months  due to the extreme volatility currently exhibited by natural gas prices 
we completed two weeks of evidentiary hearings during december items that were covered during the hearings were roe  depreciation  base fuel and purchased power costs and the term and amount of an iec 
on february   we  the office of public counsel opc and two intervenors filed a nonunanimous stipulation and agreement regarding fuel and purchased power expense establishing a three year refundable iec which became unanimous by operation of commission rule on march  prior to the hearings  we were able to settle several miscellaneous issues with other parties to the case 
on december   we  the mpsc staff  the opc and two intervenors filed a unanimous stipulation and agreement as to certain issues with the mpsc settling several of these issues 
one of the issues we were able to agree on was a change in the recognition of pension costs
