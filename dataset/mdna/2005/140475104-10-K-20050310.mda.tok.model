critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience  observance of industry trends and various other sources of information and factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions

patient service revenue for medicaid patients is recorded at the reimbursement rates as the rates are set prospectively by the state upon the filing of an annual cost report 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation 
the company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations

assets held for sale the company determines the fair value  net of costs of disposal  of an asset on the date the asset is categorized as held for sale  and the asset is recorded at the lower of its fair value  net of cost of disposal  or carrying value on that date 
the company periodically reevaluates assets held for sale to determine if the assets are still recorded at the lower of fair value  net of cost of disposal  or carrying value 
the company currently has four parcels of land held for sale  two of which are under contract and expected to be sold during fiscal the fair value of these properties is generally determined based on market rates  industry trends and recent comparable sales transactions 
the actual sales price of these assets could differ significantly from the company s estimates 
long lived assets property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated useful lives are to years for buildings and building improvements  to years for land improvements and to years for furniture  equipment and automobiles 
at each balance sheet date  the company reviews the carrying value of its property and equipment to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that they may be impaired or that the depreciation period may need to be changed 
the company considers external factors relating to each asset  including contract changes  local market developments  and other publicly available information 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair market value  generally based on discounted cash flows  of the long lived asset 
the company analyzed certain long lived assets with operating losses  under the undiscounted cash flow method  for impairment 
the company does not believe there are any indicators that would require and the cash flow analysis did not require an adjustment to the carrying value of the property and equipment or their remaining useful lives as of december  and new accounting standards on december   the financial accounting standards board issued fasb statement no 
 revised statement r  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement  accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r is effective for public entities in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  
table of contents statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company plans to adopt statement r using the modified retrospective method  restating only the prior interim periods of the current year 
as permitted by statement  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r r s fair value method will have a significant impact on the company s result of operations  although it will have no impact on the company s financial position 
the impact of the adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on the levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of the standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described below in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in the periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million  and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company currently has elected to follow the intrinsic value method in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations in accounting for its employee and director stock options 
in accordance with apb  since the exercise price of the company s employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  generally no compensation expense is recognized 
stock option grants to non employees are accounted for in accordance with the fair value method of fasb

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company s primary market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates on debt instruments 
as of december   the company had million in outstanding debt comprised of various fixed and variable rate debt instruments of million and million  respectively 
changes in interest rates would affect the fair market value of the company s fixed rate debt instruments but would not have an impact on the company s earnings or cash flows 
fluctuations in interest rates on the company s variable rate debt instruments  which are tied to either libor or the prime rate  would affect the company s earnings and cash flows but would not affect the fair market value of the variable rate debt 
each percentage point change in interest rates would increase the company s annual interest expense by approximately million based on the company s outstanding variable debt as of december  
table of contents the following table summarizes information on the company s debt instruments outstanding as of december  the table presents the principal due and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date for the company s various debt instruments by fiscal year 
weighted average variable interest rates are based on the company s floating rate as of december  principal amount and average interest rate by expected maturity date at december  in thousands fair thereafter total value long term debt fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate interest rate lock total debt the company used interest rate swap and treasury lock agreements for purposes other than trading 
on december   the company settled its interest rate swap agreements by paying its lender million and this settlement resulted in the company recognizing a gain of million in the income statement 
interest rate swap agreements were used to modify variable rate obligations to fixed rate obligations  thereby reducing the company s exposure to market rate fluctuations 
the interest rate swap agreements were designed as hedges  and the effectiveness is determined by matching the principal balance and terms with that specific obligation 
the interest rate swap agreements involved exchanging amounts based on variable interest rates for amounts based on fixed interest rates over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the notional amounts upon which the payments are made 
the net effect of these agreements on the company s operating results was that the interest expense on the portion of variable rate debt being hedged is generally recorded based on fixed interest rates 
these interest rate swap agreements were entered into with a major financial institution in order to minimize counterparty credit risk 
the differential paid or received as rates change was accounted for under the accrual method of accounting and the amount payable to or receivable from counterparties was included as an adjustment to accrued interest 
the interest rate swap agreements resulted in the company recognizing an additional million  million and million in interest expense during  and  respectively 
in addition the company  through its acquisition of the triad entities  is party to interest rate lock agreements  which was used to hedge the risk that the costs of future issuance of debt may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
under the treasury lock agreements  the company agrees to pay or receive an amount equal to the difference between the net present value of the cash flows for a notional principal amount of indebtedness based on the locked rate at the date when the agreement was established and the yield of a united states government year treasury note on the settlement date of january  the notional amounts of the agreements were not exchanged 
these treasury lock agreements were entered into with a major financial institution in order to minimize counterparty credit risk 
the locked rates range from to 
as a result of refinancing the underlying debt on december   the interest rate lock agreements no longer qualify as an interest rate hedge 
this status change resulted in the company recording a loss of million in the income statement 
the company now reflects the interest rate lock agreements at fair value in the company s balance sheet as a long term liability and related gains and losses are recognized in the income statement 
in addition  the company has the ability settle the treasury lock liability by converting the liability to a five year note at any time prior to the treasury lock settlement date of january  prior to refinancing the underlying debt  the treasury lock agreements were reflected at fair value in the company s balance sheet other long term liabilities and the related gains or losses on these agreements were deferred in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income
