quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures value line  inc s consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks 
value line s significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates and equity prices 
the following sections address the significant market risks associated with value line s business activities 
interest rate risk value line s management prefers to invest in highly liquid debt securities with extremely low credit risk 
value line s strategy is to acquire securities that are attractively priced in relation to the perceived credit risk 
management recognizes and accepts that losses may occur 
to limit the price fluctuation in these securities from interest rate changes  value line s management invests primarily in short term obligations maturing in to years 
the fair values of value line s fixed maturity investments will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments 
additionally  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  and other general market conditions 
the following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates on assets that are subject to interest rate risk 
it is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks 
the hypothetical changes in market interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios 
variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available 
for these reasons  actual results might differ from those reflected in the table

estimated fair value after hypothetical change in interest rates bp basis points fair bp bp bp bp fixed income securities value increase decrease increase decrease as of april  investments in securities with fixed maturities as of april  investments in securities with fixed maturities during the last quarter of fiscal year  the company sold virtually all of its long term holdings of fixed maturity investments and transferred the proceeds to cash in preparation for payment of a special per share dividend  declared on april  the sale greatly reduced the company s exposure to risks associated with interest rate changes 
management regularly monitors the maturity structure of the company s investments in fixed maturity us government debt obligations in order to maintain an acceptable price risk associated with changes in interest rates 
equity price risk the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices or management s estimates of fair value as of the balance sheet dates 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer  the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold 
value line invests a significant level of its assets in equity securities  primarily the value line family of equity mutual funds 
each mutual fund invests in a variety of equity positions of various companies thereby diversifying value line s risk 
the company s objectives include maintenance of a greater weighting in large and mid capitalization companies in its equity portfolio to moderate price risk 
value line has also utilized derivative financial instruments in the past to minimize market price risk  although no such derivative financial instruments were utilized during fiscal and the table below summarizes value line s equity price risks as of april  and and shows the effects of a hypothetical increase and a decrease in market prices as of those dates 
the selected hypothetical changes do not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios
