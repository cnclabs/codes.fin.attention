item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview prior to our merger with alliance as discussed below  our business consisted of four business segments magazine fulfillment  in store services  wood manufacturing and shared services 
our segment reporting is structured based on the reporting of senior management to our chief executive officer 
our magazine fulfillment group provides domestic and foreign titled magazines to specialty retailers  such as bookstores and music stores  and to mainstream retailers  such as supermarkets  discount stores  drug stores  convenience stores and newsstands 
this group also exports domestic titled magazines from more than publishers to foreign markets worldwide 
we provide fulfillment services to more than  retail stores   of which also benefit from our selection and logistical procurement services 
our in store services group assists retailers with the design and implementation of their front end area merchandise programs  which generally have a three year life cycle 
we also provide other value added services to retailers  publishers and other vendors 
these services include assisting retailers with the filing of claims for publisher incentive payments  which are based on display location or total retail sales  and providing publishers with access to real time sales information on more than  magazine titles  thereby enabling them to make more informed decisions regarding their product placement  cover treatments and distribution efforts 
our wood manufacturing group designs and manufactures wood display and store fixtures for leading specialty retailers 
our shared services group consists of overhead functions not allocated to the other groups 
these functions include corporate finance  human resource  management information systems and executive management that are not allocated to the three operating groups 
upon completion of the consolidation of our administrative operations  we restructured our accounts to separately identify corporate expenses that are not attributable to any of our three main operating groups 
prior to fiscal year  these expenses were included within our in store services group 
on february   we completed the merger with alliance entertainment corp  a logistics and supply chain management services company for the home entertainment product market pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreement and plan of merger agreement dated as of november  the merger agreement 
alliance historically operated two business segments the distribution and fulfillment services group dfsg and the digital medial infrastructure services group the dmisg 
prior to the merger  on december   alliance disposed of all of the operations conducted by the dmisg business lines through a spin off to its existing stockholders 
consequently  in connection with the merger  we acquired only the dfsg business and not the dmisg business 
the dmisg business represented approximately and of alliance s consolidated sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we consummated the merger with alliance to further our objective of creating the premier provider of information  supply chain management and logistics services to retailers and producers of home entertainment content products 
we believe that the merger provides significant market opportunities to take advantage of our strong retailer relationships and experience in marketing our products by expanding product offerings beyond our existing magazine fulfillment business to dvds  cds  video games and related home entertainment products and accessories 
in addition  we believe that our in store merchandising capabilities will be strengthened 
we also believe this transaction will position us as the distribution channel of choice for film studios  record labels  publishers and other producers of home entertainment content products 
we expect to benefit from substantial cost savings in the areas of procurement  marketing  information technology and administration and from other operational efficiencies  particularly in the distribution and fulfillment functions  where we plan to consolidate some distribution operations  reorganize others and leverage our best practices across all of our distribution operations 
as a result  we believe the merger will enhance our financial strength  increase our visibility in the investor community and strengthen our ability to pursue further strategic acquisitions 
the total purchase price of approximately million consisted of million in source interlink common stock  representing approximately million shares  million related to the exchange of approximately million shares of common stock on exercise of outstanding stock options  warrants and other rights to acquire alliance common stock and direct transaction costs of million 
the value of the common stock was determined based on the average market price of source interlink common stock over the day period prior to and after the announcement of the merger in november the value of the stock options was determined using the black scholes option valuation model 
discontinued operation in november  the company sold and disposed of its secondary wholesale distribution operation for million  in order to focus more fully on its domestic and export distribution 
all rights owned under the secondary wholesale distribution contracts were assigned  delivered  conveyed and transferred to the buyer  an unrelated third party 
all assets and liabilities relating to our secondary wholesale distribution operation were not assumed by the buyer 
we recognized a gain on sale of this business of million net of tax in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the following amounts related to our magazine fulfillment segment s discontinued operation secondary wholesale distribution business have been segregated from continuing operations and reflected as discontinued operations in each period s consolidated statement of income in thousands revenue    loss before income taxes  income tax benefit  loss from discontinued operation  net of tax  pre tax gain on sale of discontinued business  income tax expense gain on sale of business  net of tax discontinued operations  net of tax revenues the magazine fulfillment group derives revenues from selling and distributing magazines  including domestic and foreign titles  to specialty and mainstream retailers throughout the united states and canada  exporting domestic titles internationally to foreign wholesalers or through domestic brokers  providing return processing services for major specialty retail book chains  and serving as an outsourced fulfillment agent and backroom operator for publishers 
the in store services group derives revenues from designing  manufacturing and invoicing participants in front end merchandising programs  providing claim filing services related to rebates owed to retailers from publishers or their designated agents  storing  shipping  installing  and removing front end fixtures  and providing information and management services relating to magazine sales to retailers and publishers throughout the united states and canada 
the wood manufacturing group derives revenues from designing  manufacturing and installing custom wood fixtures primarily for retailers 
cost of revenues our cost of revenues for the magazine fulfillment group consists of the costs of magazines purchased for resale less all applicable publisher discounts and rebates 
our cost of revenues for the in store services and the wood manufacturing groups includes raw materials consumed in the production of display fixtures  primarily steel  wood and plastic components  production labor  and manufacturing overhead 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for each of the operating groups include non production labor  rent and office overhead  insurance  professional fees  and management information systems 
expenses associated with corporate finance  human resources  management information systems and executive offices are included within the shared services group and are not allocated to the other groups 
fulfillment freight fulfillment freight consists of our direct costs of distributing magazines by third party freight carriers  primarily federal express ground service 
freight rates are driven primarily by the weight of the copies being shipped and the distance between origination and destination 
fulfillment freight is not disclosed as a component of cost of revenues  and  as a result  gross profit and gross profit margins are not comparable to other companies that include shipping and handling costs in cost of revenues 
fulfillment freight has increased proportionately as the amount of product we distribute has increased 
we anticipate the continued growth in our magazine fulfillment group will result in an increase in fulfillment freight 
generally  as pounds shipped increase  the cost per pound charged by third party carriers decreases 
as a result  fulfillment freight as a percent of the magazine fulfillment group s gross revenues should decline slightly in the future

as a result of this new process  claims outstanding related to our advance pay program decreased compared to the prior fiscal year end  without a significant decrease in either the number or amount of claims filed 
our borrowing agreements limit the amount of our capital expenditures in any fiscal year 
financing cash flow outstanding balances on our credit facility fluctuate partially due to the timing of the retailer rebate claiming process and our advance pay program  the seasonality of our wire manufacturing business  and the payment cycle of the magazine distribution business 
because the magazine distribution business and advance pay program cash requirement peak at our fiscal quarter ends  the reported bank debt levels usually are the maximum level outstanding during the quarter 
payments under our advance pay program generally occur just prior to our fiscal quarter end 
the related claims are not generally collected by us until days after the advance is made 
as a result  our funding requirements peak at the time of the initial advances and decrease over the next days as the cash is collected on the related claims 
the wire manufacturing business is seasonal because most retailers prefer initiating new programs before the holiday shopping season begins  which concentrates revenues in the second and third quarter 
receivables from these fixture programs are generally collected from all participants within days 
we are usually required to tender payment on the costs of these programs raw material and labor within a shorter period 
as a result  our funding requirements peak in the second and third fiscal quarters when we manufacture the wire fixtures and decrease significantly in the fourth and first fiscal quarters as the related receivable are collected and significantly less manufacturing activity is occurring 
within our magazine distribution business  our significant customers pay weekly  and we pay our suppliers monthly 
as a result  funding requirements peak at the end of the month when supplier payments are made and decrease over the course of the next month as our receivables are collected

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of the board 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we record a reduction in revenue for estimated magazine sales returns and a reduction in cost of sales for estimated magazine purchase returns 
estimated sales returns are based on historical sales returns and daily point of sale data from significant customers 
the purchase return estimate is calculated from the sales return reserve based on historical gross profit 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future results  revenue and or cost of sales may be misstated 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide for potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on customer specific information and historical collection experience 
if market conditions decline  actual collection experience may not meet expectations and may result in increased bad debt expenses 
taxes on earnings the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may be required to increase or decrease valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expenses or benefits 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or a component of an operating segment that constitutes a business for which financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by management 
management has determined that the company s reporting units are the same as its operating segments for the purpose of allocating goodwill and the subsequent testing of goodwill for impairment 
goodwill relates primarily to the in store services segment  which consists of acquired rebate claim filing and wire manufacturing operations 
the annual impairment review was completed in the first fiscal quarter of  and and no impairment charge was necessary 
the company assesses goodwill for impairment at least annually in the absence of an indicator of possible impairment and immediately upon an indicator of possible impairment 
fair value of the operating unit is determined based on a combination of discounted cash flows and publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples of comparable businesses 
for goodwill valuation purposes only  the fair value of the operating segment is allocated to the assets and liabilities of the operating segment to arrive at an implied fair value of goodwill  based upon known facts and circumstances as if the acquisition occurred currently 
the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the goodwill would be recognized as an impairment loss 
impairment of long lived assets the company records impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rate variability 
our debt primarily relates to credit facilities with wells fargo foothill 
see liquidity and capital resources debt the revolving credit facility with wells fargo foothill had an outstanding principal balance of approximately million at january  interest on the outstanding balance is charged based on a variable interest rate related to the prime rate at january  plus a margin specified in the credit agreement based on an availability calculation at january  the amended credit facility provides for a million term note payable that bears interest at the prime rate plus at january  
the term note is payable over five years in installments of million over four quarters beginning january  then the quarterly installments increase to   and million  respectively  over the subsequent four years 
the original term note payable with wells fargo foothill was paid in full in march the note payable with hilco capital was repaid in full during the quarter ended october  as a result of the above  our primary market risks relate to fluctuations in interest rates 
we do not perform any interest rate hedging activities related to these two facilities 
in connection with the suntrust mortgage discussed above  alliance entered into interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage the interest rate risk exposures of its variable rate debt portfolio 
these instruments are not designated as hedges  and  accordingly  are recorded at fair value as an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets and interest income expense in the consolidated statements of income 
additionally  alliance has exposure to foreign currency fluctuation through export sales to international accounts 
a significant change in the relative strength of the dollar to foreign currencies could result in a negative impact on alliance s results of operations 
alliance does not conduct any hedging activities related to foreign currency 
we have exposure to foreign currency fluctuations through our operations in canada 
these operations accounted for approximately million  which represented of our revenues for the year ended january  we generally pay the operating expenses related to these revenues in the corresponding local currency 
we will be subject to any risk for exchange rate fluctuations between such local currency and the dollar 
additionally  we have exposure to foreign currency fluctuation through our exporting of foreign magazines and the purchased of foreign magazine for domestic distribution 
revenues derived from the export of foreign titles or sale to domestic brokers who facilitate the export totaled million for the fiscal year or of total revenues 
for the most part  our export revenues are denominated in dollars and the foreign wholesaler is subject to foreign currency risks 
we have the availability to control foreign currency risk via increasing or decreasing the local cover price paid in the foreign markets 
there is a risk that a substantial increase in local cover price due to a decline in the local currency relative to the dollar could decrease demand for these magazines at retail and negatively impact our results of operations 
domestic distribution gross of imported titles totaled approximately million of a total million or 
foreign publications are purchased in both dollars and the local currency of the foreign publisher  primarily euros and pound sterling 
in the instances where we buy in the foreign currency  we generally have the ability to set the domestic cover price  which allows us to control the foreign currency risk 
foreign titles generally have significantly higher cover prices then comparable domestic titles  are considered somewhat of a luxury item  are sold only at select retail locations  and sales do not appear to be highly impacted by cover price increases 
however  a significant negative change in the relative strength of the dollar to these foreign currencies could result in higher domestic cover prices and result in lower sales of these titles at retail  which would negatively impact our results of operations 
we do not conduct any significant hedging activities related to foreign currency
