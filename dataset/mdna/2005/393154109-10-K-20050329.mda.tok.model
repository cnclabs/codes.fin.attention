item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md and a 
executive overview green mountain power corporation the company generates virtually all of its earnings from retail electricity sales 
our retail electricity sales grow at an average annual rate of between one and two percent  about average for most electric utility companies in new england 
while wholesale revenues are substantial  they have relatively minor impact on our operating results and financial condition 
the company is regulated and cannot adjust prices of retail electricity sales without regulatory approval from the vermont public service board vpsb 
the company increased its dividend in february from an annual rate of per share to per share 
the company s dividend payout ratio remains comparatively low  at approximately percent of earnings from continuing operations 
we expect to grow our dividend payout ratio to the middle of a payout range of between and percent over the next five years  in line with other electric utilities having similar risk profiles  so long as financial and operating results permit 
fair regulatory treatment is fundamental to maintaining the company s financial stability 
rates must be set at levels to recover costs  including a market rate of return to equity and debt holders in order to attract capital 
in december  the company received approval from the vpsb of a new rate plan covering the period through  which sets rates at levels the company believes will provide an improved opportunity to recover costs  and to earn its allowed rate of return 
in accordance with the rate plan  the vpsb approved  and the company implemented  a percent rate increase  effective january  power supply expenses were equivalent to approximately percent of total revenues in the company s need to seek rate increases from its customers frequently moves in tandem with increases in our power supply costs 
we have entered into long term power supply contracts for most of our energy needs 
all of our power supply contract costs are currently included in the rates we charge our customers 
the risks associated with our power supply resources  including outage  curtailment  and other delivery risks  the timing of contract expirations  the volatility of wholesale prices  and other factors impacting our power supply resources and how they relate to customer demand are discussed below under item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk  and other risk factors 
we also discuss other risks  including customer concentration risk related to our largest customer  international business machines corporation ibm  and contingencies that could have a significant impact on future operating results and our financial condition 
growth opportunities beyond the company s normal investment in its infrastructure are also discussed  and include a planned increase in our equity investment in vermont electric power company  inc velco and a planned increase in sales of utility services 
in this section  we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for the company and its subsidiaries 
this explanation includes factors that affect our business  our earnings and costs in the periods presented and why they changed between periods  the source of our earnings  our expenditures for capital projects and what we expect they will be in the future  where we expect to get cash for future capital expenditures  and how all of the above affect our overall financial condition 
there are statements in this section that contain projections or estimates that are considered to be forward looking as defined by the securities and exchange commission the sec 
in these statements  you may find words such as believes  expects  plans  or similar words 
these statements are not guarantees of our future performance 
there are risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to be different from those projected 
some of the reasons the results may be different include regulatory and judicial decisions or legislation changes in regional market and transmission rules energy supply and demand and pricing contractual commitments availability  terms  and use of capital general economic and business environment changes in technology nuclear and environmental issues industry restructuring and cost recovery including stranded costs weather we address these items in more detail below 
these forward looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report 
earnings summary years ended consolidated diluted earnings per share of common stock 










consolidated diluted earnings per share of common stock continuing operations consolidated return on average common equity 
















earnings from continuing operations improved in primarily as a result of increased recognition of revenues previously deferred under a vpsb order described below  and from growth in retail sales of electricity to large and small commercial and industrial customers 
higher transmission expenses partially offset these benefits 
earnings from discontinued operations totaled 
per share in compared with 
per share in the prior year  reflecting diminished exposure to outstanding litigation against an inactive northern water resources subsidiary that led to reversal of previously recorded reserves 
in december  the vpsb approved a rate plan for the period through the rate plan  jointly proposed by the company and the vermont department of public service the department or the dps 
the rate plan provides the company with a stable  predictable rate path through  a plan for full recovery of the company s principal regulatory assets  and an improved opportunity for the company to earn its allowed rate of return through the rate plan calls for no retail rate increases in or  then scheduled increases of percent generating approximately million in added annual revenues effective january   and percent generating approximately million in added annual revenues effective january  the first of these rate increases has been implemented effective january  the rate plan sets the company s allowed return on equity from core utility operations at percent  effective with  and provides for an earnings cap at that level through the rate plan is summarized in more detail below under rates 
the vpsb s january rate order the settlement order allowed the company to defer revenues of approximately million  generated by leveling winter summer rates during  to help offset costs and realize our allowed rate of return during the period 
the rate plan permitted us to continue to defer and recognize these revenues in we recognized approximately million of these deferred revenues to achieve our allowed rate of return during  compared with approximately and million recognized in and  respectively 
retail operating revenues in increased by million or percent compared with  reflecting an improving economy  including a modest growth in the number of customers served  and increased recognition of revenues deferred under the rate plan discussed above 
total retail megawatt hour sales of electricity increased by percent in  compared with the same period in megawatt hour sales of electricity to large and small commercial and industrial customers increased by percent and percent  respectively  while sales to residential customers were flat when compared with  reflecting milder and more normal weather conditions in wholesale revenues in decreased by million compared with  reflecting reduced sales of electricity to morgan stanley capital group  inc  under a contract designed to manage price risks associated with changing fossil fuel prices 
the reduction in wholesale revenues did not adversely affect company earnings in and is not expected to adversely affect future operating results 
power supply expenses in decreased million compared with due to decreased wholesale sales of electricity  principally those associated with the morgan stanley contract 
power supply expense also decreased due to reduced expenses to supply an option contract with hydro quebec  and an increase in credits resulting from monthly financial transmission rights ftr auctions conducted by iso new england designed to make regions with inadequate transmission and generation pay a premium for energy delivery 
the company accounts for its wholly owned subsidiary  northern water resources nwr  as a discontinued operation 
nwr s assets and liabilities consist primarily of deferred tax assets and liabilities relating to a number of investments that the company has discontinued  deactivated  sold in part or retained as passive minority interests 
remaining holdings include a minority equity investment in a wind project that usually  but not always  generates tax losses  minority interest in a manufacturer of waste treatment equipment  and some non performing loans 
the company recognized income of 
per share from discontinued operations during  compared with earnings of 
in  primarily reflecting diminished exposure to outstanding litigation that led to reversal of previously recorded reserves 
all of these investments have been written off except for associated deferred tax amounts  net of applicable valuation allowances 
in  the company reported consolidated earnings of per share of common stock  diluted  compared to consolidated earnings of per share  diluted  in the improvement in earnings per share reflected reduced power supply expenses to serve retail sales  an increase in sales to residential customers and a reduction in the number of common shares outstanding 
these favorable developments more than offset increased administrative and general costs  a reduction in the company s allowed rate of return  increased interest expense in  and a decrease in the recognition of deferred revenues  compared with our financial health improved during and as a result  we were able to reduce our cost of capital in the fourth quarter of by issuing new long term debt and using a portion of the proceeds to acquire approximately  shares of our common stock 
our earnings per share improved by approximately per share as a result of the stock buyback 
critical accounting policies management believes our most critical accounting policies include the timing of expense and revenue recognition under the regulatory accounting framework within which we operate  the manner in which we account for certain power supply arrangements that qualify as derivatives  the assumptions that we make regarding defined benefit plans  and revenue recognition  particularly as it relates to unbilled and deferred revenues 
these accounting policies  among others  affect the company s significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america applicable to rate regulated enterprises in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for certain types of regulation 
under sfas  the company accounts for certain transactions in accordance with permitted regulatory treatment 
as such  regulators may permit incurred costs  typically treated as expenses by unregulated entities  to be deferred and expensed in future periods when recovered in future revenues 
costs are deferred as regulatory assets when the company concludes that future revenue will be provided to permit recovery of the previously incurred cost 
the company analyzes evidence supporting deferral  including provisions for recovery in regulatory orders  past regulatory precedent  other regulatory correspondence and legal representations 
conditions that could give rise to the discontinuance of sfas include increasing competition that restricts the company s ability to recover specific costs  and a change in the manner in which rates are set by regulators from cost based regulation to some other form of regulation 
in the event that the company no longer meets the criteria under sfas  the company would be required to write off its regulatory assets  net of regulatory liabilities as set forth in the table below regulatory assets and liabilities at december  regulatory assets in thousands demand side management programs 







  purchased power costs 












  pine street barge canal 











  net power supply deferral 










  other regulatory assets 











  total regulatory assets 











  regulatory liabilities rate levelization liability 









 accumulated cost of removal 









  other regulatory liabilities 









  total regulatory liabilities 









  regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities   the rate plan  approved by the vpsb in december  provides for amortization and recovery of nearly all of the regulatory assets listed above  beginning january  the pine street barge canal regulatory asset will be amortized over a period of years without a return on the remaining balance of the asset 
the remaining assets will be amortized over a five year period 
the net power supply deferral represents the net value of certain power supply contracts that must be marked to fair value as derivatives under current accounting rules 
the company records contract specified prices for electricity as expense in the period used  as opposed to fair market values reflected in the above table  in accordance with accounting required by a vpsb order 
the power supply contract expenses are fully recovered in the rates we charge  and are discussed in detail under power supply derivatives 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because the company has concluded that they are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
management s conclusions represent a critical accounting estimate 
regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to reduce future rates 
our operating revenues consist principally of retail sales of electricity at regulated rates 
revenue is recognized when electricity is delivered 
the company accrues utility revenues  based on estimates of electric service rendered and not billed at the end of an accounting period and net of estimates of electricity lost during transmission  in order to match revenues with related costs 
the company s defined benefit plan cost can vary significantly based on plan assumptions and results including the following factors interest rates  healthcare cost trends  return on assets and compensation cost trends 
management also exercises judgments about the expected outcome of litigation for contingencies 
if the company determines that it is probable that it will sustain a loss associated with pending litigation  regulatory proceedings or tax matters  and if it can estimate the likely amount of such loss  it will record a liability for that amount 
our critical accounting policies are discussed further below under item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and other factors  under liquidity and capital resources pension  in note a  significant accounting policies  in note h  pension and retirement plans and in note i  commitments and contingencies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and other risk factors 
we consider our principal risks to include power supply risks  our regulatory environment particularly as it relates to the company s periodic need for rate relief  risks associated with our principal customer  ibm  benefit plan cost sensitivity to interest rates and healthcare cost inflation and weather 
discussion of these and other risks  as well as factors contributing to mitigation of these risks  follows 
power supply risks 
power contract commitments the company s most significant power supply contracts are the hydro quebec vermont joint owners vjo contract the vjo contract and the vermont yankee nuclear power corporation vynpc contract the vynpc contract  which together supply approximately percent of our retail load 
the company has also entered into a contract with morgan stanley capital group  inc the morgan stanley contract designed to manage wholesale electricity price risks associated with changing fossil fuel prices 
the morgan stanley contract supplies an additional percent of our load and expires december  the vjo and vynpc contracts are summarized in the following table 
contract mwh mwh mwh mwh expires vjo contract 





  vermont yankee contract   the company s current purchases under the vjo contract with hydro quebec are as follows schedule b megawatts of firm capacity and associated energy to be delivered at the highgate interconnection for twenty years beginning in september  and schedule c megawatts of firm capacity and associated energy to be delivered at interconnections to be determined at any time for years  beginning in november on july   vynpc completed the sale of its nuclear power plant to entergy nuclear vermont yankee llc envy 
as part of the sale transaction  vynpc entered into a power purchase agreement ppa with envy under which envy is obligated to provide percent of the plant output to the company through  which represents approximately percent of our energy requirements 
prices under the ppa generally range from to per mwh 
the ppa contains a provision known as the low market adjuster  which calls for a downward adjustment in the price if market prices for electricity fall by defined amounts beginning in november we no longer bear the operating costs and risks associated with running and decommissioning the plant 
if market prices rise  however  ppa prices are not adjusted upward in excess of the contract price 
the company remains responsible for procuring replacement energy at market prices during periods of scheduled or unscheduled outages at the envy plant 
the company received million in october  representing its share of the vermont yankee power plant sale proceeds  and used the proceeds to retire debt 
in addition to the vjo and vynpc contracts  the company entered into the morgan stanley contract in in august  the morgan stanley contract was modified and extended to december  the morgan stanley contract price is substantially below current market prices 
the morgan stanley contract currently supplies approximately percent of the company s estimated customer demand load 
under the morgan stanley contract  on a daily basis  and at morgan stanley s discretion  we sell power to morgan stanley from part of our portfolio of power resources at pre defined operating and pricing parameters 
morgan stanley sells to the company  at a pre defined price  power sufficient to serve pre established load requirements 
we remain responsible for resource performance and availability 
the morgan stanley contract provides no coverage against major unscheduled power supply outages 
beginning january   the company reduced the power that it sells pursuant to the morgan stanley contract 
the output of some of our power supply resources  including purchases pursuant to our hydro quebec and vynpc contracts  which were sold to morgan stanley through  are no longer included in the morgan stanley contract 
this reduction in sales to morgan stanley reduced wholesale revenues by approximately million during when compared with  and correspondingly reduced power supply expense by a similar amount 
this change did not adversely affect the company s operating results or its opportunity to earn its allowed rate of return during in  the company entered into an agreement with hydro quebec the agreement under which hydro quebec paid million to the company in and we provided hydro quebec options for the purchase of power in specified maximum amounts through  as discussed below under power supply risk 
power supply price risk all of the company s power supply contract costs are currently being recovered through rates approved by the vpsb 
the company records the annual cost of power obtained under long term contracts as operating expenses 
the company meets the majority of its customer demand through a series of long term physical and financial contracts 
there are occasions when the available supply of electricity is insufficient to meet customer demand 
during those periods  electricity is purchased at market prices 
we expect approximately percent of our estimated load requirements through to be met by our contracts and generation and other power supply resources 
these contracts and resources significantly reduce the company s exposure to volatility in wholesale energy market prices 
a primary factor affecting future operating results is the volatility of the wholesale electricity market 
implementation of new england s wholesale market for electricity has increased volatility of wholesale power prices 
periods frequently occur when weather  availability of power supply resources and other factors cause significant differences between customer demand and electricity supply 
because electricity cannot be stored  in these situations the company must buy from or sell the difference into a marketplace that has experienced volatile energy prices 
market price trends also may make it more difficult to extend or enter into new power supply contracts at prices that avoid the need for rate relief 
vermont does not have an automatic fuel adjustment clause or similar mechanism to adjust rates for higher energy costs without prior regulatory approval 
the company has established a risk management program designed to mitigate some of the potential adverse cash flow and income statement effects caused by power supply risks  including credit risks associated with counterparties 
transactions permitted by the risk management program include futures  forward contracts  option contracts  swaps and the sale or purchase of transmission congestion rights 
these transactions are used to hedge the risk of fossil fuel and spot market electricity price increases 
some of these transactions present the risk of potential losses from adverse changes in commodity prices 
our risk management policy specifies risk measures  the amount of tolerable risk exposure and authorization limits for transactions 
our principal power supply contract counter parties and generators  hydro quebec  envy and morgan stanley  all currently have investment grade credit ratings 
power supply derivatives 
the morgan stanley contract is used to hedge our power supply costs against increases in fossil fuel prices 
the morgan stanley contract is a derivative under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
management has estimated the fair value of the future net benefit of this agreement at december  to be approximately million 
the company is unable to predict the price  contract duration or terms of any future power supply contract that could replace the morgan stanley contract after it expires on december  the company s agreement with hydro quebec grants hydro quebec an option to call power at prices that are now expected to be below estimated future wholesale market prices 
commencing april   and effective through the term of the vjo contract  which ends in  hydro quebec may purchase up to  mwh on an annual basis option a at the vjo contract energy price 
the cumulative amount of energy that may be purchased under option a may not exceed  mwh  mwh in each contract year 
over the same period  hydro quebec may exercise an option to purchase up to  mwh on an annual basis at the vjo contract energy price option b 
the cumulative amount of energy that may be purchased under option b may not exceed  mwh 
as of december   hydro quebec had purchased  mwh under option b 
the company expects hydro quebec to call its remaining entitlements of approximately  mwh under option b during hydro quebec exercised options a and b for  and the company purchased replacement power at a net cost of million 
the company has also covered percent of expected calls during at a net cost of million 
in  hydro quebec exercised option a and option b  and called for delivery to third parties at a net expense to the company of approximately million  including capacity charges 
the agreement is a derivative and is effective through management s estimate of the fair value of the future net cost for this agreement at december  is approximately million 
we sometimes use forward contracts to hedge forecasted calls by hydro quebec under the agreement and treat such contracts as derivatives under sfas the table below presents assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the morgan stanley contract and the agreement 
the forward prices for electricity used in this analysis are consistent with the company s current long term wholesale energy price forecast 
option value risk free price average contract model interest rate volatility forward price expires morgan stanley contract deterministic arrangement 



black scholes the table below presents the company s estimated market risk of the morgan stanley and hydro quebec derivatives  estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical ten percent adverse change in wholesale energy prices  which nets to million 
actual results may differ materially from the table illustration 
commodity price risk december  fair value cost market risk in thousands morgan stanley contract   agreement 




  under an accounting order issued by the vpsb  changes in the fair value of derivatives are deferred 
if a derivative instrument were terminated early because it is probable that a transaction or forecasted transaction will not occur  any gain or loss would be recognized in earnings immediately 
for derivatives held to maturity  the earnings impact is recorded in the period that the derivative is sold or matures 
other power supply risk 
under the vjo contract  hydro quebec has the right to reduce the load factor from percent to percent a total of three times over the life of the contract 
hydro quebec exercised the first of these load reduction options  effective for the year hydro quebec s exercise of this option increased power supply expense during by approximately million 
during  hydro quebec exercised its second option to reduce the load factor for  which increased power supply expense in by approximately million 
hydro quebec exercised its third and final option in to reduce deliveries occurring principally during  resulting in an estimated cost of replacement power of million  based on current wholesale market prices for it is possible our estimate of future power supply costs could differ materially from actual results 
the vermont joint owners  including the company  retain two options to increase the load factor to percent from percent after hydro quebec also retains the right under the vjo contract to curtail annual energy deliveries by percent up to five times  over the to period  if documented drought conditions exist in quebec 
hydro quebec has not exercised this right and has not communicated to the company any present intention to do so 
we sometimes experience energy delivery deficiencies under the vjo contract as a result of outages or other problems with the transmission interconnection facilities over which we schedule deliveries 
when such deficiencies occur  we purchase replacement energy on the wholesale market  usually at prices that are higher than vjo contract energy costs 
our vjo contract contains cross default provisions that allow hydro quebec to invoke step up provisions under which the other vermont utilities that are also parties to the contract would be required to purchase their proportionate share of the power supply entitlement of any defaulting utility 
the company is not aware of any instance where this provision has been invoked by hydro quebec 
in accordance with guidance set forth in fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  the company is required to disclose the maximum potential amount of future payments undiscounted the guarantor could be required to make under the guarantee 
such disclosure is required even if the likelihood of triggering the guarantee is remote 
in regards to the step up provision in the vjo contract  the company must assume that all members of the vjo simultaneously default in order to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments 
the company believes this is a highly unlikely scenario given that the majority of vjo members are regulated utilities with regulated cost recovery 
each vjo participant has received regulatory approval to recover the cost of this purchased power 
despite the remote chance that such an event could occur  the company estimates that its undiscounted purchase obligation would be approximately million for the remainder of the contract  assuming that all members of the vjo defaulted by january  and remained in default for the duration of the contract 
in such a scenario  the company would then own the power and could seek to recover its costs from the defaulting members  its retail customers  and or resell the power in the wholesale power markets in new england 
the range of outcomes full cost recovery  potential loss or potential profit would be highly dependent on vermont regulation and wholesale market prices at the time 
during  we estimate that the company paid an additional million for replacement power as the result of an unscheduled outage at the vermont yankee nuclear power plant 
during  another unscheduled outage resulted in the company s deferral of approximately  of added power supply costs 
while the vermont yankee plant has had an excellent operating record  future unscheduled outages could occur at times when replacement energy costs are above vynpc contract costs 
historically  the vpsb has allowed the company to defer  rather than expense  the higher costs resulting from extraordinary outages at the plant 
since the company no longer owns an interest in the vermont yankee nuclear plant  we are not responsible for any fixed costs at the plant  the costs of decommissioning the plant  nor are we responsible for any plant repairs or maintenance costs during outages 
on june   a fire in the electrical conduits leading to a transformer outside the plant resulted in a shutdown of the envy plant 
the outage ended on july  in response to the company s request  the vpsb issued a final accounting order allowing the company to defer its incremental replacement power costs during the outage totaling approximately  the order also instructs the company to apply any proceeds received under a ratepayer protection plan rpp to reduce the balance of deferred replacement power costs 
envy disputes that the fire was uprate related 
the company has petitioned the vpsb to resolve the dispute 
the rpp was a part of envy s request to uprate or increase the output of the vy nuclear plant that was approved by the vpsb 
under the rpp  we have indemnification rights to between approximately  and million to recover uprate related reductions in output for the three year period beginning in may and ending after completion of the uprate or a maximum of three years  depending on future wholesale energy market prices 
envy has announced that  under current operating parameters  it will exhaust the capacity of its existing nuclear waste storage pool in or and will need to store nuclear waste in so called dry fuel storage facilities to be constructed on the site 
current vermont law appears to require envy to obtain approval of the vermont state legislature  in addition to vpsb approval  to construct and use such dry fuel storage facilities 
if envy is unsuccessful in receiving favorable legislative action and or regulatory approval  envy has announced that it could be required to shut down the vy plant between and if the vy plant is shut down in or  we would have to acquire substitute baseload power resources  comprising approximately percent of our load 
at currently projected market prices  we estimate the annual incremental cost in excess of the projected costs of power under our power supply contract for output from the vy facility would be approximately million per year 
recovery of those increased costs in rates would require a rate increase of approximately percent 
in april  envy reported that two short spent fuel rod segments were not in what envy believed to be their documented location in the spent fuel pool 
after initial review and visual inspection of the spent fuel pool  envy did not locate the fuel rod segments 
by letter dated may   envy notified vynpc that based on the terms of the purchase and sale agreement dated august   and facts at that time  it was envy s view that costs associated with the spent fuel rod segment inspection effort were the responsibility of vynpc 
vynpc responded that based on the information at that time  there was no basis for envy to claim the inspection was vynpc s responsibility 
subsequently  envy discovered the fuel rod segments in a container in the spent fuel pool 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter at this time 
regulatory risk management believes that fair regulatory treatment is crucial to maintaining its financial stability  including its ability to attract capital 
vermont is the only state in the new england region that has not adopted some form of electric industry restructuring 
the company  like all other electric utilities in vermont  accordingly operates as a vertically integrated electric utility  with the obligation to serve all customers in our service territory with electrical transmission  distribution and energy supplies sufficient to satisfy customer load requirements 
vermont does not have a fuel or purchased power adjustment clause that would allow increases in power supply costs to be recovered immediately in the rates we charge customers 
historically  however  the vpsb has allowed electric utilities to defer material unexpected increases in power supply costs to future periods to permit recovery in future rates 
vermont law also allows electric utilities to seek temporary rate increases if deemed necessary by the vpsb to provide adequate and efficient service or to preserve the viability of the utility 
electric utility rates in vermont are set based on the utility s cost of service 
as a result  vermont electric utilities are subject to certain accounting standards that apply only to regulated businesses 
sfas allows regulated entities  including the company  in appropriate circumstances  to establish regulatory assets and liabilities  and thereby defer the income statement impact of certain costs and revenues that are expected to be realized in future rates 
the company has recognized revenues deferred under previous regulatory orders to help it earn its allowed rate of return see earnings summary 
the company s ability consistently to achieve its allowed rate of return is likely to be more uncertain prospectively due to the absence of available deferred revenues  unless it secures appropriate and adequate rate increases to cover its costs of operation 
the company invests in its utility infrastructure to serve its customers 
obtaining a return on that investment is a component in a rate increase proceeding that typically lasts for a period of approximately eight and one half months 
uncertainty regarding the outcome of rate proceedings contributes to the risk that we will not achieve our allowed rate of return in any given year 
regulatory risk is also affected by the amount of rate relief that the company needs to achieve its allowed rate of return 
since  the company has not needed any substantial rate relief 
in august we extended our morgan stanley contract before wholesale market power supply prices increased and we have been able to pass those benefits along to our customers 
our retail revenue needs through are covered by our rate plan 
the current morgan stanley contract expires on december  we estimate that we will need a rate increase of approximately to percent effective january   driven primarily by replacement power costs for our morgan stanley contract if the morgan stanley contract was replaced at current market prices  and higher projected transmission expenses 
central vermont public service corporation cvps is currently subject to a rate investigation by the vpsb 
in that case  the dps has advocated positions that  if adopted by the vpsb and applied to the company  could adversely affect our cash flows and operating results 
areas of risk include the department s advocacy for an earnings cap calculation that would potentially subject all items on the balance sheet and income statement to a retroactive review in order to determine whether the company has met or exceeded the earnings cap 
our rate plan provides that the company operate under an earnings cap through the company calculates its earnings under the cap in a manner that differs from the methodology advocated by the dps in the cvps rate proceeding 
dps advocacy for elimination or reduction of costs of future removal that are currently embedded in depreciation rates and reflected in our cash flows 
the methodology we currently employ is consistent with that used in most other regulatory jurisdictions 
dps advocacy for reduced rates of return on equity for cvps 
the company currently complies with the provisions of sfas if we had determined that the company no longer met the criteria for following sfas  at december   the company would write off its regulatory assets  net of regulatory liabilities see above discussion critical accounting policies 
factors that could give rise to the discontinuance of sfas include deregulation  a change in the regulators approach to setting rates from cost based regulation to another form of regulation  competition that limited our ability to sell utility services or products at rates that will recover costs  or regulatory actions that limit rate relief to a level insufficient to recover costs 
there are currently no regulatory proceedings  court actions or pending legislative proposals to adopt electric industry restructuring in vermont 
the largest category of costs that could be subject to the risk of non recovery in rates in the event of electric utility restructuring in vermont stranded costs are those relating to our future costs under long term power purchase contracts  which  based on current forecasts  are above market 
the magnitude of our stranded costs is largely dependent upon the future wholesale market price of power 
we have discussed various market price scenarios with interested parties for the purpose of identifying stranded costs 
based on preliminary market price assumptions  which are likely to change  we estimate the company s stranded costs to be between million and million over the life of the company s current contracts 
if vermont adopted retail competition or some other form of electric industry restructuring or if the vpsb issued a regulatory order containing provisions that did not allow the company to recover above market power costs  the company could be required to estimate and record losses immediately  on an undiscounted basis  for any above market power purchase contracts and other costs which are probable of not being recoverable from customers  to the extent that those costs can be estimated 
customer concentration risk ibm  the company s largest customer  operates a manufacturing facility in essex junction  vermont 
ibm s electricity requirements for its facility accounted for approximately  and percent of the company s retail mwh sales in  and  respectively  and  and percent of the company s retail operating revenues in  and  respectively 
no other retail customer accounted for more than one percent of the company s revenue in any year 
since  the company has had agreements with ibm with respect to electricity sales above agreed upon base load levels 
on december   the vpsb approved a new three year agreement between the company and ibm  ending december  the price of power under the agreement is above our marginal costs of providing incremental service to ibm 
ibm has reduced its vermont workforce by approximately  since  to a level of approximately  employees 
company revenue from sales of electricity to ibm increased by approximately  in compared with company revenue from sales of electricity to ibm declined million in compared with our operating results were not adversely impacted by the reduction in sales to ibm due to continued revenue growth in other customer classes and because the gross margin on sales to ibm is relatively low 
if we experienced a material reduction in earnings as a result of significantly lower retail sales  we would seek a retail rate increase from the vpsb 
the company is permitted to seek such a rate increase request under our approved rate plan 
we are not aware of any plans by ibm to further reduce production at its vermont facility 
we currently estimate  based on a number of projected variables  that a hypothetical shutdown of the ibm facility would necessitate a retail rate increase for all our remaining customers of approximately five percent 
pension and postretirement health care risk other critical accounting policies involve the company s defined benefit pension and postretirement health care benefit plans 
the reported costs of these plans depend upon numerous factors relating to actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
pension and postretirement health care costs are affected by actual employee demographics  company contributions to the plans  earnings on plan assets and  for our postretirement health care plan  health care cost trends 
the company contributed approximately million and million to its defined benefit plans during and  respectively  and we expect to contribute between and million during our pension and postretirement health care benefit plan assets consist of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns  as well as changes in general interest rates  may increase or decrease costs in future periods 
changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase or decrease recorded defined benefit plan costs 
on december   the company s employees ratified a four year labor agreement that provides annual wage increases of between and percent and improved k and pension benefits for employees 
the new labor agreement caps future postretirement healthcare employee benefits provided by the company for the majority of the present workforce 
the cap on postretirement healthcare benefits is set approximately percent above costs and grows at a percent annual rate 
this cap should reduce the rate at which postretirement healthcare expenses grow in the future 
as a result of our plan asset experience  at december   the company was required to recognize an additional minimum liability of million  net of applicable income taxes 
the liability was recorded as a reduction to common equity through a charge to other comprehensive income oci 
favorable pension plan investment returns during reduced the oci charge and related net liability by  in  a reduction in the pension plan s discount rate was primarily responsible for increasing the oci charge and related net liability by approximately  the and oci charge and the oci benefit had no effect on net income 
weather the company now uses weather insurance to mitigate some of the risk of lost electricity sales caused by unfavorable weather conditions 
the company has purchased weather insurance coverage for coverage is based on cumulative variations from normal weather  measured in net heating and cooling degree days

   increase decrease in operating revenues    nearly all of the company s earnings from continuing operations are typically generated by retail sales of electricity 
in  retail revenues increased million or percent compared with  due to an increase of million in recognition of revenues deferred under the rate plan  a percent increase in megawatt hour sales to large commercial and industrial customers resulting in a million increase in revenue  and a percent increase in megawatt hour sales to small commercial and industrial customers resulting in a million increase in revenue 
residential retail revenues and megawatt hour sales of electricity were up only percent in  compared with we experienced residential customer growth in  but weather conditions were less favorable for electricity sales than wholesale revenues decreased in by million  or percent  compared with  reflecting reduced sales of electricity under the morgan stanley contract 
the reduction in sales under the morgan stanley contract did not adversely affect the company s earnings in and is not expected to adversely affect the company s earnings in future years 
in  total electricity sales increased percent compared with  due to increased wholesale sales and sales to residential and small commercial and industrial customers  partially offset by decreased sales to large commercial and industrial customers 
total operating revenues increased million  or percent  compared with as a result of the following increased wholesale revenues of million  primarily due to increased system sales during peak demand periods and increased sales to hydro quebec under the agreement  increased retail residential revenues of million  or percent  arising from increased sales of electricity  and increased retail small commercial and industrial c i revenues of  or percent  arising from increased sales of electricity 
these increases were partially offset for the following reasons the company recognized million in deferred revenues under the settlement order  reduced from million recognized in  and decreased retail large c i revenues of million  or percent  when compared with  resulting from a decline in sales of electricity to this customer class 
power supply expenses power supply expenses constituted  and percent of total operating expenses for the years  and  respectively 
the decreased percentage reflects reduced purchases and sales of electricity under the morgan stanley contract 
power supply expenses decreased by million or percent in when compared with  and resulted from the following an estimated million decrease in the cost of power purchased for resale resulting primarily from the restructuring of the morgan stanley contract described above  a million increase in credits from the iso new england iso ne resulting from ftr auctions designed to make congested regions pay a premium for energy delivery  and credits for certain company generation  and a million decrease in the net cost of our agreement with hydro quebec 
these decreases were partially offset by increased power supply expenses from the following a million increase in purchases to supply increased retail sales  an estimated million in purchases to replace reduced energy deliveries under the vjo contract as a result of problems with the transmission interconnection facilities over which we schedule deliveries  and an  increase in the contract price per megawatt hour of electricity purchased under the morgan stanley contract 
power supply expenses increased by million  or percent  in when compared with  and resulted from the following an million increase in the cost of power purchased for resale  a million increase in power supply expenses under agreements with hydro quebec  higher costs of electricity supplied by independent power producers  and higher wholesale prices for electricity 
these increases were partially offset by an million decrease in the cost of power under our contract with morgan stanley and lower unit prices from vermont yankee 
other operating expenses other operating expenses in were essentially unchanged from the prior year 
other operating expenses increased million  or percent  in compared with primarily due to increased employee benefit expenses and expenses related to corporate governance 
transmission expenses transmission expenses increased  or percent  in compared with  due to increased charges allocated by iso ne for system support in the greater boston area and expensed engineering studies related to substation and transmission design evaluations 
the company s relative share of transmission expenses varies with the peak demand recorded on vermont s transmission system 
the company s share of those expenses increased due to its increased load growth  relative to other vermont utilities  and also because of increased transmission investment by velco 
in  we experienced an increase of approximately  in transmission expense resulting from system wide allocation of costs associated with voltage control and reactive power var in the greater boston area 
we expect this increased transmission expense to continue in the company and other affected load serving entities have requested iso ne to modify the applicable market rules to allocate var related costs to the reliability regions responsible for the applicable var related costs 
transmission expenses decreased  or percent  in compared with  due to decreased congestion costs allocated by iso ne to vermont utilities in conjunction with transition to a new standard market design smd 
see discussion below 
iso ne was created to manage the operations of the new england power pool nepool  effective may  iso ne operates a market for all new england states for purchasers and sellers of electricity in the deregulated wholesale energy markets 
sellers place bids for the sale of their generation or purchased power resources and if demand is high enough the output from those resources is sold 
iso ne implemented its standard market design smd plan governing wholesale energy sales in new england on march  smd includes a system of locational marginal pricing of energy  under which prices are determined by zone  and based in part on transmission congestion experienced in each zone 
currently  the state of vermont constitutes a single zone under the plan  although pricing could eventually be determined on a more localized nodal basis 
in december  ferc reaffirmed the zone pricing system for new england s smd  subject to ferc s periodic re analysis of alternative load zones  based on changes in system conditions 
we believe that nodal pricing could result in a material adverse impact on our power supply and or transmission costs  if adopted 
ferc has granted approval to iso ne to become a regional transmission organization rto for new england 
on february   iso ne commenced operations as the rto  providing regional transmission service in new england  with operational control of the bulk power system and responsibility for administering wholesale markets 
commencing with implementation of the rto  costs associated with certain transmission facilities  known as the highgate facilities  of which the company is a part owner  will be phased into region wide rates over a year period 
when fully phased in  we estimate that this roll in of the highgate facilities will achieve approximately million in annual transmission costs savings for the company 
velco  the owner and operator of vermont s principal electric transmission system assets  has proposed a project to substantially upgrade vermont s transmission system the northwest reliability project  principally to support reliability and eliminate transmission constraints in northwestern vermont  including most of the company s service territory 
we own approximately percent of velco 
in january  the project received regulatory approval from the vpsb 
the project is estimated to cost approximately million through velco intends to finance the costs of constructing the northwest reliability project in part through increased equity investment 
in october  the company invested million in velco to support this project and other transmission projects 
the company plans to invest at least million additionally in velco through for the same purpose 
under current nepool and iso ne rules  which require qualifying large transmission project costs to be shared among all new england utilities  approximately percent of the pool transmission facility costs of the northwest reliability project will be allocated throughout the new england region  with vermont utilities responsible for approximately percent of allocated costs 
vermont utilities are required to pay percent of pool transmission facility upgrades in other new england states 
maintenance expenses maintenance expenses increased  or percent  in compared with due to increased expenditures on right of way maintenance programs offset by decreased expenditures related to gas turbine maintenance 
maintenance expenses decreased  or percent  in compared with  due to decreased expenditures related to maintenance of our searsburg wind generation facility 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased  or percent  in compared with due to increases in depreciation of utility plant in service partially offset by decreased amortization of software costs 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased  or percent  in compared with due to reductions in amortization of conservation and software programs  partially offset by increased depreciation of utility plant in service 
taxes other than income taxes other than income taxes decreased  or percent  in compared with due to decreased property tax expense 
taxes other than income taxes decreased  or percent  in compared with for the same reason 
income taxes income tax expense increased  or percent  primarily due to an increase in pre tax income in compared with income tax expense decreased  or percent  in compared with due to a decrease in the company s pre tax income  an increase in non taxable income and the use of tax credits 
other income and deductions other income and deductions increased  in compared with due primarily to sales of non utility property offset by reduced earnings on investment in vermont yankee 
other income decreased  or percent  in compared with due primarily to vynpc recognition of deferred tax assets arising in conjunction with the sale of the vermont yankee plant and reduced earnings on investment in vynpc as a result of the sale of the vermont yankee plant in interest expense interest expense decreased  or percent  in compared with primarily due to scheduled redemptions of long term debt in december interest expense increased  or percent  in compared with primarily due to a million long term debt issuance in december environmental matters the electric industry typically uses or generates a range of potentially hazardous products in its operations 
we must meet various land  water  air and aesthetic requirements as administered by local  state and federal regulatory agencies 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with these requirements  and that there are no outstanding material complaints about our compliance with present environmental protection regulations 
the company joined the chicago climate exchange ccx  a self regulatory exchange that administers a market for reducing and trading greenhouse gas emission credits 
we are the first utility in the northeast to join the ccx  and have committed voluntarily to reduce our emissions by percent below our baseline average by  either directly or by purchasing credits 
pine street barge canal superfund site in  the company entered into a united states district court consent decree constituting a final settlement with the united states environmental protection agency epa  the state of vermont and numerous other parties of claims relating to a federal superfund site in burlington  vermont  known as the pine street barge canal 
the consent decree resolves claims by the epa for past site costs  natural resource damage claims and claims for past and future remediation costs 
the consent decree also provides for the design and implementation of response actions at the site 
in and  the company expended and million  respectively  to cover its obligations under the consent decree and we have estimated total future costs of the company s future obligations under the consent decree to be million 
the estimated liability is not discounted  and it is possible that our estimate of future costs could change by a material amount 
we have recorded a regulatory asset of million to reflect unrecovered past and future pine street costs 
pursuant to the company s rate plan  as approved by the vpsb  the company will begin to amortize past unrecovered costs in the company will amortize the full amount of incurred costs over years without a return 
the amortization will be allowed in future rates  without disallowance or adjustment  until fully amortized 
rates retail rate cases on december   the vpsb approved our rate plan  jointly proposed by the company and the dps 
the rate plan covers the period from through and includes the following principal elements the company s rates remained unchanged through the rate plan allows the company to raise rates percent  effective january   and an additional percent  effective january   if the increases are supported by cost of service schedules submitted days prior to the effective dates 
we submitted a cost of service schedule supporting the percent rate increase for in accordance with the plan 
the increase became effective on january  in accordance with the plan 
if the company s cost of service filing in established that a rate increase of less than percent is required for the company to meet its revenue requirements  the company would implement the lesser rate increase 
the vpsb retains the discretion to open an investigation of the company s rates at any time  at the request of the dps  the request of ratepayers  or on its own volition 
certain ratepayers requested the vpsb to open such an investigation in connection with the company s percent rate increase for the vpsb granted the request in december  and then  at our request  closed and terminated its investigation in january  with no adverse impact on the company s rates 
the company may seek additional rate increases in extraordinary circumstances  such as severe storm repair costs  natural disasters  extended unanticipated unit outages  or significant losses of customer load 
the company s allowed return on equity is percent for the period january  through december  during the same period  the company s earnings on core utility operations are capped at percent 
the company did not experience excess earnings in excess earnings in or will be refunded to customers as a credit on customer bills or applied to reduce regulatory assets  as the department directs 
the company carried forward into million in deferred revenue remaining at december   from the company s settlement order summarized below 
these revenues were applied in to offset increased costs 
the company will amortize recover certain regulatory assets  including pine street barge canal environmental site costs and past demand side management program costs  beginning in january  with those amortizations to be allowed in future rates 
pine street costs will be recovered over a twenty year period without a return 
the company filed with the vpsb in a new fully allocated cost of service study and rate re design  which allocates the company s revenue requirement among all customer classes on the basis of current costs 
the new rate design is subject to vpsb approval and is not expected to adversely affect operating results 
the company and the department have agreed to work cooperatively to develop and propose an alternative regulation plan as authorized by legislation enacted in vermont in if the company and department agree on such a plan  and it is approved by the vpsb  the alternative regulation plan would supersede the rate plan 
in january  the vpsb issued the settlement order  which included the following the company received a rate increase of percent above existing rates and prior temporary rate increases became permanent  rates were set at levels that recover the company s vjo contract costs  effectively ending the regulatory disallowances experienced by the company from through  seasonal rates were eliminated in april  which generated approximately million in additional cash flow in  which was deferred and available to be used to offset increased costs during and  and the company agreed to an earnings cap on core utility operations of percent return on equity  with amounts earned over the limit being used to write off regulatory assets 
the settlement order also imposed two additional conditions the company and customers shall share equally any premium above book value realized by the company in any future merger  acquisition or asset sale  subject to an million limit on the customers share  adjusted for inflation  and the company s further investment in non utility operations was restricted until new rates went into effect  which occurred in january although this restriction has expired  we have no plans to make material investments in non utility operations 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  net working capital and net operating cash flows are as follows at december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents 








 current assets 













  less current liabilities 








  net working capital 











  net cash provided by operating activities 
  we expect most of our construction expenditures and dividends to be financed by net cash provided by operating activities 
we anticipate that we will issue long term debt of approximately million in for scheduled first mortgage bond redemptions of million and to refinance accumulated short term debt 
material risks to cash flow from operations include regulatory risk  our customer concentration risk with ibm  slower than anticipated load growth  unfavorable economic conditions and increases in net power costs 
construction and investments our capital requirements result from the need to construct facilities or to invest in programs to meet anticipated customer demand for electric service 
the company plans to invest up to million in velco through  including million invested during our planned investments will fund in part an increase in the amount of equity in velco s capital structure and increased investment  principally driven by construction of the northwest reliability project and other vermont construction projects 
see detailed discussion under transmission expenses 
future capital expenditures are expected to approximate million annually 
expected reductions in pine street remediation costs should be offset by increased generation expenditures 
capital expenditures over the past three years and forecasted for are as follows generation transmission distribution other total in thousands actual forecast other includes pine street barge canal net expenditures of million in  million in  million in and an estimated  in dividend policy on february   the annual dividend rate was increased from per share to per share  a payout ratio of approximately percent based on earnings from continuing operations 
on february   the annual dividend rate was increased from per share to per share  a payout ratio of approximately percent based on earnings 
the annual dividend was per share for the year ended december  the annual dividend rate was increased by the company s board of directors from per share to per share beginning with the quarterly dividend declared in december the company expects to increase the dividend in the first quarter of each year until the payout ratio falls in the middle of a payout range of between percent and percent of anticipated earnings  so long as financial and operating results permit 
we believe this payout ratio to be consistent with that of other electric utilities having similar risk profiles 
financing and capitalization during june  the company negotiated a day revolving credit agreement the fleet sovereign agreement with fleet financial services fleet joined by sovereign bank 
the fleet sovereign agreement is for million  unsecured  and allows the company to choose any blend of a daily variable prime rate and a fixed term libor based rate 
there was million outstanding on the fleet sovereign agreement at december  at an average rate of percent 
there was no non utility short term debt outstanding at december  or the fleet sovereign agreement expires june  the company anticipates that it will secure financing that replaces some or all of its expiring facilities during during  we redeemed million of percent first mortgage bonds and million of outstanding preferred stock 
in  we also completed a dutch auction self tender offer and repurchased  shares  or approximately percent  of the company s common stock outstanding for approximately million 
the credit ratings of the company s first mortgage bonds at december  were moody s standard poor s first mortgage bonds baa bbb on june  moody s affirmed the company senior secured debt rating at baa  with a stable outlook 
on november   standard and poor s ratings services upgraded the company s issuer credit rating to bbb from bbb  citing an improved regulatory climate in vermont 
standard and poor s ratings services also affirmed its bbb rating of the company s senior secured debt  with a stable outlook 
in the event of a change in the company s first mortgage bond credit rating to below investment grade  scheduled payments under the company s first mortgage bonds would not be affected 
such a change would require the company to post what would currently amount to a million bond under our remediation agreement with the epa regarding the pine street barge canal site 
the morgan stanley contract requires credit assurances if the company s first mortgage bond credit ratings are lowered to below investment grade by either of the credit rating agencies listed above

we have material power supply commitments that are discussed in detail under the captions power contract commitments and power supply expenses 
we also own an equity interest in velco  which requires the company to pay a portion of velco s operating costs  including its debt service costs 
other risks the town of rockingham  vermont  located in the southeastern portion of our service territory  has exercised an option to purchase a hydro electric facility partially located in the town the bellows falls facility 
if rockingham or its assignee is successful in arranging for purchase of the bellows falls facility  we expect to conclude an agreement to permit rockingham to be responsible for its own power supply needs  with the company providing distribution and other services to the town 
in any such agreement the company would continue to own its distribution plant located in the town and receive distribution services revenues sufficient to cover all costs of providing services and all stranded costs associated with the company s present obligation to provide integrated electric service to customers in rockingham 
such an arrangement would require vpsb approval 
the company receives annual revenues of approximately million from its customers in rockingham 
in  the owners of property along the shoreline of joe s pond  an impoundment located in danville  vermont  created by the company s west danville hydroelectric generating facility  filed an inquiry with the vpsb seeking review of certain dam improvements made by the company in  alleging that the company did not obtain all necessary regulatory approvals for the improvements and that the company s improvements and subsequent operation of the dam have caused flooding of the shoreline and property damage 
the company received vpsb approval for  and has made additional dam improvements  at the facility 
the vpsb has pending a regulatory proceeding to determine whether to impose regulatory penalties in connection with the dam improvements 
effects of inflation financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and report operating results in terms of historic costs 
this accounting provides reasonable financial statements but does not always take inflation into consideration 
as rate recovery is based on these historical costs and known and measurable changes  the company is able to receive some rate relief for inflation 
it does not receive immediate rate recovery relating to fixed costs associated with company assets 
such fixed costs are recovered based on historic figures 
any effects of inflation on plant costs are generally offset by the fact that these assets are financed through long term debt
