item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
overview america s car mart  inc  a texas corporation the company  is the largest publicly held automotive retailer in the united states focused exclusively on the buy here pay here segment of the used car market 
references to the company typically include the company s consolidated subsidiaries 
the company s operations are principally conducted through its two operating subsidiaries  america s car mart  inc  an arkansas corporation car mart of arkansas  and colonial auto finance  inc colonial 
collectively  car mart of arkansas and colonial are referred to herein as car mart 
the company primarily sells older model used vehicles and provides financing for substantially all of its customers 
many of the company s customers have limited financial resources and would not qualify for conventional financing as a result of limited credit histories or past credit problems 
as of april   the company operated stores located primarily in small cities throughout the south central united states 
car mart has been operating since car mart has grown its revenues between and per year over the last eight years 
finance receivables tend to grow slightly faster than revenues 
growth results from same store revenue growth and the addition of new stores 
revenue growth in fiscal was in line with the company s growth expectations of to 
revenue growth in fiscal was assisted by a increase in the average retail sales price 
typically  annual price increases are in the to range 
as discussed below  the more significant increase in the average retail sales price in fiscal stems from a decision in late fiscal to substantially reduce the sale of lower priced vehicles and begin selling slightly higher priced vehicles 
presently  the company expects that its average retail sales price will increase in fiscal  but at a rate closer to its historical average annual price increase 
as a result  revenue growth for fiscal is presently expected to be in the to range 
the company s primary focus is on collections 
each store is responsible for its own collections with supervisory involvement of the corporate office 
over the last eight fiscal years  car mart s credit losses as a percentage of sales have ranged between approximately and average of 
credit losses in fiscal were slightly higher than the company s average over the last eight years 
the company believes the higher credit losses in fiscal were the result of the continuing effects of selling more lower priced vehicles through january in the beginning of the prior fiscal year may  the company made the decision to sell more lower priced vehicles as they have higher gross margin percentages and are more affordable to the company s customers 
however  historical data indicates that loans on lower priced vehicles have higher charge off experience than loans on higher priced vehicles 
lower priced vehicles tend to have more mechanical difficulties that often result in a higher level of repossessions 
as a result of higher than normal charge off experience and slower revenue growth from selling lower priced vehicles  in february the company decided to substantially reduce its purchase and sale of lower priced vehicles and began purchasing and selling slightly higher priced vehicles 
the effects of the company s february decision to reduce its purchase and sale of lower priced vehicles is reflected in the lower provision for credit losses  as a percentage of sales  in fiscal when compared to fiscal 
the company s gross margins as a percentage of sales have been fairly consistent from year to year 
over the last eight years car mart s gross margins  as a percentage of sales  have ranged between approximately and 
gross margins as a percentage of sales in fiscal were  down from in fiscal the company s gross margins are set based upon the cost of the vehicle purchased with lower priced vehicles having higher gross margin percentages 
as a result of the company s decision in february to shift away from the sale of lower priced vehicles to slightly higher priced vehicles  the company s gross margins  as a percentage of sales  decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal hiring  training and retaining qualified associates are critical to the company s success 
the rate at which the company adds new stores is sometimes limited by the number of trained managers the company has at its disposal 
excessive turnover  particularly at the store manager level  could impact the company s ability to add new stores 
in fiscal  the company added resources to train and develop personnel 
the company expects to continue to invest in the development of its workforce in fiscal and beyond

revenues increased in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase in revenue growth is attributable to a much larger increase in the average retail sales price in fiscal as compared to fiscal 
as discussed in the overview above  in february the company made the decision to substantially reduce its purchase and sale of lower priced vehicles and began purchasing and selling slightly higher priced vehicles 
the company expects that its average retail sales price will increase in fiscal  but at a rate closer to its historical average annual price increase of to 
cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was principally the result of the company s decision to i substantially reduce the purchase and sale of lower priced vehicles which carry higher gross profit margin percentages  ii purchase slightly higher priced vehicles for sale which carry lower gross profit margin percentages  iii perform repairs of more vehicles in inventory without passing on the added cost  and iv assist in the repair of more customers vehicles 
selling  general and administrative expense  as a percentage of sales  increased 
to in fiscal from in fiscal the percentage increase is attributable to external costs related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  which costs amounted to approximately 
million in fiscal  or 
of sales  with no corresponding amount in the prior fiscal year 
presently  the company expects these costs to decrease in fiscal as a percentage of sales  compensation costs decreased slightly in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is partially the result of selling higher priced vehicles 
selling higher priced vehicles increases sales without necessarily increasing compensation expense 
the company does expect to incur more costs in its information technology department in fiscal to strengthen its controls and improve the efficiency of the company s operations 
provision for credit losses  as a percentage of sales  decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of lower charge offs as a percentage of sales 
as discussed in the overview section above  the company believes it is experiencing the positive effects on credit losses of its february decision to reduce the purchase and sale of lower priced vehicles 
historically  loans on lower priced vehicles have had higher charge off experience than loans on higher priced vehicles 
also  in comparison to the prior fiscal year  the company believes that it has become more selective in approving credit in connection with the sale of its vehicles 
the company believes the slightly tighter credit standard could be a factor in reducing credit losses as a percentage of sales in the future 
interest expense  as a percentage of sales  decreased 
to 
in fiscal from 
in fiscal the decrease was principally the result of a lower level of borrowings relative to the sales volume of the company 
compared to revenues increased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal principally as a result of i revenue growth from stores that operated a full twelve months in both periods million  or  ii revenue growth from stores opened during fiscal or stores that opened or closed a satellite location during fiscal or fiscal million  and iii revenues from stores opened during fiscal million 
same store revenue growth slowed to in fiscal from in fiscal principally as a result of a smaller increase in the average retail sales price in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and more conservative underwriting practices beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal the slowing of growth in the average retail sales price stems from a decision at the beginning of fiscal to sell a higher percentage of lower priced vehicles 
although lower priced vehicles have higher gross margin percentages  and are more affordable than higher priced vehicles  selling lower priced vehicles has a negative impact on revenue growth  and  as discussed below  loans on lower priced vehicles have higher charge off experience than loans on higher priced vehicles 
as a result of the negative impact on revenue growth and the higher charge off experience  during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company decided to substantially reduce its purchase and sale of lower priced vehicles and began purchasing and selling slightly higher priced vehicles 
revenue growth slowed to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal principally as a result of i the lower same store revenue growth discussed above  ii fewer new lot openings in fiscal seven new lots opened  one satellite lot closed as compared to fiscal nine new lots opened  and iii the timing of new lot openings in fiscal as compared to fiscal lot openings in fiscal occurred later in the year as compared to fiscal 
cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decrease was principally the result of i selling a higher percentage of lower priced vehicles during the first nine months of fiscal lower priced vehicles have higher gross margin percentages than higher priced vehicles  ii the company s decision in late december to raise prices by about  or  on most of the vehicles it sells  and iii encouraging store managers to more closely adhere to the company s pricing matrix and not to use their discretionary authority to discount the sales price of vehicles 
selling  general and administrative expense  as a percentage of sales  decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decrease was principally the result of i lower compensation expense at its irving  texas office in connection with the relocation of the company s principal headquarters from irving  texas to bentonville  arkansas during fiscal  and ii lower compensation expense in connection with a change in the senior management bonus program  partially offset by higher insurance and advertising costs 
provision for credit losses  as a percentage of sales  increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of higher charge offs as a percentage of sales and an increase of the company s allowance for credit losses as a percentage of finance receivable principal balances 
as discussed above  the company believes the increase in charge offs was partially attributable to a decision at the beginning of fiscal to sell a higher percentage of lower priced vehicles 
lower priced vehicles have higher margins on a percentage basis and are more affordable to the company s customers 
however  historical data indicates that loans on lower priced vehicles have higher charge off experience than loans on higher priced vehicles 
as a result of the negative impact on revenue growth as discussed above and higher than normal charge off experience  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company decided to substantially reduce its purchase and sale of lower priced vehicles and began purchasing and selling slightly higher priced vehicles 
in february  the company formally adopted additional delinquency standards for its larger stores 
the additional delinquency standards prescribe the percentage of accounts at larger stores that can be to days past due  to days past due and over days past due 
previously  the company only had delinquency standards for accounts one and two weeks past due and three or more weeks past due 
as a result of the tightening of its delinquency standards  at april   the percentage of accounts over days past due had been reduced to  from at april  the company believes that in the long run the adoption of the additional delinquency standards will assist the company in reducing charge offs  as well as maintaining the percentage of accounts over days past due at historically lower levels 
with the additional delinquency standards  store managers and collection personnel are motivated monthly store team bonuses are tied to meeting delinquency and account loss standards to address severely past due accounts on a more timely basis  which management believes will result in fewer accounts being charged off 
as a result of the higher charge offs discussed above  the company determined it was necessary to increase its overall allowance for credit losses 
during fiscal  the company increased its allowance for credit losses by basis points  from of finance receivable principal balances at april   to of finance receivable principal balances at april  interest expense  as a percentage of sales  decreased to 
in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decrease was principally the result of i a decrease in the rate charged on the company s revolving credit facility the rate was reduced by basis points in november  and ii a lower level of borrowings relative to the sales volume of the company 
financial condition the following table sets forth the major balance sheet accounts of the company at april   and in thousands april  assets finance receivables  net inventory property and equipment  net liabilities accounts payable and accrued liabilities revolving credit facilities historically  finance receivables tend to grow slightly faster than revenue growth 
this is due to a gradually increasing average term necessitated by increases in the average retail sales price 
in fiscal  finance receivables  net grew as compared to revenue growth of 
in fiscal  finance receivables  net grew as compared to revenue growth of 
the company expects the historical relationship between net finance receivable growth and revenue growth to continue in the future 
in fiscal  inventory grew by as compared to revenue growth of 
inventory grew at a faster pace than revenues as a result of the company s decision to i increase the level of inventory it carries at many of its stores to facilitate sales growth  and ii increase the average inventory cost per unit in a conscious effort to sell a slightly higher priced vehicle 
in fiscal  the average retail sales price increased over fiscal inventory increased million during fiscal as the company made the decision to carry more inventories per store  and late in fiscal the company made the decision to begin selling slightly higher priced vehicles 
property and equipment  net increased million in fiscal as the company purchased real estate for a number of new stores and relocated some existing stores to purchased property 
the company also refurbished and expanded a number of existing stores to facilitate revenue growth 
in fiscal  property and equipment  net only increased by million as many new store openings were located on leased property 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities have been fairly consistent from year to year 
borrowings on the company s revolving credit facilities fluctuate primarily based upon a number of factors including i net income  ii finance receivables growth  and iii capital expenditures 
historically  income from continuing operations has funded the majority of finance receivables growth and borrowings from its credit facilities have been used to purchase capital assets 
the level of stock repurchases also affects the company s borrowings under its revolving credit facilities 
liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth certain historical information with respect to the company s statements of cash flows in thousands years ended april  operating activities income from continuing operations provision for credit losses finance receivable originations finance receivable collections inventory income tax and other receivables other total investing activities purchase of property and equipment note collections from discontinued operations sale of discontinued operations total financing activities revolving credit facility  net repayment of other debt purchase of common stock exercise of stock options and warrants total cash provided by used in continuing operations the company generates cash flow from income from continuing operations 
most or all of this cash is used to fund finance receivables growth 
to the extent finance receivables growth exceeds income from continuing operations  generally the company increases its borrowings under its revolving credit facilities 
the majority of the company s growth is self funded 
the company has had a tendency to lease the majority of the properties where its stores are located 
as of april   the company leased approximately of its store properties 
the company expects to continue to lease the majority of the properties where its stores are located 
car mart s revolving credit facilities limit distributions from car mart to the company beyond i the repayment of an intercompany loan million at april   and ii dividends equal to of car mart of arkansas net income 
at april   the company s assets excluding its million equity investment in car mart consisted of 
million in cash  million in other assets and a million receivable from car mart 
thus  the company is limited in the amount of dividends or other distributions it can make to its shareholders without the consent of car mart s lender 
beginning in february  car mart assumed substantially all of the operating costs of the company 
at april   the company had 
million of cash on hand and an additional million of availability under its revolving credit facilities 
on a short term basis  the company s principal sources of liquidity include income from continuing operations and borrowings from its revolving credit facilities 
on a longer term basis  the company expects its principal sources of liquidity to consist of income from continuing operations and borrowings from revolving credit facilities 
further  while the company has no present plans to issue debt or equity securities  the company believes  if necessary  it could raise additional capital through the issuance of such securities 
the company expects to use cash to i grow its finance receivables portfolio by a percentage that is slightly larger than the percentage that its revenues grow  ii purchase property and equipment of approximately to million in the next twelve months in connection with opening new stores and refurbishing existing stores  and iii to the extent excess cash is available  reduce debt 
in addition  from time to time the company may use cash to repurchase its common stock 
the company s revolving credit facilities mature in april the company expects that it will be able to renew or refinance its revolving credit facilities on or before the date they mature 
the company believes it will have adequate liquidity to satisfy its capital needs for the foreseeable future 
contractual payment obligations the following is a summary of the company s contractual obligations as of april   including renewal periods under operating leases that are reasonably assured in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years debt operating leases total the million of lease commitments includes million of non cancelable lease commitments under the primary lease terms  and million of lease commitments for renewal periods at the company s option that are reasonably assured 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has entered into operating leases for approximately of its store and office facilities 
generally these leases are for periods of three to five years and usually contain multiple renewal options 
the company uses leasing arrangements to maintain flexibility in its store locations and to preserve capital 
the company expects to continue to lease the majority of its store and office facilities under arrangements substantially consistent with the past 
for the years ended april   and rent expense for all operating leases amounted to approximately million  million and million  respectively 
other than its operating leases  the company is not a party to any off balance sheet arrangement that management believes is reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires the company to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from the company s estimates 
the company believes the most significant estimate made in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements relates to the determination of its allowance for credit losses  which is discussed below 
the company s accounting policies are discussed in note b in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains an allowance for credit losses on an aggregate basis at a level it considers sufficient to cover estimated losses in the collection of its finance receivables 
the allowance for credit losses is based primarily upon historical credit loss experience  with consideration given to recent credit loss trends and changes in loan characteristics ie  average amount financed and term  delinquency levels  collateral values  economic conditions and underwriting and collection practices 
the allowance for credit losses is periodically reviewed by management with any changes reflected in current operations 
although it is at least reasonably possible that events or circumstances could occur in the future that are not presently foreseen which could cause actual credit losses to be materially different from the recorded allowance for credit losses  the company believes that it has given appropriate consideration to all relevant factors and has made reasonable assumptions in determining the allowance for credit losses 
recent accounting pronouncement in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards r  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas  except that sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under sfas r 
sfas r was originally issued with implementation required for interim and annual periods beginning after june  on april   the securities and exchange commission delayed the required effective date of sfas r to the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after june  the company is evaluating the requirements of sfas r 
the company has not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  and it has not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas the company expects to adopt sfas r on may  seasonality the company s automobile sales and finance business is seasonal in nature 
the company s third fiscal quarter november through january is historically the slowest period for car and truck sales 
many of the company s operating expenses such as administrative personnel  rent and insurance are fixed and cannot be reduced during periods of decreased sales 
conversely  the company s fourth fiscal quarter february through april is historically the busiest time for car and truck sales as many of the company s customers use income tax refunds as a down payment on the purchase of a vehicle 
further  the company experiences seasonal fluctuations in its finance receivable credit losses 
as a percentage of sales  the company s first and fourth fiscal quarters tend to have lower credit losses averaging over the last eight years  while its second and third fiscal quarters tend to have higher credit losses averaging over the last eight years 
impact of inflation inflation has not historically been a significant factor impacting the company s results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk on its financial instruments from changes in interest rates 
in particular  the company has exposure to changes in the federal primary credit rate and the prime interest rate of its lender 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes or to manage interest rate risk 
the company s earnings are impacted by its net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on interest bearing assets and the interest paid on interest bearing notes payable 
as described below  a decrease in market interest rates would generally have an adverse effect on the company s profitability 
the company s financial instruments consist of fixed rate finance receivables and variable rate notes payable 
the company s finance receivables generally bear interest at fixed rates ranging from to 
these finance receivables generally have remaining maturities from one to months 
the company s borrowings contain variable interest rates that fluctuate with market interest rates ie  the rate charged on the company s revolving credit facility fluctuates with the prime interest rate of its lender 
however  interest rates charged on finance receivables originated in the state of arkansas are limited to the federal primary credit rate at april  plus 
typically  the company charges interest on its arkansas loans at or near the maximum rate allowed by law 
thus  while the interest rates charged on the company s loans do not fluctuate once established  new loans originated in arkansas are set at a spread above the federal primary credit rate which does fluctuate 
at april   approximately of the company s finance receivables were originated in arkansas 
assuming that this percentage is held constant for future loan originations  the long term effect of decreases in the federal primary credit rate would generally have a negative effect on the profitability of the company 
this is the case because the amount of interest income lost on arkansas originated loans would likely exceed the amount of interest expense saved on the company s variable rate borrowings assuming the prime interest rate of its lender decreases by the same percentage as the decrease in the federal primary credit rate 
the initial impact on profitability resulting from a decrease in the federal primary credit rate and the rate charged on its variable interest rate borrowings would be positive  as the immediate interest expense savings would outweigh the loss of interest income on new loan originations 
however  as the amount of new loans originated at the lower interest rate increases to an amount in excess of the amount of variable interest rate borrowings  the effect on profitability would become negative 
the table below illustrates the estimated impact that hypothetical changes in the federal primary credit rate would have on the company s continuing pretax earnings 
the calculations assume i the increase or decrease in the federal primary credit rate remains in effect for two years  ii the increase or decrease in the federal primary credit rate results in a like increase or decrease in the rate charged on the company s variable rate borrowings  iii the principal amount of finance receivables million and variable interest rate borrowings million  and the percentage of arkansas originated finance receivables  remain constant during the periods  and iv the company s historical collection and charge off experience continues throughout the periods 
year year increase decrease increase decrease increase decrease in interest rates in pretax earnings in pretax earnings in thousands in thousands basis points basis points basis points basis points a similar calculation and table was prepared at april  the calculation and table were materially consistent with the information provided above
