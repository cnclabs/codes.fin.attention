item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business summary we are a real estate investment trust  or reit  and own a portfolio of primarily upper upscale  full service hotels and resorts 
our portfolio is diversified geographically as well as by franchise and brand affiliations 
as of december   we owned hotels with  rooms 
our hotels are located in major metropolitan areas  rapidly growing secondary markets or resort locations in the united states 
all of our hotels are leased by our taxable subsidiaries 
as of december   hotels were managed by interstate hotels resorts interstate hotels  which was created on july  through the merger of meristar hotels resorts  inc and interstate hotels corporation  one hotel was managed by the ritz carlton hotel company  llc ritz carlton  a subsidiary of marriott international  inc  and one hotel was managed by another subsidiary of marriott international  inc marriott collectively with interstate hotels  the managers 
the managers operate the hotels we owned as of december  pursuant to management agreements with our taxable subsidiaries 
under these management agreements  each taxable subsidiary pays a management fee for each property to the manager of its hotels 
the taxable subsidiaries in turn make rental payments to our subsidiary operating partnership under the participating leases 
under the interstate hotels management agreements  the base management fee is of total hotel revenue  plus incentive payments based on meeting performance thresholds that could total up to an additional of total hotel revenue 
the agreements have initial terms expiring on january  with three renewal periods of five years each at the option of interstate hotels  subject to some exceptions 
under the ritz carlton and marriott management agreements  the base management fee is and of total hotel revenue  respectively  through and under both thereafter  plus incentive payments based on meeting performance thresholds that could total up to an additional of total revenue and of available cash flow as defined in the relevant management agreement  respectively 
the agreements have initial terms expiring in and  respectively  with four and three renewal periods of and five years each  respectively  at the option of ritz carlton and marriott 
the ritz carlton and marriott management agreements include certain limited performance guarantees by the relevant manager which are designed primarily to provide downside performance protection and run through and up to  respectively 
during  we recorded a total amount of million under the ritz carlton and marriott limited performance guarantees  combined 
management  based upon budgets and operating trends  expects payments under these guarantees in the future to be minimal 
since the july merger that formed interstate hotels  we and interstate hotels have separated the senior management teams of the two companies in order to allow each senior management team to devote more attention to its respective company s matters 
in december  meristar hospitality s board of directors and that of interstate hotels each formed a special committee of independent directors to explore further changes to the relationship between our company and interstate hotels  including possible changes to the terms  or complete elimination  of the intercompany agreement 
during july  we concluded negotiations with interstate hotels to terminate the intercompany agreement 
in exchange for terminating the intercompany agreement  we received  among other things the right to terminate up to rooms per year upon the payment of a termination fee equal to times the fees earned during the preceding months  with the ability to carry over up to rooms for termination in the succeeding year  the right to terminate the management contract of a hotel  where interstate hotels invests in a competing hotel  with no termination fee  and 
table of contents an extension of the termination fee payment period for terminations related to hotel sales  from months to months 
the termination of the intercompany agreement eliminates the last element of our original paper clip relationship with interstate hotels 
separately  we reached an agreement with interstate hotels regarding the calculation of termination fees payable upon a sale 
although termination fees for the properties that have been disposed of or were expected to be disposed of under our previously announced disposition program which includes one of the properties we owned as of december  will be unchanged  we received a million credit  which is applicable to fees payable with respect to future dispositions 
of the million credit  million has been applied to terminations that have occurred during results overview general at the beginning of  we set out a strategy to position our company to best take advantage of an expected economic and industry recovery 
this strategy included an asset disposition program  which we had substantially completed from the beginning of through the end of  having disposed of assets for million of gross cash proceeds and million in reduction of debt  allowing us to significantly enhance our liquidity while repositioning our portfolio 
we believe that we are in the midst of the early stages of a lodging industry economic recovery  however  the recovery is not uniform throughout the country 
certain of our markets are performing well  while others have not yet recovered 
our strategy currently includes the following key initiatives focus on growth of earnings and cash flow from our existing portfolio using an aggressive asset management program  upgrade our portfolio through extensive renovations  recycle capital into higher yielding hotel investments  improve our capital structure to support internal growth  position the company for external opportunities and increase our fixed charges coverage  maintain upside potential  and maintain liquidity 
we are in the process of upgrading the product quality and growth potential of our hotels through our aggressive capital expenditure program and selective brand conversions 
we have continued to reshape our portfolio through three strategic  high quality acquisitions  including one investment completed in october  and dispositions of a number of lower yielding properties 
we have developed a targeted renovation program that is designed to reduce the time and cost required to renovate hotels  allowing us to improve the quality of our hotels faster to take advantage of the rebound in the economy and better control the level of disruption associated with renovations 
during the year  we accelerated our renovation program for certain key assets  which created some short term disruption  but also positioned us to participate more quickly in the lodging industry recovery 
we invested approximately million in capital expenditures during  and we expect to invest approximately million in capital expenditures during  including million to complete projects started in and excluding hurricane related capital expenditures  to enhance the quality of our portfolio to meet or exceed the standards of our primary brands hilton  marriott  and starwood as well as to improve the competitiveness of these assets in their markets and enable them to more fully participate in the economic recovery 
while hotel results are negatively impacted during renovations due to out of service rooms and limitations on the ability to sell other hotel services  we expect to have positioned these renovated properties well to be able to benefit from the economic recovery 
the amount of hurricane related capital expenditures has not yet been fully determined  however  we anticipate it to well exceed million  most of which we expect to be reimbursed by our insurance carriers 
since the beginning of  we have completed seven brand conversions at the sheraton bellevue  holiday inn walt disney world village  doubletree universal  doubletree hotel dallas galleria  sheraton 
table of contents beach resort key largo  crowne plaza chicago o hare  and sheraton oklahoma city hotels with  total rooms 
we experienced short term negative impacts of these brand conversions during due to customer displacement  renovation work and initial costs of training and marketing associated with brand conversions 
however  we expect the conversions to generate long term positive results at these hotels due to better alignment of hotel characteristics to the brand or a more beneficial cost structure 
the august september hurricanes in august and september  hurricanes caused substantial damage to a number of our hotels located in florida 
the hurricane damage and local evacuation orders also caused significant business interruption at many of our florida properties  including the complete closure of certain hotels 
as a result  eight of our hotels were closed for an extended period of time  and five others were affected in varying degrees 
we have comprehensive insurance coverage for both property damage and business interruption 
our damage assessment teams  working with the adjusters for our insurance providers  are inspecting each of our affected properties and implementing restoration plans 
some properties will require substantial repair and reconstruction and will remain closed until such repairs are complete 
our recovery effort is extensive and includes replacing portions of buildings  landscaping and furniture  as well as upgrading to comply with changes in building and electrical codes 
the net book value of the property damage is currently estimated to be at least million  however  we are still assessing the impact of the hurricanes on our properties  and actual net book value write offs could vary from this estimate 
changes to this estimate will be recorded in the periods in which they are determined 
for the year ended december   we have recorded a net fixed asset write off and a corresponding insurance claim receivable for this million net book value amount because we believe that it is probable that the insurance recovery  net of deductibles  will significantly exceed the net book value of the damaged portion of these assets 
the recovery is based on replacement cost  and we have submitted claims substantially in excess of million 
while we expect the insurance proceeds will be sufficient to cover most of the replacement cost of the restoration of these hotels  certain deductibles primarily windstorm and limitations will apply 
moreover  no determination has been made as to the total amount or timing of those insurance payments  and those insurance payments may not be sufficient to cover the costs of all the restoration of the hotels 
to the extent that insurance proceeds  which are on a replacement cost basis  ultimately exceed the net book value of the damaged property  a gain will be recorded in the period when all contingencies related to the insurance claim have been resolved 
as of december  and march   seven of our florida properties remained completely closed due to hurricane damage 
additionally  as of december   four properties that suffered varying amounts of hurricane damage had certain rooms and conference facilities out of service 
where possible and in order to mitigate loss of revenues  some permanent repairs to damaged properties have been deferred during the florida high season  which generally lasts from late december through early april  in order to have facilities available to meet demand 
these damaged facilities will be removed from service for permanent repairs at a later date 
we have hired consultants to assess our business interruption claims and are currently negotiating with our insurance carriers regarding coverage for income losses sustained 
to the extent that we are entitled to a recovery under the insurance policies  we will recognize a receivable when it can be demonstrated that it is probable that such insurance recovery will be realized  and such receivable will then be reflected as a component of operating income 
any gain resulting from business interruption insurance for lost income will not be recognized until the relevant payments have been received and all contingencies related to the insurance recoveries are resolved 
this income recognition criteria will result in business interruption insurance recoveries being recorded in a period subsequent to the period that we experience lost income from the affected properties  resulting in fluctuations in our net income that may reduce the comparability of reported quarterly results for some periods into the future 
under this income recognition criteria  as of december   we have recorded a million insurance claim receivable related to both property damage and business interruption recoveries combined  of 
table of contents which million in insurance advances had been collected through december  we have collected an additional million in advances from january through march  of the million receivable recorded  million represents the write down of net fixed assets  as discussed above 
the remaining million represents a probable recovery of costs incurred 
the cost recoveries are recorded on the expense line item to which they relate  therefore there is no net impact to any line item or our results 
the following is a summary of hurricane related activity recorded in millions hurricane receivable december  fixed assets net book value write down recovery of costs incurred payments received to date during the fourth quarter and full year  the nine hotels that have been closed or substantially closed realized million and million  respectively  in revenues 
we recognized million of revenues on these hotels during the fourth quarter of  and million of revenues during the full year overall results revenues from continuing operations increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
the revenues increase is primarily due to our acquisition of two hotels in and the result of a increase in adr at our comparable hotels see results of operations for definition of comparable hotels  partially offset by a disruption of revenues at properties impacted by the hurricanes 
net loss for the year ended december  includes hotel and other operating expenses that are higher compared to prior year  mainly due to the short term impact and one time costs associated with hotel renovations and brand conversions during  the impact in of aggressive cost cutting initiatives that were implemented in early in anticipation of economic impacts associated with the war in iraq and associated tensions  and a reversal in of certain cost reductions  particularly in areas having the most impact on guest satisfaction such as concierge  lounge  restaurant and lounge hours and front desk and bell stand staffing 
in addition  we incurred a million loss on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended december   as compared to a million gain on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended december  our december  results include the impact of a million adjustment to our previous accounting for profits only op units pops equity based compensation awards 
although the adjustment is not material to our financial results taken as a whole  because this adjustment is a one time compensation expense reduction  our compensation expense is not fully comparable to our compensation expense 
this adjustment is recorded in the general and administrative  corporate line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
had the current accounting been applied originally  our net loss would have been million for the year ended december  see note to the financial statements 
results of operations our revenues are derived from the operations of our hospitality properties  including room  food and beverage revenues  as well as from our leases of office  retail and parking rentals 
included in our operating income but not in revenues is our cumulative preferred return on our partnership interest in mip  the interest income on our mezzanine loan to the radisson lexington avenue hotel and our equity in the income on our

our expenses also include interest on our debt  amortization of related debt issuance costs and minority interest allocations  which represent the allocation of income and losses to outside investors for properties that are not wholly owned 
the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
require that current and prior period operating results of any asset that has been classified as held for sale or has been disposed of on or after january   including any gain or loss recognized on the sale  be recorded as discontinued operations 
accordingly  we have reclassified all prior periods presented to comply with this requirement

table of contents year ended december  compared with the year ended december  continuing operations results our properties in continuing operations include two properties acquired in  two properties of which we intend to dispose  and nine properties in florida that were most significantly impacted by a series of four hurricanes in august and september operating results have been impacted by these events 
for more information regarding the impact of these hurricanes  see results overview 
in order to provide a useful comparison  where appropriate  this section includes discussion and analysis of our results as a whole and discussion and analysis of results of the comparable hotels that were in normal operations for the current period and the prior year period 
the nine florida hotels impacted by the hurricanes  two hotels of which we intend to dispose  and the two acquired hotels are excluded 
the following table presents operating data for our comparable hotels percent change operating data adr occupancy revpar total revenue 
total revenue increased by million or in compared to  primarily due to a million increase to million in room revenue directly attributable to an increase in adr  combined with a million increase in food revenue 
adr increased for the year ended december  when compared with the same period in due to our two acquired properties as well as the result of the industry benefiting from an increase in travel due to a general strengthening of the economy  partially offset by revenue losses from our hurricane impacted hotels 
the decrease in occupancy of over the same period was due to rooms out of service as a result of the florida hurricanes  the impact of having less available rooms due to hotel room renovations  as well as a focus on increasing daily rates  which resulted in lower group  contract  and internet sales

for the comparable hotels  rooms expense increased by from million in to million in with a slight decrease in margin of when comparing room revenue to rooms expense  mainly due to the impact of renovation related costs

impairments were significant during due to our decision during the year to expand our asset disposition program  thereby resulting in a change in our expected holding period for these assets 
impairment charges were lower in  as we did not add a significant number of properties to our disposition program

table of contents funds from operations ffo substantially all of our non current assets consist of real estate  and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  those assets are subject to straight line depreciation  which reflects the assumption that the value of real estate assets  other than land  will decline ratably over time 
that assumption is often not true with respect to the actual market values of real estate assets and  in particular  hotels  which fluctuate based on economic  market and other conditions 
as a result  management and many industry investors believe the presentation of gaap operating measures for real estate companies to be more informative and useful when other measures  adjusted for depreciation and amortization  are also presented 
in an effort to address these concerns  the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  adopted a definition of funds from operations  or ffo  which we have also adopted 
nareit defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate  real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after comparable adjustments for our portion of these items related to unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
extraordinary items and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle as defined by gaap are also excluded from the calculation of ffo 
as defined by nareit  ffo also does not include reductions from asset impairment charges 
the securities and exchange commission  however  has recommended that ffo include the effect of asset impairment charges  which is the presentation we have adopted for all historical presentations of ffo 
we believe ffo is an indicative measure of our operating performance due to the significance of our hotel real estate assets and provides beneficial information to investors 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to any other performance measures prescribed by gaap 
although ffo is considered a standard benchmark utilized by the investment community  our ffo may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure reported by other companies 
ffo we use ffo as a measure of our performance

our principal uses of cash include the funding of working capital obligations  debt service  debt repurchases  investments in hotels including capital projects and acquisitions  and escrow requirements 
our debt strategy includes considering opportunities to repay debt and to reduce our overall cost of borrowing  such as through low interest rate mortgages and interest rate swaps 
we believe we currently have sufficient cash on hand  and we expect to have adequate cash flow during the next twelve months in order to fund our operations  capital commitments and debt service obligations 
we did not pay a dividend on our common stock during  nor do we expect to pay one in our current and future liquidity is  however  greatly dependent upon our operating results  which are driven largely by overall economic conditions  and since september  have been significantly affected by geopolitical concerns and other factors affecting business and leisure travel 
if general economic conditions are significantly worse than we expect for an extended period  this will likely have a negative effect on our projections of available cash flow and liquidity 
factors that may influence our liquidity include factors that affect our results of operations  including general economic conditions  demand for business and leisure travel  public concerns about travel safety related primarily to terrorism and related concerns  capital investments required to maintain our property s competitive position  insurance coverage and timing of hurricane related expenditures and related insurance receipts  and other operating risks described under the caption  risk factors operating risks in item of this annual report on form k  factors that affect our access to bank financing and the capital markets  including operational risks  high leverage  covenant compliance  interest rate fluctuations  and other risks described under the caption risk factors financing risks in item of this annual report on form k  and

we generally intend to hold unrestricted cash balances of million to million in our operating accounts as a hedge against economic and geopolitical uncertainties  as well as to provide for our recurring cash requirements 
we established a million secured revolving bank line in december  maturing in december  which is fully available and increases our flexibility in managing our liquidity 
on april   we raised proceeds through the issuance and sale of million shares of common stock at a price to the public of per share pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement filed under the securities act of the offering closed on april  with net proceeds of approximately million 
this equity issuance enabled us to raise cash with a deployment strategy to acquire assets with strong brand affiliations and higher growth rate potential in strong markets 
during the year ended december   we disposed of primarily underperforming assets with  rooms for million in cash and million in reduction of debt 
these assets were largely upscale and midscale assets that do not fit with our upper upscale focus  were located in markets that are not strategically important to us or where we have multiple assets  had significant capital expenditure needs or produced insufficient cash flow or have lower growth opportunities 
proceeds were used to upgrade the existing portfolio through our asset renovation program or acquisition strategy  or to redeem debt 
on may  we acquired the four star  four diamond rated ritz carlton  pentagon city in arlington  virginia for a purchase price of million 
the room luxury hotel is operated by the ritz carlton hotel company  llc under a long term contract

the investment was financed with cash on hand 
the loan is secured by a pledge of the equity interests held by the borrower in an indirect parent of the owner of the hotel  and has a year term 
the loan is subordinate to a million financial institution loan  but has priority over all equity interests 
our equity investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method of accounting  we recognized million of equity in the income of our investment during the fourth quarter and received distributions of million 
however  due to seasonality of the market  we expect that our equity in the income of the investment could be less in the first three quarters of each year as compared to the last quarter of the year 
this seasonality could also impact the timing of distributions received 
our investment in mip yielded a payment of million in december and million in february the payments were applied against our outstanding receivable balance 
see recent developments for further discussion 

table of contents during the year ended december   we invested approximately million in our existing assets through our aggressive asset renovation program for our assets 
we expect to invest a total of approximately million on capital expenditures in  including million to complete projects started in and excluding hurricane related capital expenditures 
the amount of hurricane related capital expenditures has not yet been fully determined  however  we anticipate it to well exceed million  most of which we expect to be reimbursed by our insurance carriers 
as part of our strategy to manage our leverage  we have retired debt with higher interest rates and acquired debt with lower interest rates 
during fiscal  we retired million of our senior subordinated notes plus million of accrued interest by issuing million shares of common stock 
in addition  we purchased from available cash million of our senior unsecured notes  including million of the notes  million of the notes and million of the notes 
following these exchanges and the repurchases  we had million of outstanding senior subordinated notes due and million of outstanding senior unsecured notes 
these transactions have allowed us to reduce our cost of borrowing and improve our credit statistics 
on january   we entered into a million mortgage loan on our hilton crystal city hotel that bears interest at a fixed rate of 
the mortgage requires interest payments only for the first three years and then monthly payments of interest and principal over the remaining portion of the ten year term of the loan 
in august and september  a number of our hotels located in florida incurred substantial damage and business interruption 
while we have comprehensive insurance coverage for both property damage and business interruption  we are experiencing a decline in revenues due to the full or partial closure of certain hotels  and we will not be able to recognize any income from business interruption insurance or gains on replacement of damaged property until all contingencies related to the insurance payments have been resolved 
additionally  we may experience a timing delay between cash outflows and cash inflows  as we may incur costs to rebuild the damaged properties  and temporary negative cash flows associated with affected properties  that may not be reimbursed by the insurance carriers for several periods 
additionally  we are liable for any policy deductibles 
while this timing difference may have some impact on our short term liquidity  we believe that we will be able to meet all of our short term cash needs through a variety of means  including reducing capital expenditures  borrowings under our credit facility and the placement of mortgages  if necessary 
for more information regarding the impact of these hurricanes  see results overview 
as of december   we had million of cash held in escrow  which was required by certain debt agreements and the interest rate swap agreement 
our cash balance held in escrow may increase or decrease based upon the performance of our encumbered hotels  our ability to obtain timely capital reimbursements  and the fair value of our interest rate swap

table of contents and while we are seeing the impacts of a recovering economy  our operating results have continued to be affected by the reduction in travel resulting from economic conditions  geopolitical events  war  the continued threat of domestic terrorism  and other factors affecting business and leisure travel 
cash flow from operations increased in primarily due to the impact of increased revenues due to the refocusing of our portfolio assets  as well as the generation of new revenues from our hotels acquired in  and as a result of the lodging industry economic recovery 
we used a net million of cash from investing activities during the year ended december   primarily due to million for acquisition of hotels  net of cash acquired  million in capital expenditures including million of capitalized interest  million for an investment in a hotel  million increase in cash restricted for mortgage escrows and our interest rate swap  and million in costs associated with our disposition program  partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of hotel assets

we must distribute to stockholders at least of our reit taxable income  excluding net capital gains  to preserve the favorable tax treatment accorded to reits under the internal revenue code 
under certain circumstances  we may be required to make distributions in excess of cash available for distribution in order to meet the internal revenue code requirements 
in that event  we would seek to borrow additional funds or sell additional non core assets for cash  or both  to the extent necessary to obtain cash sufficient to make the distributions required to retain our qualification as a reit 
any future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be determined by factors including our operating results  restrictions imposed by our borrowing agreements  capital expenditure requirements  the economic outlook  the distribution requirements for reits under the internal revenue code and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant 
our senior unsecured notes indenture permits the payment of dividends in order to maintain reit qualification if we fall below a to fixed charge coverage ratio 
however  our senior subordinated notes indenture is more restrictive in that it permits the payment of dividends only if we exceed the to fixed charge coverage ratio 
the timing and amount of any future distributions is dependent upon these factors  and we cannot provide assurance that any such distributions will be made in the future

table of contents as of december   of our debt bore fixed rates of interest  and the remaining bore interest at fixed rates that have been  since april   effectively swapped to a floating rate 
our overall weighted average interest rate was after giving effect to the interest rate swap 
based on market prices at december   the fair value of our long term debt was billion 
credit facility 
on december   we entered into a three year million senior credit facility  secured by six of our hotels  and terminated our previous credit facility 
the facility bears interest at an annual rate of the london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus basis points 
as of december  and  we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility 
the facility contains financial and other restrictive covenants 
our ability to borrow under this facility is subject to compliance with financial covenants  including leverage  fixed charge coverage and interest coverage ratios and minimum net worth requirements 
our compliance with these covenants in future periods will depend substantially upon the financial results of our hotels 
the agreement governing our senior credit facility limits our ability to effect mergers  asset sales and change of control events and limits the payments of dividends other than those required for us to maintain our status as a reit and our ability to incur additional secured and total indebtedness 
there are no ratings based covenants in the facility 
senior unsecured notes 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  using available cash  million of our senior unsecured notes  including million of the notes due  million of the notes due  and million of the notes due we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million and wrote off deferred financing costs of million related to these repurchases which is included in depreciation and amortization expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the senior unsecured notes are general  unsecured obligations of mhop  our principal operating subsidiary  and we and various subsidiaries of mhop guarantee payment of principal and interest on the notes 
these notes contain various restrictive covenants  limiting our ability to initiate or transact certain business activities if specific financial thresholds are not achieved 
one of those thresholds is having a to fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the indentures  fixed charges only include interest on debt obligations and preferred equity in order to enter into certain types of transactions  including the repurchase of our stock  the issuance of any preferred stock  the payment of certain dividends  the incurrence of any additional debt  or the repayment of certain outstanding debt before it comes due 
as of december   our fixed charge coverage ratio was significantly below to  and therefore we were not permitted generally to enter into those transactions  except as noted below 
there are certain exceptions with respect to the incurrence of additional debt and early repayment of debt features in the indentures 
we have the ability to incur up to million of secured financing within restricted subsidiaries  subject to meeting other maintenance tests under the indentures  of which million was available at december  we also have a general carve out to incur million of unspecified borrowings within a restricted subsidiary  of which the full amount was available at december  we have the ability to incur debt financing within an unrestricted subsidiary  such as the million mortgage financing related to the acquisition of marriott irvine 
additionally  we are permitted to repay subordinated debt prior to its maturity from the proceeds of an equal or junior financing with a longer term than the debt refinanced  an equity offering  or a financing within an unrestricted subsidiary 
secured facilities 
we completed a million non recourse financing secured by a portfolio of hotels in the loan bears a fixed annual interest rate of and matures in the secured facility contains standard provisions that require the servicer to maintain in escrow cash balances for certain items such as property taxes and insurance 
in addition  the facility contains a provision that requires our mortgage servicer to retain in escrow the excess cash from the encumbered hotels after payment of debt service excess cash  if net hotel operating income noi for the trailing twelve months declines below million 
this provision 
table of contents was triggered in october and will be effective until the hotels generate the minimum cash flow required for two consecutive quarters  at which time the cash being held in escrow will be released to us 
in july  we signed an amendment to the loan agreement that permits the release of cash placed in escrow for all capital expenditures incurred on the encumbered properties on or after april  although the servicer will continue to retain in escrow any excess cash from the encumbered hotels during the low noi period  they will release cash for all capital expenditures on the encumbered properties beginning april   subject to the servicer s review and approval 
as of december  and december   million and million  respectively  of cash was held in escrow under this provision 
escrowed funds totaling million were available to fund capital expenditures under this provision as of december  from january  through march   we have received cash reimbursements of million from the servicer related to capital expenditures incurred on the encumbered properties 
the fair value adjustments for the interest rate swap agreement of net million that are discussed in further detail below are related to the outstanding secured facility balance of million as of december  on september   as permitted by the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes and senior subordinated notes  we completed a million commercial mortgage backed securities financing  secured by a portfolio of four hotels 
the loan carries a fixed annual interest rate of and matures in we incurred approximately million in debt issuance costs related to the facility 
we placed this commercial mortgage backed security in order to reduce our average borrowing cost by paying down debt with higher interest rates 
convertible subordinated notes 
on july   we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due these notes are convertible into our common stock at any time prior to or at maturity at a conversion price of per share equal to a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes 
the proceeds from the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes were used to repurchase million of our million convertible notes due  at varying prices  resulting in an aggregate discount of approximately million 
these convertible notes were convertible into our common stock at a rate of shares per  in principal amount  which equaled approximately per share 
on october   the remaining million balance of convertible notes were repaid at maturity 
senior subordinated notes 
the senior subordinated notes are unsecured obligations due in  and provide for semi annual payments of interest each february and august at an annual rate of 
the related indenture contains various restrictive covenants  which are similar to those in our senior unsecured notes 
the senior subordinated notes are subject to redemption at our option 
under the indenture governing these notes  the redemption price for redemptions occurring through august  will be of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  and for redemptions occurring after august  the redemption price will be of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
during the year ended december   we retired million of our senior subordinated notes plus million of accrued interest through the issuance of  shares of common stock 
we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million and wrote off deferred financing costs of million related to this activity 
the write off of deferred financing costs is included in depreciation and amortization expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
this transaction allowed us to reduce our cost of borrowing and retire higher yielding  covenant restrictive debt  that could not have otherwise been repaid 
in february  we repurchased  using available cash  million of our senior subordinated notes 
mortgage and other debt 
as of december   we had three mortgage loans  two of which were obtained during the second quarter of the new mortgages obtained in allowed us to take advantage of the low current interest rate environment  reducing our overall cost of borrowing 

table of contents we financed a portion of the marriott irvine acquisition see asset acquisitions below with a million fixed rate mortgage loan effective june   which matures on july  and bears interest at an annual fixed rate of 
on june   in connection with the ritz carlton  pentagon city acquisition see asset acquisitions below  we entered into a million fixed rate mortgage loan  which matures on june  and bears interest at an annual fixed rate of 
we had a mortgage loan on a hotel property that was to mature in and carried an interest rate of  however  the lender  with our acquiescence  initiated foreclosure proceedings on the property which were completed on september   and we relinquished the property to the bank 
the carrying value of the mortgage loan and the fair value of the property both approximated million 
this property is included in discontinued operations 
our other individual mortgage matures in and carries a fixed interest rate of with an initial principal amount of million 
on january   we entered into a million mortgage loan on our hilton crystal city hotel that bears interest at a fixed rate of 
the mortgage requires interest payments only for the first three years and then monthly payments of interest and principal over the remaining portion of the ten year term of the loan 
derivatives 
on april   we entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with a third party to manage our interest rate risk related to our secured facility due  effectively converting the interest the facility bears from a fixed rate to a floating rate 
under the swap  we receive fixed rate payments of and pay floating rate payments based on a one month libor plus basis points on an initial million notional amount 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
due to the fact that the notional amount of the swap matches the principal amount of the underlying debt and other hedge accounting criteria were met  the swap was designated as highly effective at the inception of the swap arrangement and designated as a fair value hedge 
we continue to evaluate the effectiveness of the hedge and believe that the hedge continues to be highly effective 
for a derivative qualifying as a fair value hedge  the change in net unrealized gain or loss upon measuring the fair value hedge and the fair value of the debt instrument is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
these amounts offset each other as there was no ineffective portion and therefore had no impact on our net loss for the year ended december  the fair value of the swap is recorded as either an asset or liability  with a corresponding increase or decrease to the carrying value of the debt instrument being hedged on our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of our hedge was approximately a million liability as of december  this amount is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet in the other liabilities line item with a corresponding debit recorded to long term debt 
during the year ended december   we earned cash payments of million under the swap  which were recorded as a reduction in interest expense 
in conjunction with the interest rate swap  we have posted collateral of million as of december  the required collateral amount fluctuates based on the changes in the swap rate and the amount of time left to maturity 
during  our posted collateral ranged from million to million 
however  due to the terms of the swap agreement  our posted collateral must be a minimum amount calculated per the agreement  which was million as of december  we will receive all remaining collateral upon maturity of the swap 
during  our only derivative instruments consisted of two swap agreements that did not qualify for treatment as hedges under sfas no 
 which expired in april and july during the year ended december   we recognized million of income related to the decrease in fair value of the liability recorded for the interest rate swaps in place in that time period 
for the year ended december   we made cash payments on those swaps of million 
the change in fair value and the swap payments are netted together on our consolidated statement of operations  thus resulting in no impact on consolidated net loss 

table of contents during the year ended december   we recognized million of income related to the decrease in fair value of the liability recorded for the interest rate swaps in place in that time period 
for the year ended december   we made cash payments on those swaps of million

during the year ended december   we also recognized a million loss on the fair value of derivatives no longer providing a hedge due to the repayment of the hedged debt 
asset acquisitions during  we invested in three properties  each of them having exceptional quality and exhibiting superior growth potential  and being located in three of the top performing markets in the country 
we believe these factors will enable these investments to produce superior returns for our shareholders 
our two consolidated hotels  and while not consolidated into our results  the hotel for which we record equity in income  realized full year combined revpar of 
revpar for our entire portfolio during was 
the higher revpar of the acquired hotels is indicative of their overall earnings power 
on may  we acquired the four star  four diamond rated ritz carlton  pentagon city in arlington  virginia for a purchase price of million 
the room luxury hotel is operated by the ritz carlton hotel company  llc under a long term contract 
the hotel features nearly  square feet of meeting space  which can accommodate meetings of up to guests 
on june   we partially financed the acquisition through the placement of a million fixed rate mortgage loan  which is secured by this property 
the mortgage matures on june  and bears interest at an annual fixed rate of 
we financed the remainder of the acquisition cost with cash on hand 
additionally  on june   we acquired the room marriott irvine in orange county  california  for a purchase price of million 
the hotel is operated by a subsidiary of marriott international  inc under a long term contract 
the hotel features  square feet of meeting space  including a  square foot ballroom that can accommodate meetings of up to  guests 
to take advantage of the current low interest rate environment  we financed a portion of the acquisition with a million fixed rate mortgage  which is secured by this property  matures on july  and bears interest at an annual fixed rate of 
we financed the remainder of the acquisition cost with cash on hand 
on october   we acquired a interest in the room radisson lexington avenue hotel in midtown manhattan 
we made a total investment of million  which includes a million mezzanine loan that matures on october  and yields million of cumulative annual interest  and a million equity interest in the hotel 
the mezzanine loan is secured by a pledge of the equity interests held by the borrower in an indirect parent of the owner of the hotel  and has a year term 
the loan is subordinate to million in senior notes  but has priority over all equity interests 
we will continue to be highly selective with potential acquisitions  focusing primarily on larger properties located in major urban markets or high end resort destinations with high barriers to new competition  premium brand affiliations  significant meeting space and superior growth potential 
the terms of our senior note indentures may limit our ability to obtain financing to acquire assets beyond certain limited exceptions including up to million of mortgage indebtedness  of which million was available at december   and million of general indebtedness as we are below the required fixed charge coverage ratio of to  at which level we would be permitted to generally incur debt without restriction 
asset dispositions we have substantially completed our previously announced disposition program that repositioned our portfolio into one generally consisting of larger assets with significant meeting space in urban or high end resort locations 
between january  and december   we disposed of hotels with  rooms for total 
table of contents gross proceeds of million in cash and million in reduction of debt 
of these hotels  hotels were disposed of in and hotels were disposed of in the reshaping of our portfolio has contributed to an increase in revpar  which  for our entire portfolio of properties excludes nine properties affected by hurricanes in  increased to from for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  we may from time to time receive offers on other assets that we might consider selling 
we would consider any opportunities that have the potential to improve our financial condition or results of operations 
capital expenditures we have developed a targeted renovation program that is designed to reduce the time and cost required to renovate hotels  allowing us to improve the quality of our hotels faster to take advantage of the rebound in the economy and better control the level of disruption associated with renovations 
during the year  we accelerated our renovation program for certain key assets  which created some short term disruption  but also positioned us to participate more quickly in the lodging industry recovery 
we make ongoing capital expenditures in order to keep our hotels competitive in their markets and to comply with franchise obligations  as described further in operating risks the potential adverse impact of our failure to meet the requirements contained in our franchise and licensing agreements included in item risk factors of this annual report on form k 
additionally  certain of our hotels management contracts and franchise agreements contain reserve requirements for property improvements 
we fund our capital expenditures primarily from cash generated from operations and existing cash on hand and intend to use a portion of the proceeds from the sales of assets to provide capital for renovation work 
we initiated an aggressive renovation program for our assets in the beginning of  and invested a total of million on capital expenditures in we anticipate investing a total of approximately million in  including million to complete projects started in and excluding hurricane related capital expenditures 
the emphasis is on completing these projects on budget with minimal disruptions to operations 
we focus on complete room and facility renovations  eliminating to the degree possible  piecemeal work where the typical consumer might not ascribe value to the improvements 
we believe we are timing this work appropriately to take full advantage of the economic recovery 
the amount of hurricane related capital expenditures has not yet been fully determined  however  we anticipate it to well exceed million  most of which we expect to be reimbursed by our insurance carriers 
other financial information critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries 
preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the impairment of long lived assets and the recording of certain accrued liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
some of our estimates are material to the financial statements 
these estimates are therefore particularly sensitive as future events could cause the actual results to be significantly different from our estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets we are required by gaap to perform an analysis to determine the recoverability of an asset s carrying value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a long lived asset may be impaired 
we make 
table of contents estimates of the undiscounted cash flows from the expected future operations or potential sale of the asset using the best information available at that time 
if our analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from these estimates of cash flows  we write down the asset to estimated fair value and recognize an impairment loss 
in conducting these analyses  we may also make assumptions about the asset s expected useful life  future capital expenditures  and fair market value 
due to future changes in market or economic conditions and our continuing forecast and outlooks for future periods  we may need to revise our estimates of fair value and recognize additional impairment charges in future periods if circumstances indicate at that time that the carrying value of the assets may be impaired 
in the past  market conditions have changed  causing additional impairment to be recognized due to a reduction in estimated sales price of our assets stemming from market forces 
we apply the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
hotels of which we dispose may be managed under agreements that require payments to the hotel management company as a result of termination 
any such liability will be recognized at the time the asset disposition is complete and a termination notice is provided to the hotel management company 
at that time  the recognition of the termination obligation will be included in the calculation of the final gain or loss on sale and will be included in discontinued operations 
classification of properties as held for sale our hotel properties generally fall into two categories  held for use and held for sale 
our held for use properties may include those that we are actively marketing 
until such time as our criteria for held for sale are met  as described below in further detail  we maintain classification as an operational asset 
at the time we determine an asset to meet the criteria noted below  we reclassify the asset and its operations to discontinued operations 
held for sale classification requires that the sale be probable and that the transfer of the asset is expected to be completed within one year  among other criteria 
assessing the probability of the sale requires significant judgment due to the uncertainty surrounding completing the transaction  and as a result  we have the following policy in aiding in assessing probability 
we classify the properties we are actively marketing as held for sale once all of these conditions are met our board has approved the sale  we have a fully executed agreement with a qualified buyer which provides for no significant outstanding or continuing obligations with the property after sale  and we have a significant non refundable deposit 
we carry properties held for sale at the lower of their carrying values or estimated fair values less costs to sell 
if our estimates of fair value are incorrect  the carrying values may not be accurately reflected 
we cease depreciation at the time the asset is classified as held for sale 
if material to our total portfolio  we segregate the assets and liabilities relating to our held for sale properties on our consolidated balance sheet 
we also reclassify the operating results of properties held for sale as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
depreciation and amortization expense we estimate the useful lives of property and equipment in order to determine the amount of depreciation and amortization expense to be recorded during any reporting period 
we depreciate the majority of our buildings and improvements over an estimated useful life of to years  or the remaining terms of a ground lease  if shorter 
we depreciate furniture  fixtures and equipment over lives ranging from five to seven years  and computers over three to five years 
the estimated useful lives are based on our historical experience with similar assets  as well as our taking into account current market and economic conditions 
while management believes its estimates are reasonable  a change in the estimated lives would affect depreciation expense and net income  as well as the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels 

table of contents hurricane related insurance recoveries we have comprehensive insurance coverage for both property damage and business interruption relating to the properties affected by the august and september hurricanes 
our damage assessment teams  working with the adjusters for our insurance providers  are inspecting each of our affected properties and implementing restoration plans 
the net book value of the property damage is currently estimated to be at least million  however  we are still assessing the impact of the hurricanes on our properties  and actual net book value write offs could vary from this estimate 
changes to this estimate will be recorded in the periods in which they are determined 
for the year ended december   we have recorded a net fixed asset write off and a corresponding insurance claim receivable for this million net book value amount because we believe that it is probable that the insurance recovery  net of deductibles  will significantly exceed the net book value of the damaged portion of these assets 
the recovery is based on replacement cost  and we have submitted claims substantially in excess of million 
while we expect the insurance proceeds will be sufficient to cover most of the replacement cost of the restoration of these hotels  certain deductibles primarily windstorm and limitations will apply 
moreover  no determination has been made as to the total amount or timing of those insurance payments  and those insurance payments may not be sufficient to cover the costs of all the restoration of the hotels 
to the extent that insurance proceeds  which are on a replacement cost basis  ultimately exceed the net book value of the damaged property  a gain will be recorded in the period when all contingencies related to the insurance claim have been resolved 
as a result of the damage caused by the hurricanes  our properties experienced varying periods of business interruption and impacts on operations  including closure of certain hotels 
where possible and in order to mitigate loss of revenues  some permanent repairs to damaged properties have been deferred during the florida high season  which generally lasts from late december through early april  in order to have facilities available to meet demand 
these damaged facilities will be removed from service for permanent repairs at a later date 
we have hired consultants to assess our business interruption claims and are currently negotiating with our insurance carriers regarding coverage for income losses sustained 
to the extent that we are entitled to a recovery under the insurance policies  we will recognize a receivable when it can be demonstrated that it is probable that such insurance recovery will be realized  and such receivable will then be reflected as a component of operating income 
any gain resulting from business interruption insurance for lost income will not be recognized until the relevant payments have been received and all contingencies related to the insurance recoveries are resolved 
this income recognition criteria will result in business interruption insurance recoveries being recorded in a period subsequent to the period that we experience lost income from the affected properties  resulting in fluctuations in our net income that may reduce the comparability of reported quarterly results for some periods into the future 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which requires companies to recognize compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  and measure that cost based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
we are required to comply with the provisions of this statement beginning with the third quarter of we do not expect the adoption of this revised standard to have a material effect on our accounting treatment for share based payments  as we adopted the transition provisions of sfas no

 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions in december this statement amends opinion to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
we are required to comply with the provisions of this statement for the third quarter of we have not entered into or modified any transactions within the scope of this standard  nor do we have any existing transactions that fall within the scope of sfas no 
eitf issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share provides guidance that contingently convertible debt instruments are convertible debt  and should be included in diluted earnings per share computations if dilutive regardless of whether the market price trigger or other contingent feature has been met 
we are required to comply with the provisions of this statement for the year ended december  we have not entered into or modified any transactions within the scope of this standard  nor do we have any existing transactions that fall within the scope of this eitf 
while our outstanding convertible subordinated notes as of december  are convertible into common stock  their conversion is not contingent upon any future event 
therefore  they have always been reviewed for diluted earnings per share effects  and this eitf has no impact 
off balance sheet arrangements we have future ground lease obligations related to our consolidated entities and properties 
the ground leases are accounted for as operating leases  and are expensed evenly over the lives of the leases 
these leases exist at properties where we do not own the land associated with our hotel 
as of december   other than our equity method investment  we were not involved in any off balance sheet arrangements 
aggregate contractual obligations the following table summarizes our aggregate contractual obligations as of december  in thousands total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years long term debt obligations a operating lease obligations b purchase obligations c termination fees d fixed interest payments e aggregate contractual obligations a the amounts shown include amortization of principal and maturities on our debt as well as discounts of million on our senior notes 
for a description of the material terms of our long term debt  see financial condition  liquidity and capital resources long term debt section above 
b includes ground and building operating types of leases 
the amounts shown are net of million of sublease receipts 
c our purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures at our hotels  which include million in hurricane related commitments most of which we expect to be reimbursed by our insurance carriers and million in non hurricane related commitments 
under our contracts  we have the ability to defer some of these expenditures into later years and some of the current year amount reflects prior year contracts that were deferred or not completed 
d termination fees related to the sale of our hotels  see the management agreements interstate hotels 
e represents fixed interest payments on our debt 
the managers operate our hotels pursuant to management agreements with our taxable subsidiaries 
under these management agreements  the taxable subsidiaries pay a management fee for each property to the manager of their hotels 
the taxable subsidiaries in turn make rental payments to our subsidiary operating partnership under the participating leases 

table of contents under the interstate hotels management agreements  the base management fee is of total hotel revenue  plus incentive payments based on meeting performance thresholds that could total up to an additional of total hotel revenue

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our interest rate risk management objective is to manage the effect of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
we look to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
to achieve our objectives  we may borrow at a combination of fixed and variable rates  and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we only enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for hedging purposes  and not for trading purposes 
we do not engage in speculative transactions 
on april   we entered into an interest rate swap on our secured facility due  effectively converting the interest the facility bears from a fixed rate to a floating rate 
under the swap  we receive fixed rate payments of and pay floating rate payments based on a one month libor plus basis points on an initial million notional amount 
we have designated the interest rate swap as a fair value hedge for financial reporting purposes and the amounts paid or received under the swap agreement will be recognized over the life of the agreement as an adjustment to interest expense 
changes in the fair value of the swap and the secured facilities are reflected in the balance sheet as offsetting changes and have no income statement effect 
the fair value of the interest rate swap at december  was a liability of approximately million  which is included in the other liabilities line item on our consolidated balance sheet 
in conjunction with the interest rate swap  we have posted collateral of million as of december  the required collateral amount fluctuates based on the changes in the swap rate and the amount of time left to maturity 
during  our posted collateral ranged from million to million 
however  due to the terms of the swap agreement  our posted collateral must be a minimum amount calculated per the agreement  which was million as of december  we will receive all remaining collateral upon maturity of the swap 
the table below provides information about our derivative financial instrument that is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates for our interest rate swap 
weighted average interest rates and notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
weighted average interest rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve as of december  the interest rate swap that we have entered into is strictly to hedge interest rate risk and not for trading purposes 
expected payment date in millions total fair value as of interest rate derivative interest rate swap fixed to variable average pay rate average receive rate as a result of our interest rate swap  we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates 
in the future  we intend to manage our interest rate exposure using a mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt 
a change in one month libor of basis points would result in an increase or decrease in current annual interest expense of approximately million 

table of contents as of december   approximately of our outstanding debt bears fixed rates of interest that have been effectively swapped from a fixed rate to a floating rate  with the remaining of debt bearing fixed rates of interest 
before the effect of the swap  all of our debt bears fixed rates of interest as follows in millions expected maturity fixed rate average interest rate thereafter total fair value adjustment for interest rate swap fair value at of total debt exchange rate risk as of december   we had no foreign operations 
we had previously owned four canadian hotels  but our last property in canada was sold in our canadian operations were not material to our consolidated financial position as of december  and  or our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended december  accordingly  we were not subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on our future cash flows we would receive from our foreign subsidiaries 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the same periods 
additionally  we did not enter into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
