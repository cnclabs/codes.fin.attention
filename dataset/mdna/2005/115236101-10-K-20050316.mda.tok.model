item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
we are a general insurance agency and brokerage headquartered in daytona beach and tampa  florida 
since  our stated corporate objective has been to increase our net income per share by at least every year 
we have increased revenues from million in as originally stated  without giving effect to any subsequent acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting to million in  a compound annual growth rate of 
in the same period  we increased net income from million as originally stated  without giving effect to any subsequent acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting to million in  a compound annual growth rate of 
we have also increased net income per share or more for consecutive years  excluding the effect of a one time investment gain of million in and favorable adjustments to our income tax reserves of million in and million in  respectively 
since  excluding the historical impact of poolings  our pre tax margins income before income taxes and minority interest improved in all but one year  and in that year  the pre tax margin was essentially flat 
these improvements have resulted primarily from net new business growth new business production offset by lost business  acquisitions and continued operating efficiencies 
our revenue growth in was driven by i net new business growth  ii the acquisition of agency entities and several books of business customer accounts  with total annualized revenues of approximately million  and iii flat to a slight decrease in premium rates in certain lines of business 
our commissions and fees revenue are comprised of commissions paid by insurance companies and fees paid directly by customers 
commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by the insured and are materially affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds underlying insurable exposure units  which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values  sales and payroll levels so as to determine what premium to charge the insured 
these premium rates are established by insurance companies based upon many factors  including reinsurance rates  none of which we control 
beginning in and continuing through  commission revenues were adversely influenced by a consistent decline in premium rates resulting from intense competition among property and casualty insurance companies for market share 
among other factors  this condition of a prevailing decline in premium rates  commonly referred to as a soft market  generally resulted in flat to reduced commissions on renewal business 
the effect of this softness in rates on our commission revenues was somewhat offset by our acquisitions and net new business production 
as a result of increasing loss ratios the comparison of incurred losses plus adjustment expense against earned premiums of insurance companies through  there was a general increase in premium rates beginning in the first quarter of and continuing into during  the increases in premium rates began to moderate  and in certain lines of insurance  the premium rates decreased 
we expect the softening of insurance premium rates to continue through the volume of business from new and existing customers  fluctuations in insurable exposure units and changes in general economic and competitive conditions further impact our revenues 
for example  the increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards have caused some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage 
conversely  level rates of inflation and the general decline of economic activity in recent years have limited the increases in the values of insurable exposure units 
still  our revenues continue to grow as a result of an intense focus on net new business growth and acquisitions 
we anticipate that results of operations will continue to be influenced by these competitive and economic conditions in we also earn contingent commissions  which are profit sharing commissions based primarily on underwriting results  but may also contain considerations for volume  growth and or retention 
these commissions are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each year and  over the last three years  have averaged approximately of the previous year s total commissions and fees revenue 
contingent commissions are included in our total commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of income in the year received 
the term core commissions and fees excludes contingent commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold  and specific fee based services rendered 
fee revenues are generated primarily by our services division  which provides insurance related services  including third party administration  consulting for the workers compensation and employee benefit self insurance markets  and managed healthcare services 
in each of the past three years  fee revenues generated by the services division have declined as a percentage of our total commissions and fees  from in to in this declining trend is anticipated to continue as the revenues from our other reportable segments grow at a faster pace 
investment income consists primarily of interest earnings on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies 
our policy is to invest available funds in high quality  short term fixed income investment securities 
investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments 
acquisitions during  brown brown acquired the assets of general insurance agencies  several books of business customer accounts and the outstanding stock of three general insurance agencies 
the aggregate purchase price was million  including million of net cash payments  the issuance of million in notes payable and the assumption of million of liabilities 
these acquisitions had estimated aggregate annualized revenues of million 
during  we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of general insurance agencies  as well as the remaining minority interest in florida intracoastal underwriters  and several books of business customer accounts 
these acquisitions had estimated aggregate annualized revenues of million 
during  we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of general insurance agencies  several books of business customer accounts and the outstanding stock of six general insurance agencies 
these acquisitions had estimated aggregate annualized revenues of million 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we continually evaluate our estimates  which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities  which values are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that  of our significant accounting policies see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following critical accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition commission revenues are recognized as of the effective date of the insurance policy or the date the customer is billed  whichever is later 
at that date  the earnings process has been completed  and we can reliably estimate the impact of policy cancellations for refunds and establish reserves accordingly 
management determines the policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted by known circumstances 
subsequent commission adjustments are recognized upon notification from the insurance companies 
contingent commissions from insurance companies are recognized when determin able  which is when such commissions are received 
fee revenues are recognized as services are rendered 
business acquisitions and purchase price allocations we have significant intangible assets that were acquired through business acquisitions 
these assets consist of purchased customer accounts  noncompete agreements  and the excess of costs over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired goodwill 
the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of the purchase price to the intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  all of our business combinations initiated after june  have been accounted for using the purchase method 
in connection with these acquisitions  we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased  which typically consist of purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements 
purchased customer accounts include the physical records and files obtained from acquired businesses that contain information about insurance policies  customers and other matters essential to policy renewals  but it primarily represents the present value of the underlying cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future renewal periods of those purchased customer accounts 
the valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency  expenses and discount rates 
any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts 
noncompete agreements are valued based on the duration and any unique features of each specific agreement 
purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements are amortized on a straight line basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods  which range from five to years 
the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is no longer amortized in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

intangible assets impairment effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to lower of cost or market impairment testing 
sfas no 
requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
fair value is estimated based on multiples of revenues  earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  and pre tax income 
management assesses the recoverability of our goodwill on an annual basis  and amortizable intangibles and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the following factors  if present  may trigger an impairment review i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  ii significant negative industry or economic trends  iii significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and iv significant decline in our market capitalization 
if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above referenced factors  an impairment analysis is performed 
management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we maybe required to revise the assessment and  if appropriate  record an impairment charge 
we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november  and identified no impairment as a result of the evaluation 
reserves for litigation we are subject to numerous litigation claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable  an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
professional fees related to these claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
management  with the assistance of outside counsel  determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss based upon analysis of individual issues 
new developments or changes in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters may significantly affect the required reserves and impact our net income 
derivative instruments in  we entered into one derivative financial instrument an interest rate exchange agreement  or swap to manage the exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our million variable rate debt 
as of december   we maintained this swap agreement  whereby we pay a fixed rate on the notional amount to a bank and the bank pays us a variable rate on the notional amount equal to a base london interbank offering rate libor 
we have assessed this derivative as a highly effective cash flow hedge  and accordingly  changes in the fair market value of the swap are reflected in other comprehensive income 
the fair market value of this instrument is determined by quotes obtained from the related counter parties in combination with a valuation model utilizing discounted cash flows 
the valuation of this derivative instrument is a significant estimate that is largely affected by changes in interest rates 
if interest rates increase or decrease  the value of this instrument will change accordingly 
new accounting pronouncements see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effects of the adoption of new accounting standards 
results of operations for the years ended december   and the following discussion and analysis regarding results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
commissions and fees commissions and fees increased in  in and in core commissions and fees increased in  in and in  when excluding commissions and fees generated from acquired operations and also divested operations 
the results reflect the moderation of the premium rate growth during the year as compared with the slightly higher premium growth rates in  and the high premium growth rate of the hard market 
the results reflect the strong premium rate increases that began in the first quarter of and continued through investment income investment income increased to million in  compared with million in and million in the increase in was primarily a result of slightly higher investment yields earned during the year along with much higher available cash balances principally due to the funding of the million of unsecured senior notes in july and september of the decrease in was primarily a result of lower investment yields earned during the year along with lower available cash balances 
other income  net other income consists primarily of gains and losses from the sale and disposition of assets 
in  gains of million were recognized from the sale of customer accounts 
although we are not in the business of selling customer accounts  we periodically will sell an office or a book of business that does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for growth 
for these reasons  in  we sold all four of our retail offices in north dakota and our sole remaining operation in the medical third party administration services business 
gains from the sale of customer accounts were million in and million in employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits increased approximately in  in and in  primarily as a result of acquisitions and an increase in commissions paid on net new business 
employee compensation and benefits as a percentage of total revenues was in  in and in  reflecting a gradual improvement in personnel efficiencies as revenues grow 
we had  full time equivalent employees at december   compared with  at december  and  at december  non cash stock grant compensation non cash stock grant compensation expense represents the expense required to be recorded under accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  relating to our stock performance plan  which is more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the annual cost of this stock performance plan increases only when our average stock price over a trading day period increases by increments of or more from the price at the time of the original grant  or when additional shares are granted and the stock price increases 
since the first vesting condition for performance stock grants issued in was satisfied in when a trading day average stock price of was reached  we issued another significant set of performance stock grants in january at a grant price per share of 
there will be no expense relating to this set of performance stock grants until the trading day average stock price exceeds the performance stock grant price by an increment of 
additionally  other grants are periodically issued to new and existing employees 
during  the average stock price exceeded the average price for a trading day period required for the first of the shares granted in january to be awarded  and therefore we began the annual expensing of such shares 
as a result  the expense increased to million from million in during  since the average price of our stock never exceeded any of the thresholds of the grants priced at per share  the only expense related to our stock performance plan was the annual expense of grants issued prior to  which was then partially offset by expense credits resulting from forfeitures 
as a result  the expense decreased to million from million in as a result of the stock price increase in  the stock grants began to be expensed in  and the expense increased to million from million in in  million of the million was expensed due to the accelerated vesting of some performance stock grants as a result of the deaths of two employees 
other operating expenses other operating expenses increased in  in  and in  however  other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to in from in and in the continuing decline in other operating expenses  expressed as a percentage of total revenues  is attributable to the effective cost containment measures brought about by an initiative designed to identify areas of excess expense and to the fact that  in a net internal revenue growth environment  certain significant other operating expenses such as office rent  office supplies  data processing  and telephone costs  increase at a slower rate than commissions and fees revenue increase during the same period 
somewhat offsetting these cost efficiencies  our incurred accounting  legal and professional fees have increased approximately million in over the levels due to the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of and various ongoing investigations of agent and broker compensation  including contingent commissions  by state regulators 
also during  we expensed an additional million for various state and local use taxes 
offsetting these additional expenses was approximately million in reductions to our litigation and claims reserve 
amortization amortization expense increased million  or in  increased million  or in  and decreased million  or in the increases in and were due to the amortization of additional intangible assets as a result of new acquisitions 
as part of our annual impairment assessment as of november   management determined that the maximum amortization period for the intangible asset  purchased customer accounts  should be reduced from years to years 
a change in accounting estimate was recognized to reflect this decision  resulting in an increase in the amortization expense of  a decrease in net income of  and no impact on earnings per share 
future annual amortization expenses will increase by approximately million as a result of this change in accounting estimate 
the decrease in was primarily due to the elimination of goodwill amortization in accordance with sfas no 
 but was offset by the increased amortization of identifiable intangible assets from new acquisitions consummated in depreciation depreciation increased in  in and in these increases were primarily due to the purchase of new computer and related equipment  and the depreciation associated with new agency acquisitions 
interest expense interest expense increased million  or  in as a result of the funding of million of unsecured senior notes in the third quarter of interest expense decreased in by million  or  and million  or  in as a result of reductions in our outstanding debt 
income taxes the effective tax rate on income from operations was in  in and in the higher effective tax rate in  compared with and  was primarily the result of increased amounts of business conducted in states having higher state tax rates 
results of operations segment information as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we operate in four reportable segments the retail  national programs  brokerage and service divisions 
on a divisional basis  increases in amortization  depreciation and interest expenses are the result of new acquisitions in that division in a particular year 
likewise  other income in each division primarily reflects net gains on sales of customer accounts and fixed assets 
additionally  increases in non cash stock grant compensation is more dependent on increases in the company s average stock price than on the divisional results 
as such  in evaluating the operational efficiency of a division  management places greater emphasis on the net internal growth rate of core commissions and fees revenue  and the gradual improvement of the ratio of employee compensation and benefits to total revenues  and the gradual improvement of the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenues 
retail division the retail division provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial  public entity  professional and individual customers 
more than of the retail division s commissions and fees revenue are commission based 
since the majority of our operating expenses do not change as premiums fluctuate  we believe that most of any fluctuation in the commissions that we receive will be reflected in our pre tax income 
the retail division s commissions and fees revenue accounted for of our total consolidated commissions and fees revenue in but declined to in  mainly due to continued acquisitions in the national programs and brokerage divisions 
financial information relating to our retail division is as follows in thousands  except percentages percent percent change change revenues commissions and fees contingent commissions investment income other income  net total revenues expenses employee compensation and benefits non cash stock grant compensation other operating expenses amortization depreciation interest total expenses income before income taxes net internal growth rate core commissions and fees employee compensation and benefits ratio other operating expenses ratio capital expenditures total assets at december the retail division s total revenues in increased million to million  a increase over of this increase  approximately million related to commissions and fees from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in the remaining increase was primarily due to net new business growth 
during  we sold our four retail offices in north dakota and other books of businesses in various offices 
with respect to these assets sold during  million of commissions and fees revenue were earned in for which there were no revenues recognized in the comparable period 
therefore  the retail division s net internal growth rate in core commissions and fees revenue was in  excluding therevenues recognized in from new acquisitions and the commissions and fees from divested business 
the net internal growth rate of core commissions and fees revenue for the retail division in and was and  respectively 
the decline in the net internal growth rate from commissions and fees revenue from to primarily reflects the softening of insurance premium rates during that period 
income before income taxes in increased million to million  a increase over this increase was due to revenues from acquisitions  a positive internal growth rate and the continued focus on holding our general expense growth rate to a lower percentage than our revenue growth rate 
total revenues in increased million to million  a increase over of this increase  approximately million related to commissions and fees from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in the remaining increase was due to net new business growth and rising premium rates during the first half of during  we sold certain offices and books of businesses which earned approximately million in commissions and fees in for which there were no revenues recognized in the comparable period 
income before income taxes in increased million to million  a increase over this increase was due to revenues from acquisitions  increases in premium rates and improved cost structure related to those entities acquired during national programs division the national programs division is comprised of two units professional programs  which provides professional liability and related package products for certain professionals delivered through nationwide networks of independent agents  and special programs  which markets targeted products and services designated for specific industries  trade groups  public entities and market niches 
like the retail division  the national programs division s revenues are essentially all commission based 
financial information relating to our national programs division is as follows in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change revenues commissions and fees contingent commissions investment income other income loss  net total revenues expenses employee compensation and benefits non cash stock grant compensation other operating expenses amortization depreciation interest total expenses income before income taxes and minority interest net internal growth rate core commissions and fees employee compensation and benefits ratio other operating expenses ratio capital expenditures total assets at december total revenues in increased million to million  a increase over of this increase  approximately million related to commissions and fees from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in during  we discontinued several programs  including our professional medical program  which generated approximately million in revenues in but for which there were no comparable revenues in therefore  the national program division s internal growth rate for core commissions and fees was  excluding commissions and fees recognized in from new acquisitions and the commissions and fees from divested business 
the net internal growth rate for core commissions and fees for the national programs division in and  was and  respectively 
the decline in the internal growth rates from core commissions and fees from through was primarily related to declining insurance premium rates in our condominium program at our florida intracoastal underwriters fiu profit center 
the insurance rates in this program are expected to be up slightly in due to the impact of the hurricanes in income before income taxes and minority interest in increased million to million  a increase over  of which the majority related to the revenues derived from acquisitions completed in  but offset primarily by lower earnings at fiu 
the ratio of employee compensation and benefits to total revenues and the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenue were higher in than  primarily due to two reasons total revenues reflected million less profit sharing contingency income than in due primarily to the impact of the hurricanes in florida  and the and acquisitions reporting in this division accounted for of the division s total revenues  but operated only in the to operating profit margin range  thereby diluting the historical aggregate operating profit margin of this division 
total revenues in increased million to million  a increase over of this increase  approximately million was from calsurance associates  which was acquired in november  and several other agencies that were acquired that offer unique property and casualty insurance products designed for governmental agencies 
the remaining increase was primarily related to net new business growth 
in  the underwriting insurance company on our professional medical program opted not to renew this contract effective march and  without a replacement company  the revenues of this program dropped to million compared to million in in  this program ceased operations 
income before income taxes and minority interest in increased million to million  a increase over  of which the majority related to the revenues derived from the calsurance associates acquisition completed in brokerage division the brokerage division markets and sells excess and surplus commercial insurance and reinsurance  primarily through independent agents and brokers 
like the retail and national programs divisions  essentially all of the brokerage division s revenues are commission based 
financial information relating to our brokerage division is as follows in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change revenues commissions and fees contingent commissions investment income other income loss  net total revenues expenses employee compensation and benefits non cash stock grant compensation other operating expenses amortization depreciation interest total expenses income before income taxes net internal growth rate core commissions and fees employee compensation and benefits ratio other operating expenses ratio capital expenditures total assets at december total revenues in increased million to million  a increase over of this increase  approximately million related to commissions and fees from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in the brokerage division s internal growth rate for core commissions and fees in was  excluding commissions and fees recognized in from new acquisitions 
the net internal growth rate for core commissions and fees for the brokerage division in and  was and  respectively 
the decline in the internal growth rates from core commissions and fees in from was primarily related to the decline in the net new business generated by our reinsurance brokerage unit and the gradual softening of insurance premium rates 
the significantly higher internal growth rates in reflect the significant new business growth of our start up wholesale brokerage operations over the division s much smaller core revenue base in as a result of the brokerage division s net new business growth  income before income taxes in increased million to million  a increase over the ratio of employee compensation and benefits to total revenues and the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenue were higher in than  primarily due to two reasons total revenues reflected million less profit sharing contingency income than in  and during  we started several new branches of our peachtree special risk brokers unit and the start up salaries and operational costs diluted the division s normal operating profit margins 
total brokerage division revenues in increased million to million  a increase over of this increase  million related to commissions and fees from acquisitions for which there was no comparable revenue in the remaining increase is primarily due to net new business growth 
primarily as a result of the brokerage division s strong net new business growth  income before income taxes in increased million to million  a increase over services division the services division provides insurance related services  including third party administration  consulting for the workers compensation and employee benefit self insurance markets  and managed healthcare services 
unlike our other segments  approximately of the services division s commissions and fees revenue are generated from fees  which are not significantly affected by fluctuations in general insurance premiums 
financial information relating to our service division is as follows in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change revenues commissions and fees contingent commissions investment income other income loss  net total revenues expenses employee compensation and benefits non cash stock grant compensation other operating expenses amortization depreciation interest total expenses income before income taxes net internal growth rate core commissions and fees employee compensation and benefits ratio other operating expenses ratio capital expenditures total assets at december total revenues in decreased million to million  a decrease from of this decrease  approximately million related to commissions and fees from medical third party administration tpa business units sold in and these operations were sold because their respective operating profit margins were not expected to exceed the range  and as such  were not acceptable returns in our culture 
services division s internal growth rate for core commissions and fees was in  excluding the commissions and fees from divested business 
the net internal growth rate for core commissions and fees for the services division in and was and  respectively 
the positive internal growth rates from commissions and fees from through primarily reflect the strong net new business growth from our workers compensation and public risk tpa businesses 
income before income taxes in increased million to million  a increase over  primarily due to strong net new business growth and the elimination of the lower margin medical tpa businesses sold in and the services division s total revenues in increased million to million  a increase over the majority of the increase was the result of net new business growth 
income before income taxes in increased million to million  a increase over  primarily due to strong net new business growth and the elimination of the lower margin medical tpa business sold in quarterly operating results the following table sets forth our quarterly results for and in thousands  except per share data first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter total revenues income before income taxes net income net income per share basic diluted total revenues income before income taxes net income net income per share basic diluted liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents of million at december  reflected an increase of million over the million balance at december  during  million of cash was provided from operating activities  and million was provided from the issuance of new privately placed  unsecured senior notes 
also during this period  million of cash was used for acquisitions  million was used for additions to fixed assets  million was used for payments on long term debt and million was used for payment of dividends 
our cash and cash equivalents of million at december  reflected a decrease of million from our december  balance of million 
during  million of cash was provided from operating activities 
also during the period  million of cash was used for acquisitions  million was used for additions to fixed assets  million was used for payments on long term debt and million was used for payments of dividends 
our cash and cash equivalents of million at december  reflected an increase of million over our december  balance of million 
during  million of cash was provided from operating activities and million was raised from the sale of  shares of additional common stock in a follow on stock offering in march from these total funds  million of cash was used for acquisitions  million was used to repay long term debt  million was used to pay dividends and million was used for additions to fixed assets 
our ratio of current assets to current liabilities the current ratio was and at december  and  respectively 
as of december   our contractual cash obligations were as follows contractual cash obligations in thousands total less than year years years after years long term debt capital lease obligations other long term liabilities operating leases maximum future acquisition contingency payments total contractual cash obligations in july  we completed a private placement of million of unsecured senior notes the notes 
the million is divided into two series series a  for million due in and bearing interest at per year  and series b  for million due in and bearing interest at per year 
the closing on the series b notes occurred on july  the closing on the series a notes occurred on september  we have used  and anticipate continuing to use  the proceeds from the notes for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions and repayment of existing debt 
as of december   there was an outstanding balance of million on the notes 
in september  we established an unsecured revolving credit facility with a national banking institution that provided for available borrowings of up to million  with a maturity date of october  bearing an interest rate based upon the  or day libor plus to  depending upon our quarterly ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and non cash stock grant compensation 
a commitment fee of to per annum was assessed on the unused balance 
the day libor was as of december  there were no borrowings against this facility at december  in january  we entered into a million  unsecured seven year term loan agreement with a national banking institution 
borrowings under this facility bear interest based upon the  or day libor plus a credit risk spread ranging from to  depending upon our quarterly ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and non cash stock grant compensation 
the day libor was as of december  the loan was fully funded on january   and a balance of million remained outstanding as of december  this loan is to be repaid in equal quarterly principal installments of million through december effective january   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a national banking institution to lock in an effective fixed interest rate of for the remaining six years of the term loan  excluding our credit risk spread of between and 
in  we entered into a long term unsecured credit agreement with a major insurance company that provided for borrowings at an interest rate equal to the prime rate at december  plus 
in accordance with an august  amendment to this credit agreement  the outstanding balance was repaid in august  thus ending the credit agreement 
all of our credit agreements require us to maintain certain financial ratios and comply with certain other covenants 
we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december  and neither we nor our subsidiaries have ever incurred off balance sheet obligations through the use of  or investment in  off balance sheet derivative financial instruments or structured finance or special purpose entities organized as corporations  partnerships or limited liability companies or trusts 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investment portfolio and funds generated from operations  together with our unsecured revolving credit facility described above  will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs through at least the end of additionally  we believe that funds generated from future operations will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs  including the required annual principal payments on our long term debt 
historically  much of our cash has been used for acquisitions 
if additional acquisition opportunities should become available that exceed our current cash flow  we believe that given our relatively low debt to total capitalization ratio  we would have the ability to raise additional capital through either the private or public debt markets 
in december  a universal shelf registration statement that we filed with the securities and exchange commission sec covering the public offering and sale  from time to time  of an aggregate of up to million of debt and or equity securities  was declared effective 
the net proceeds from the sale of such securities could be used to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures  and to meet working capital needs 
the common stock follow on offering of  shares in march was made pursuant to this shelf registration statement 
as of december   approximately million of the universal shelf registration remains available 
if we needed to publicly raise additional funds  we may need to register additional securities with the sec 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and equity prices 
we are exposed to market risk through our investments  revolving credit line and term loan agreements 
our invested assets are held as cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  available for sale marketable equity securities  non marketable equity securities and certificates of deposit 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and equity price risk 
the fair values of our cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  and certificates of deposit at december  and approximated their respective carrying values due to their short term duration and therefore such market risk is not considered to be material 
we do not actively invest or trade in equity securities 
in addition  we generally dispose of any significant equity securities received in conjunction with an acquisition shortly after the acquisition date 
however  we have no current intentions to add or dispose of any of the  common stock shares of rock tenn company  a publicly held nyse company  which we have owned for more than ten years 
the investment in rock tenn company accounted for and of the total value of available for sale marketable equity securities  non marketable equity securities and certificates of deposit as of december  and  respectively 
the value of our holdings of rock tenn company s common stock at december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
each decrease in market value of these securities would result in a decrease in value of approximately  and  from the fair value of those investments at december  and  respectively 
to hedge the risk of increasing interest rates from january  through the remaining six years of our seven year million term loan  on december  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of  that effectively converted the floating rate interest payments based on a london interbank offering rate libor to fixed interest rate payments at 
this agreement did not impact or change the required to credit risk spread portion of the term loan 
the fair value of this interest rate swap agreement at december   was a liability of  a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the company s exposure to marked risk related to its interest rate position 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates relating to the interest rate swap agreement 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in a change of  in the interest rate swap agreement 
we do not otherwise enter into derivatives  swaps or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
