net sales from continuing operations decreased  or  for the fiscal year ended august  revenue from service contracts from continuing operations decreased to  for the fiscal year ended august   as compared to  for the fiscal year ended august  such decreases are largely impacted by the deflationary pressure in the furniture industry caused by a change in the source of supply to china  which reduced unit prices to customers 
in addition  the reduction in merchandise sales was affected by a decline in overall demand within the furniture industry sector  as well as going out of business promotions by a competitor during the fiscal year ended august  the decrease in merchandise sales directly impacted home delivery income and revenues from service contracts

in addition  we received proceeds of  in principal on notes due from the private company 
we have negotiated extended payment terms with principal suppliers effective september the private company has waived certain shortfall payments and we are planning the closing of certain unproductive stores during fiscal as a result  although general trends in the economy have adversely affected retail sales  in the opinion of management  cash flows from operations will be adequate to fund operations during fiscal on july   we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement and a security agreement the security agreement with caye home furnishings  llc agent  caye upholstery  llc and caye international furnishings  llc collectively  caye 
under the credit agreement  caye agrees to make available to us a credit facility of up to million  effectively extending caye s payment terms for merchandise shipped to us from days to days after receipt of goods 
the amount available under this facility may be reduced in the event that we do not maintain a specified level of eligible accounts receivable  eligible inventory and cash in deposit accounts

based on the payment terms of these offset agreements  current obligations of the private company and the unconsolidated licensees as of august  have been subsequently paid 
in fiscal  we opened one new store and closed stores 
since the end of fiscal  we have not closed any stores and the private company has not closed any stores 
we anticipate closing five to ten stores during fiscal for the fiscal years ended august  and august   we had  and  respectively  in capital expenditures from continuing operations 
we currently anticipate capital expenditures of approximately  during fiscal to support the maintenance of existing facilities during the next fiscal year 
we do not anticipate the need for outside financing for such expansion 
the settlement agreements impact our liquidity  capital resources and operations in a number of ways  including 
in return for providing warehousing services to the stores owned by the private company  the private company will pay us i through april   a fee for all fabric protection and warranty services sold in their stores plus of their yearly net sales for net sales up to an aggregate of  and of their yearly net sales for net sales in excess of  and ii during each month period after april   until we either buy the private company or until december   a fee based on all fabric protection and warranty services sold in their stores plus of their yearly net sales 

we have the right to open an unlimited number of stores in the state of new york for a royalty of  per year which includes stores already opened  provided however  that on november   the management agreement and license pursuant to which we are required to make such royalty payments to the private company was amended  such that the private company has agreed to waive its rights to receive from us such annual royalty payment during the period commencing january  through april   the date on which court approval was granted 

the private company is obligated to pay us  per month for advertising 
this represents a decrease from the  per month to which we were previously entitled 
in addition  if private company sales had been less than  for the initial period from january  through august  or are less than  for each succeeding month period commencing august   we must reimburse the private company for every dollar of sales under those amounts subject to the  and  caps described in the paragraph below 
we were obligated to pay the private company  and  under this provision in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 

because we may negatively impact the private company s sales by opening additional stores of our own within the state of new york and because we will be managing the private company s stores  we agreed to pay the private company of the amount by which its net sales for the initial period from january  through august  were less than  provided that if its sales fell below  for that initial period  we were obligated to pay the private company of such shortfall amount  provided further that such amounts  together with amounts we were required to pay for advertising if the private company s sales had dropped below  during such initial period  shall not have  in the aggregate  exceeded  for such initial period 
upon the expiration of the initial period  if the private company s sales during any month period commencing on august  are less than  we are obligated to pay the private company of such shortfall amount  provided that if its yearly net sales fall below  we will pay the private company of such shortfall amount  provided further that such amounts  together with amounts we may pay for advertising if the private company s sales drop below  during in any month period  shall not  in the aggregate  exceed  during such month period 
we were obligated to pay the private company  and  under this provision in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
on november   the management agreement and license pursuant to which we are required to make such payments to the private company was amended such that the private company has agreed to waive its rights to receive the payments described above during the period commencing january  through august  this waiver also covers any payments during such period in the event that the settlement agreements are approved by the court and become effective during such period 

harley j 
greenfield  our chairman and chief executive officer and a principal stockholder  and edward seidner  our executive vice president  former director and a principal stockholder had agreed to be responsible for up to an aggregate of  of amounts due under these provisions in each year 
this agreement with messrs 
greenfield and seidner was terminated effective july  and they were not required to pay  for the year ended august  the company recorded  of compensation expense and a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital representing the benefit received by messrs 
greenfield and seidner as a result of the termination of the agreement 

in settlement of certain disputes as to amounts due us from the private company  the private company has executed three promissory notes to us in the aggregate principal amount of  including a note in the principal amount of  due over three years and bearing interest at per annum  a note in the principal amount of  due over five years and bearing interest at per annum  and a note in the principal amount of  due over five years without interest  plus amounts owed as of the date in which settlement was approved by the court  for purchasing and other services 
as of october   we have collected all  in principal on the notes 

the effect of these agreements with the private company  including our assumption of the warehousing responsibilities  improved our operating results by  in fiscal which includes the recovery of  of prior year receivables and other amounts and adversely effected our operating results by  and  in fiscal and  respectively  compared to the results we would have achieved based on the same sales levels under the agreements effective prior to the initial operating agreement 
there is no assurance that the agreement will improve our future operating results in the future 
for a more detailed discussion of the proposed settlement agreement and the interim operating agreement  see certain relationships and related transactions in our proxy statement to be furnished in connection with our annual meeting of stockholders to be held february   which is hereby incorporated by reference 
the following table sets forth our future contractual obligations in total  for each of the next five years and thereafter  as of august  such obligations include the retail store and warehouse leases  the lease for the executive office  written employment contracts for two of our executive officers  and agreements to pay the private company royalties 
dollars in thousands thereafter total operating leases for retail stores  warehouses and executive office royalty payments to the private company employment contracts fabric protection fees to the private company total contractual obligations the obligation to make these payments terminates on the earliest of i the closing of the asset acquisition following an exercise by us of our option to purchase substantially all of the assets of the private company under the option agreement  ii april   unless the parties extend the license term  in which case the date shall be december   iii the termination of manager s role as manager under the agreement  or iv on such date as is determined by an arbitrator or a court 
for purposes of calculating the amount we have assumed the license will run out on april  the table does not include a commitment to pay the private company a maximum of million annually see discussion above in shortfall payments 
on november  harley greenfield  rami abada and edward seidner voluntarily reduced their annual salaries by   and  respectively 
effective august   such persons began receiving their salaries at their pre reduction levels 
significant accounting policies the receivable from the private company as of august  represents current charges aggregating  principally for merchandise transfers  warehousing services and advertising costs  which are payable within days of the end of the month in which the transactions originate 
such amount has been fully paid subsequent to the balance sheet date 
the arrangement with respect to the transfer of merchandise between the private company  which operates retail stores operating under the jennifer convertibles name  and us arises from the private company s desire to avail itself of our economic leverage in purchasing merchandise for its jennifer convertibles stores 
the purchasing agreement provides that the we will purchase merchandise on behalf of ourselves and the private company and bill the private company at cost as invoiced by the vendor and pass through to the private company the benefit of volume related discounts received from the vendor 
we do not believe it likely that the private company  if purchasing directly from vendors  would get the same favorable volume related pricing that we receive 
in effect  we are accommodating the private company  which is a related party 
the merchandise transfers are not reflected in our consolidated statements of operations and do not impact our earnings 
sales and delivery fees paid by customers are recognized as revenue upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer 
sales are made on either a non financed or financed basis 
a minimum deposit of is typically required upon placing a non financed sales order with the balance payable upon delivery 
commencing june   and prior to may   a subsidiary of the private company assumed all performance obligations and risks of any loss under the lifetime protection plans and accordingly  we recognized revenue from the sale of service contracts related to the plans during such periods at the time of sale to the customer 
during the period from may  through june  as part of the interim operating agreement entered into with the private company  we agreed to assume responsibility and risk of loss under the plans for sales of service contracts during such period and accordingly revenue from sales of the service contracts was deferred and amortized into income in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing services under the plans 
inflation there was no significant impact on our operations as a result of inflation during the three fiscal years ended august   august  and august  risk factors cautionary statements regarding forward looking statements 
this annual report contains certain forward looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form k should be read as being applicable to all forward looking statements wherever they appear in this annual report on form k 
there is no assurance we will operate profitably 
we incurred a net loss of   and  in the fiscal years ended august   august  and august   respectively 
the furniture business is cyclical and we have been impacted and will continue to be affected by changes in such cycles  by losses from new stores  the overall economic and political climate  changes in consumer preferences or demographics or unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause us to continue to incur losses from operations 
we may be liable for up to  per year of short fall payments to the private company 
as part of settlement with the private company  we obtained the right to open an unlimited number of stores in new york for a royalty of  per year 
because we will be managing the private company s stores and because we may negatively impact the private company s sales by opening stores in its territory  we agreed to pay the private company up to  for the initial period beginning january  and ended august  and  per year thereafter  if its sales drop below specified levels 
for the initial period  which ended august   the amount of short fall payments we paid to the private company was  and for fiscal years ended august  and august  the amount was  and  respectively 
on november   the management agreement and license pursuant to which we are required to make such payments to the private company was amended such that the private company has agreed to waive its rights to receive the payments described above during the period commencing january  through august  in addition  pursuant to the amendment  the private company has agreed to waive its rights to receive from us an annual royalty payment in the amount of  per year during the period commencing january  through april   the date of court approval 
our company could suffer from potential conflicts of interest 
potential conflicts of interest exist since harley j 
greenfield  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and edward b 
seidner  our executive vice president  and a former director  are owed over million by the private company  which owns  controls or licenses the private company stores 
accordingly  such persons derive substantial economic benefits from the private company 
in addition  fred love  the co founder of the related private company  was mr 
greenfield s brother in law 
mr 
love passed away in october and jane love  mr 
greenfield s sister  is currently acting as the interim president of the private company 
circumstances may arise in which the interest of the private company stores  of the private company or of mr 
greenfield and mr 
seidner will conflict with our interests 
there are also numerous relationships  and have been numerous transactions  between us and the private company  including an agreement under which we warehouse and purchase merchandise for the private company  manage its stores and provide it other services 
see certain relationships and related transactions in our proxy statement to be furnished in connection with our annual meeting of stockholders to be held february   which is hereby incorporated by reference 
we heavily depend on two suppliers 
we purchase a significant percentage of our merchandise from klaussner  which also manufactures furniture under the sealy r brand name 
during the fiscal year ended august   we purchased approximately of our merchandise from klaussner and of our merchandise from caye 
since a large portion of our revenues have been derived from sales of klaussner and caye products  the loss of these suppliers could have a material adverse impact on us until alternative sources of supply are established 
our obligations to caye are secured by substantially all of our assets 
klaussner is also a principal stockholder and creditor of ours and owns retail stores that compete with ours 
klaussner s and caye s position as a significant creditors could potentially result in a temporary or permanent loss of our principal supply of merchandise  if  for example  klaussner and caye halted supply because we defaulted on or were late in making our payments to them 
see certain relationships and related transactions in our proxy statement to be furnished in connection with our annual meeting of stockholders to be held february   which is hereby incorporated by reference 
the cyclical nature of the furniture industry poses risks to us from prolonged economic downturn 
the furniture industry has been historically cyclical  fluctuating with general economic cycles 
during economic downturns  the furniture industry tends to experience longer periods of recession and greater declines than the general economy 
we believe that the industry is significantly influenced by economic and political conditions generally and particularly by consumer behavior and confidence  the level of personal discretionary spending  housing activity  interest rates  credit availability  demographics and overall consumer confidence 
all of these factors are currently being negatively affected by the economic downturn and a prolonged economic downturn might have a material adverse effect on our business 
competition in the furniture industry could cost us sales and cause us to reduce prices 
the retail sofabed business is highly competitive and includes competition from traditional furniture retailers and department stores as well as numerous discount furniture outlets 
our stores may face sharp price cutting  as well as imitation and other forms of competition  and we cannot prevent or restrain others from utilizing a similar marketing format 
although we are the largest sofabed specialty retail dealer in the united states  many of our competitors have considerably greater financial resources 
a number of our store leases are month to month and accordingly the stores may need to halt operations on short notice 
a number of our store leases are month to month 
accordingly  if  at the end of a monthly lease period  we are unable to negotiate favorable terms for the new lease period or unable to renew such lease  we may need to halt operations at such location on short notice  which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may have difficulty obtaining additional financing 
our ability to expand and support our business may depend upon our ability to obtain additional financing 
we may have difficulty obtaining debt or equity financing 
on july   we entered into a credit agreement and a security agreement with caye  pursuant to which caye agreed to provide us with million of debt financing 
as of august  we owed caye  most of our assets are pledged to caye as security for the amounts we owe under the caye credit and security agreements 
from time to time  our financial position has made it difficult for us to secure third party consumer financing 
inability to offer such financing adversely affects sales 
harley j 
greenfield and current management are likely to retain control 
as of november   harley j 
greenfield  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer and principal stockholder  beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
approximately of the outstanding common stock is beneficially owned by all officers and directors as a group  including messrs 
greenfield and seidner 
since the holders of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights  such officers and directors ownership of our common stock will likely enable them to exercise significant influence in matters such as the election of our directors and other matters submitted for stockholder approval 
also  the relationship of such persons to the private company could serve to perpetuate management s control in light of the private company s relationship to us 
our future success depends heavily on two executives 
our future success will depend substantially upon the abilities of harley j 
greenfield  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer and one of our principal stockholders  as well as rami abada  our president  chief operating officer and chief financial officer 
the loss of mr 
greenfield s and or mr 
abada s services could materially adversely affect our business and our prospects for the future 
we do not have key man insurance on the lives of such individuals 
we are not likely to declare dividends on common stock 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we currently anticipate that we will retain all our earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and  therefore  do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
also  under the terms of the caye credit and security agreements  we are prohibited from paying any dividends on our common stock
