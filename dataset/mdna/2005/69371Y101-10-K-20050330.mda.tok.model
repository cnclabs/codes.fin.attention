item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we encourage you to read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes  which are included in this annual report 
our discussion of results of operations and financial condition includes various forward looking statements about our markets  the demand for our products and services and our future results 
we based these statements on assumptions that we consider reasonable 
actual results may differ materially from those suggested by our forward looking statements for various reasons  including those discussed under risk factors and elsewhere 
introduction as described more fully under business  we evolved into a high value  independent provider of integrated communication solutions that enable communication providers to use our network and services as an alternative to building and maintaining their own network 
our customers include internet service providers isp  enhanced communications service providers esps and other direct providers of communication services to business or residential end users  collectively referred to as service providers  or sps 
in response to our changing business model  which as described above  is focused on providing communication solutions to other communication providers  on march   we sold the majority of our enterprise customer base to us telepacific corp 
telepacific while retaining our associated network assets 
under the terms of this transaction  telepacific acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities associated with our enterprise customer base in exchange for million in cash 
in addition  we entered into a transition service agreement with telepacific that  among other things  obligates us to provide certain 
table of contents transition services to telepacific at our estimated cost  for up to a one year period subject to extension for two additional three month periods 
we are unable to estimate how our cost structure could be affected by the sale of our enterprise customer base due to the timing uncertainty of our transition service agreement with telepacific 
we utilized the proceeds from the sale of our enterprise customer base to telepacific  as well as cash on hand  to repay our outstanding million senior secured note senior secured note to deutsche bank ag london deutsche bank  as well as retire the related warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock 
this debt repayment significantly reduces our outstanding debt  annual interest expense and potential equity dilution 
see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we achieved record minutes of use on our network while our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  primarily due to a lower average rate per minute of use in  partially offset by higher settlements received in than in our billable minutes of use were up from to billion for the year ended december  the following table shows financial performance and noteworthy items in thousands except per share amounts financial performance revenues net loss income diluted net loss income per share noteworthy items ilec revenue settlements received restructuring and asset impairment charges loss gain on extinguishment of debt adjusted ebitda represents earnings before interest expense  net  income taxes  depreciation and amortization and is adjusted for restructuring charges  impairment charges  gain loss from asset dispositions and gain loss on extinguishment of debt 
for the years ended december   and adjusted ebitda was million  million and million  respectively 
although adjusted ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles  we believe adjusted ebitda is a common measure used by analysts and investors to evaluate our capacity to meet our obligations 
we also use adjusted ebitda as an internal measurement tool and accordingly  we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides useful and relevant information 
the table included in item above reconciles net loss income income to adjusted ebitda to net cash provided by operating activities 
we derive our revenues from monthly recurring charges  usage charges and amortization of initial non recurring charges 
we provided services to both retail and wholesale customers 
monthly recurring charges included the fees paid by customers for lines in service and additional features on those lines  as well as equipment collocation services 
usage charges consist of fees paid by end users for each call made  fees paid by our intercarrier customers as intercarrier compensation for completion of their customers calls through our network  and access charges paid by carriers for long distance traffic terminated on our network 
initial non recurring charges consist of fees paid by end users for the installation of our service 
these payments and related costs up to the amount of revenues were recognized as revenue and expensed ratably over the term of the service contracts  which is generally to months 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery of the product or performance of the service has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we also have carrier customers who pay us to terminate their originating call traffic on our network 
these payments consist of meet point  transit traffic and intercarrier compensation payments  collectively referred to as intercarrier compensation 
intercarrier compensation payments are a function of the number of 
table of contents calls we terminate  the minutes of use associated with such calls and the rates we are compensated at by the ilecs 
intercarrier compensation payments have historically been a significant portion of our revenues but the intercarrier payments are not currently a targeted customer 
in particular  intercarrier compensation payments accounted for  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
although the rate at which we believe we will be compensated by the ilecs in is expected to be consistent with  the sale of our enterprise customer base to telepacific may affect the percentage of total revenues represented by intercarrier compensation in the failure  for any reason  of one or more ilecs from which we ordinarily receive intercarrier compensation payments to make all or a significant portion of such payments would adversely affect our financial results 
our right to receive intercarrier compensation payments from ilecs  as well as the right of clecs and other competitors to receive such payments is the subject of numerous regulatory and legal challenges 
for example  in  verizon and sbc adopted the federal communications commission s  or fcc s  intercarrier isp comp ensation order 
the fcc isp order introduced a series of declining intercarrier compensation pricing tiers for minutes of use  at rates starting below the rates previously negotiated in our interconnection agreements icas with both carriers 
the lowest pricing tier specified by the fcc isp order was reached on june  and will remain in effect until such time that a replacement fcc isp order  may become effective 
additionally  the fcc isp order introduced artificial annual growth limits on compensable minutes of use subject to intercarrier compensation based on the composition and balance of traffic between carriers 
the fcc ceased enforcing the growth cap in october the impacts of the fcc s isp order affected our intercarrier compensation payments for the years ended december   and as noted above 
as technology continues to evolve with the corresponding development of new products and services  there is no guarantee we will retain our customers with our existing product and service offerings or with any new products or services we may develop in the future 
traditional dial up access to the internet  although a mature technology  remains a large target market for us 
major segments of this market may experience migration to broadband access technologies where available and competitively priced 
while we remain focused on serving the needs of our customers who provide dial up access to their end users  with the evolution of new technologies many new internet protocol ip applications are now available  such as voip  which have presented us with new product development and sales opportunities 
we are developing and overlaying new products and services that take advantage of these new technologies to further increase the utilization of our network 
competition in the communication services market has resulted in the consolidation of companies in our industry  a trend we expect to continue 
in order to grow our business and better serve our customers  we continue to consider new business strategies  including potential acquisitions or new business lines 
we believe that the statewide footprint of our network  which encompasses all of the major metropolitan areas of california  provides us with a significant competitive advantage that will enable us to successfully compete in the future  but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to sustain continued growth 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  in connection with the audit of our year end financial statements  we tested our long lived tangible and intangible assets to determine whether the carrying amounts of such assets were recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows 
primarily as a result of ongoing price compression and recent industry trends in the dial up internet access market  we recorded non cash asset impairment charges of million for our tangible assets 
in performing the test  we determined that the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows directly related to the existing service potential of the assets were less than the carrying value of the assets  therefore  an impairment charge was required 
we engaged a third party valuation specialist to assist us in evaluating the fair value of our assets using a sales comp arison approach  as well as a replacement cost approach 
the impairment charges represented the difference between the fair value of the property and equipment and its carrying value and are included within impairment of assets in the consolidated statements of operations 
as a result of the asset impairments  a new cost basis was established for those assets that were impaired 
the new cost basis resulted in a reduction of gross property and equipment and did not change the remaining estimated useful lives 
as a result of this impairment charge  future depreciation expense is expected to be less for the affected assets than in prior years 

table of contents in connection with the completion of the sale of our enterprise customer base to telepacific on march   we recorded during the first quarter of net restructuring and other charges of approximately  primarily consisting of employee separation costs for employees previously associated with the enterprise customer base 
out of this amount  we anticipate that future cash expenditures associated with the separation plan will be approximately  this separation plan will impact approximately employees  the majority of which were involuntary terminations 
we anticipate that the majority of the employees associated with this separation plan will leave their positions by the end of see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table summarizes the results of operations as a percentage of our revenues for the years ended december   and loss from operations for  and includes restructuring and impairment charges totaling million  million and million  respectively

table of contents billable minutes of use were billion for the year ended december   up from billion 
of these minutes  billion and billion were subject to intercarrier compensation in and  respectively 
the following table describes the main components of our intercarrier compensation revenues change in thousands except minutes of use minutes of use subject to intercarrier compensation revenue billions average intercarrier compensation per minute of use intercarrier compensation before settlements amounts withheld from prior periods and recorded as revenue intercarrier compensation payments received intercarrier compensation decreased by million or to million from million in the main reason for the decrease was a decrease of in the average rate per minute of use due to being the first full year at the lowest pricing tier specified by the fcc intercarrier isp order 
direct billings to sp customers decreased during the year ended december  from the same period in by million  or  to million from million during the year ended december  primarily due to customers disconnecting lines not in use and a reduction in the average rate for which we are compensated in our sp contracts in compared to due to the highly competitive nature of this market 
direct billings to enterprise business customers increased in the year ended december  from the same period in by million  or  to million from million during the same period in primarily due to increased lines in service 
this increase was partially offset by lower average revenue per line in as compared to due to the highly competitive nature of this market 
due to the sale of our enterprise customer base to telepacific on march   we are no longer directly serving the enterprise market 
accordingly  we do not expect to record revenues from enterprise customers after the date of the transaction 
outbound local and long distance revenues  including   and numbers and travel card calls  decreased during the year ended december  by million or to million from million during the year ended december  the decline in revenue was principally due to the highly competitive nature of this market 
the million  or  decrease in dedicated transport revenues to million during the year ended december  from million during the same period in primarily related to a decline in the average revenue per unit 
switched access revenues decreased in the year ended december  from the same period in by million  or  to million from million in the year ended december  primarily due to lower rates despite an increase in minutes per use 
our significant costs and expenses for the years ended december  are as follows change dollars in millions costs and expenses network selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses 
table of contents our consolidated network expenses for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million from million for the corresponding period in primarily due to fewer negotiated supplier credits received in than in our consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million for the same period in primarily due to lower costs for repairs and maintenance and insurance  partially offset by the costs incurred with the sale of our enterprise customer base to telepacific communications of approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses were and of revenues for the year ended december  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in mainly due to the cost incurred with the sale of our enterprise customer base as discussed above 
we expect salaries and wages to be lower in due to the sale of our enterprise customer base to telepacific communications 
we are unable to estimate how our other costs could be affected by the sale of our enterprise customer base due to the timing uncertainty of our transition service agreement with telepacific 
our consolidated depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  decreased million to million  from million for the same period in primarily due to assets becoming fully depreciated 
estimates and assumptions are used in setting depreciable lives 
assumptions are based on internal studies of use  industry data on average asset lives  recognition of technological advancements and understanding of business strategy 
during the first quarter of  we changed the estimated lives of certain assets  which increased depreciation and amortization for this change reduced the useful life for phone equipment provided to customers and computer hardware from years to years and extended the useful life of some leasehold improvements from years to up to years 
these changes were made to more closely match our accounting treatment to the expected lives of these assets 
as a result of the change  we incurred a charge in  which increased depreciation expense for the year ended december   by million 
restructuring charges restructuring charges were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  a summary of the restructuring expenses and the associated remaining liability  which is included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and  consist of the following restructuring additional restructuring liability as restructuring liability as of dec

 incurred payments dollars in thousands rent expense for vacated premises circuit obligations other charges the balances of the restructuring liabilities relate to restructuring plans approved in june and august we did not approve any new restructuring plan in or the restructuring plan primarily provided for the closure of our switch facility in colorado 
the restructuring plan was in 
table of contents response to the further weakening of the economy  additional competitive pressure from competitors who had reorganized and lowered their cost structure  overcapacity in our industry and lower demand from customers for our products and services 
the amount of the reserve for vacated premises is equal to the monthly lease payment of the unoccupied space  less any estimated sublease income  multiplied by the remaining months on the lease 
in regards to the colorado facility  no sublease income was estimated due to the specialized nature of this facility 
during the second quarter of  we recorded additional restructuring charges of approximately  due to increased common area operating expenses at the colorado facility 
this amount was partially offset by reversals of  of previously recorded restructuring charges related to the timing and amounts for sublease income  primarily in san diego 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded additional restructuring charges of  for an estimated increase in rent expense at the san diego and san francisco office locations 
during the second and third quarters of  we recorded additional restructuring charges of approximately  and  respectively  due to on going negotiations regarding the amount owed for circuit commitment obligations  which we paid off during the third quarter of during the third quarter of  we reversed  of previously recorded restructuring charges related primarily to professional fees that were anticipated but not incurred 
the final cash payment to be recorded against the restructuring reserve is currently expected to occur in march during  the company recorded additional restructuring charges of  relating to office space in san diego  california 
the amount of the reserve recorded is equal to the monthly lease payment of the unoccupied space multiplied by the remaining months on the lease 
sub lease income was not anticipated in primarily due to economic conditions 
in addition  during  the company reversed  of previously recorded restructuring charges relating to professional fees that were anticipated but not incurred 
impairment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  in connection with the audit of our year end financial statements  we tested our long lived tangible and intangible assets to determine whether the carrying amounts of such assets were recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows 
primarily as a result of ongoing price compression and recent industry trends in the dial up internet access market  we recorded non cash asset impairment charges of million for our tangible assets

as a result of the asset impairments  a new cost basis was established for those assets that were impaired 
the new cost basis resulted in a reduction of gross property and equipment and did not change the remaining estimated useful lives 
as a result of this impairment charge  future depreciation expense is expected to be less for the affected assets than in prior years 
loss from operations loss from operations for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   due to the factors discussed in the preceding paragraphs 
interest expense  net our consolidated interest expense  net for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million for the same period in interest expense is net of interest income 
in december  we successfully completed a financing transaction in which we issued a million senior secured note to deutsche bank  which permitted us to reduce our debt level by repurchasing million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes in a tender offer 
as part of this transaction  a discount of million on the senior secured note was established representing the fair value of the warrants that were part of the 
table of contents transaction 
this discount is amortized to interest expense on an effective yield to maturity basis over the life of the senior secured note 
in march  we paid off the senior secured note utilizing the proceeds from the sale of our enterprise customer base to telepacific  as well as cash on hand

the million  or decrease in dedicated transport revenues to million during the year ended december  from million during the same period in primarily relates to reduced service levels 
switched access revenues decreased in the year ended december  from the same period in by million  or  to million from million in the year ended december  this decrease was mainly due to payments received in that were previously withheld 
our significant costs and expenses for the years ended december  are as follows costs and expenses change dollars in millions network selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses our consolidated network expenses for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million from million for the corresponding period in the decrease in expense is

estimates and assumptions are used in setting depreciable lives 
assumptions are based on internal studies of use  industry data on average asset lives  recognition of technological advancements and understanding of business strategy 
our consolidated depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  increased million to million  from million for the same period in the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to the change in estimated useful lives of certain assets  which we made in january  and a higher fixed asset depreciable base in this change reduced the useful life for phone equipment provided to customers and computer hardware from years to years and extended the useful life of some leasehold improvements from years to up to years 
these changes were made to more closely match our accounting treatment to the expected lives of these assets

cash requirements 
the telecommunications service business is capital intensive 
our operations have required the expenditure of substantial amounts of cash for the design  acquisition  construction and implementation of our network 
we continue to seek further ways to enhance our infrastructure in and beyond 
as a result of various capital projects and our business plan  as currently contemplated  we anticipate making capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  of approximately million for however  the actual cost of capital expenditures during will depend on a variety of factors 
accordingly  our actual capital requirements may exceed  or fall below  the amounts described above 
during the normal course of business  we may enter into agreements with some suppliers  which allow these suppliers to have equipment or inventory available for purchase based upon criteria as defined by us 
as of december   we did not have any material future purchase commitments to purchase equipment from any of our vendors 
debt outstanding 
at december  long term debt and capital lease obligations consist of the following dollars in thousands senior notes senior secured note  net of discount of  capital lease obligation notes payable less current portion of notes payable and capital lease 
table of contents the senior notes  of which there is million in principal amount outstanding at december  and  mature on february  and bear interest at per annum payable in semiannual installments  with all principal due in full on february  in december  we solicited consents to effect certain proposed amendments to the indenture governing the senior notes 
these amendments to the indenture governing the senior notes eliminated most of the indenture s principal restrictive covenants and amended certain other provisions contained in the indenture 
on march  we utilized the proceeds from the sale of our enterprise customer base to telepacific of approximately million  as well as cash on hand  to repay our outstanding million senior secured note  as well as retire the related warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock 
prior to this repayment  the senior secured note carried an interest rate of libor plus at december   and had been scheduled to mature in december under the terms of the guaranty and security agreement related to the senior secured note  we granted deutsche bank a security interest in substantially all of our assets and agreed to certain covenants including limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  incur liens  sell assets and pay dividends 
as a result of the repayment of the senior secured note  this security interest in our assets has been removed and we are no longer subject to these covenants 
as of december we were in compliance with the covenants of the senior secured note 
during we allocated million of the proceeds of the senior secured note to debt and million to the warrants on the basis of their relative fair values 
this allocation of proceeds of the warrants created a discount on the senior note 
the increase in the senior secured note of million in over was due primarily to the amortization of the discount during during the second quarter of  we entered into a secured financing arrangement with merrill lynch capital  a division of merrill lynch business financial services  inc  pursuant to which we could borrow up to an aggregate amount of million  subject to certain conditions 
this financing arrangement was structured in a manner that provided for multiple credit facilities up to an aggregate of million with each facility having separate closing dates and repayment schedules 
this secured financing arrangement commitment had an expiration date of december  the principal and accrued interest of each facility is payable in equal monthly installments 
we have the option to prepay the outstanding facility after months subject to a maximum premium of of the outstanding facility 
interest on each facility was fixed at plus the year swap rate  as published by bloomberg professional services  determined two business days prior to the closing date of each facility 
we used the proceeds of this financing arrangement to acquire new telecommunication switch and related equipment  with secured borrowings under this financing arrangement 
during  we borrowed approximately million  and as of december   the principal balance was million and was included under notes payable in the above table 
in may  the company completed financing agreements with cisco for various network equipment 
these financing agreements were comprised of million of equipment capital leases and a million note payable exchanged for a month maintenance services agreement 
as of december   the principal balance of the capital lease was million and is included under capital lease obligations in the above table 
as of december   the balance of the note payable was million and is included under notes payable in the above table 
future uses and sources of cash 
our principal sources of funds for are anticipated to be current cash and short term investment balances and cash flows from operating activities 
we believe that these funds will provide us with sufficient liquidity and capital resources for us to fund our business plan for the next months 
no assurance can be given  however  that this will be the case 
we may also seek to obtain leases or additional lines of credit in there can be no assurance that additional lines of credit or leases will be made available to us on terms that we find acceptable 
we discuss our material contractual obligations under contractual obligations below 
as currently contemplated  we expect to fund  among other things interest payments of approximately million on senior notes and other notes  anticipated capital expenditures of approximately million  and capital lease payments including interest of approximately million 

table of contents the foregoing statements do not take into account i acquisitions  which  if made  are expected to be funded through a combination of cash and equity ii the repurchase of any of our remaining outstanding senior notes or iii any potential payments made in respect of adjustments which may arise from our ongoing tax audits 
depending upon our rate of growth and profitability  among other things  we may require additional equity or debt financing to meet our working capital requirements or capital needs 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when required  or  if available  will be on terms satisfactory to us 
key factors which could affect our liquidity include future demand of our services  financial stability of our customers  outcomes of regulatory proceedings involving intercarrier compensation  capital expenditures  our debt payments  capital lease repayments  loss of enterprise revenues due to the sale of our enterprise customer base of approximately million  interest expense on debt  and development and market rollout of new service offerings 
our significant contractual obligations at december  were as follows less than over one year years years years total dollars in thousands operating leases senior secured note see note below senior notes capital leases notes payable total the senior secured note was to mature in december and is included in the above table 
however  on march   we utilized the proceeds from the sale of our enterprise customer base  as well as cash on hand  to repay our outstanding million senior secured note  net of million discount  as well as retire related warrants to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock 
see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements at december    and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  including entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we were engaged in such relationships 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had any material effect on our business over the past three years  however there can be no assurance that inflation will not affect us in future periods 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies critical accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each revenue recognition  provision for doubtful accounts receivable  estimated settlement of disputed billings  and impairment for long lived assets 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
thus  actual results could differ from estimates made and these differences could be material 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when there is pervasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery of the product or performance of the service has occurred  the selling price is fixed and determined  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
non refundable up front payments received for installation services and related costs up to the amount of installation revenues  are recognized as revenue and expense ratably over the term of the service contracts  generally to months 
any costs in excess of recognized revenues are expensed in the current period 
as of december  and  million and million  respectively  of installation payments received were deferred and are included in deferred revenues  and million and million  respectively  of associated costs were deferred and are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
revenues from service access agreements are recognized as the service is provided  except for intercarrier compensation fees paid by our intercarrier customers for completion of their customers calls through our network  and access charges paid by carriers for long distance traffic terminated on our network 
our right to receive this type of compensation is the subject of numerous regulatory and legal challenges 
until all issues affecting a given item of revenue are resolved  we will continue to recognize intercarrier compensation as revenue when the price becomes fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
some ilecs with which we have interconnection agreements had withheld payments from amounts billed by us under their agreements 
the process of collection of intercarrier compensation can be complex and subject to interpretation of regulations and laws 
this can lead to the requirement for negotiated settlements between us and the ilec where we agree to accept a portion of what we believe is owed to us 
these settlements generally reflect the mutual agreements of both parties that exist at the date of the settlement 
settlements were entered into with ilecs whereby the ilecs paid us an aggregate of million in and million in the settlements were included in revenues 
provision for doubtful accounts receivable 
provisions for allowances for doubtful accounts receivable are estimated based upon historical collection experience  customer delinquencies and bankruptcies  information provided by our customers  
table of contents observance of trends in the industry  and other current economic conditions 
at december  our provision for doubtful accounts receivable was million  which represented approximately of accounts receivable 
if an additional of our gross accounts receivable were deemed to be uncollectible at december   our provision for doubtful accounts and provision for bad debt expense would increase by approximately million 
if this information does not properly reflect future collections  our accounts receivable balance could be subject to change 
additionally  due to the sale of the enterprise customer base to telepacific as of march   trade accounts receivable is expected to decrease in see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
accruals for disputed billings 
during the ordinary course of business  we may be billed for carrier traffic for which management believes we are not responsible 
in such instances  we may dispute with the appropriate vendor and withhold payment until the matter is resolved 
our current disputes are primarily related to incorrect facility rates or incorrect billing elements we believe we are being charged 
management regularly reviews and monitors all disputed items and  based on industry experience  records an accrual that represents what we estimate that we owe on the disputed billings 
although we continue to actively try to expedite resolutions  often times the state public utilities commission must become involved to arbitrate such agreements 
this process is often not timely and resolutions are often subject to appeal 
as of december   the company has accrued approximately million  representing approximately of the gross amount of disputes in negotiation at this time 
if resolutions to items in negotiation are favorable or unfavorable to management s estimations  our reserve for disputed items may be subject to change 
long lived assets 
in  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate our long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
when we consider an asset to be impaired  it is written down to its estimated fair market value 
this is assessed based on factors specific to the type of asset 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  we make assumptions regarding  among other things  estimated future cash flows to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates and the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges for these assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the sec s rule related to market risk disclosure requires that we describe and quantify our potential losses from market risk sensitive instruments attributable to reasonably possible market changes 
market risk sensitive instruments include all financial or commodity instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to future changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  commodity prices or other market factors 
we are not exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates or commodity prices 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments nor do we hold securities for trading or speculative purposes 
at december   we had an outstanding million principal amount of senior secured notes payable 
these notes are at a rate of libor plus  which was at december  a hypothetical point increase in short term interest rates would reduce the annualized income before tax by approximately million as a result of higher interest expense 
additionally  we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our investments in cash equivalents and short term investments 
substantially all of our investments are in cash equivalents 
currently this reduces our exposure to long term interest rate changes 
a hypothetical decrease in short term interest rates would reduce the annualized pretax interest income on our million cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments at december  by approximately million
