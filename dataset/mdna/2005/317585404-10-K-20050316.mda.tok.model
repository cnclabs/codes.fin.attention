item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the risk based capital guidelines  the federal reserve board uses a leverage ratio as an additional tool to evaluate the capital adequacy of bank holding companies 
the leverage ratio is a company s tier capital divided by quarterly average consolidated assets 
certain highly rated bank holding companies may maintain a minimum leverage ratio of  but other bank holding companies may be required to maintain a leverage ratio of up to basis points above the regulatory minimum 
as of december   the company s leverage ratio was 
the federal banking agencies risk based and leverage ratios are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria  assuming that they have the highest regulatory rating 
banking organizations not meeting these criteria are expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum ratios 
the federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant 
federal reserve board guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels  without significant reliance on intangible assets 
imposition of liability for undercapitalized subsidiaries 
bank regulators are required to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems associated with insured depository institutions whose capital declines below certain levels 
in the event an institution becomes undercapitalized  it must submit a capital restoration plan 
the capital restoration plan will not be accepted by the regulators unless each company having control of the undercapitalized institution guarantees the subsidiary s compliance with 
table of contents the capital restoration plan up to a certain specified amount 
any such guarantee from a depository institutions holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy 
the aggregate liability of the holding company of an undercapitalized bank is limited to the lesser of of the institution s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount necessary to cause the institution to be adequately capitalized 
the bank regulators have greater power in situations where an institution becomes significantly or critically undercapitalized or fails to submit a capital restoration plan 
for example  a bank holding company controlling such an institution can be required to obtain prior federal reserve board approval of proposed dividends  or might be required to consent to a consolidation or to divest the troubled institution or other affiliates 
acquisitions by bank holding companies 
the bank holding company act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve board before it may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank  or ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank  if after such acquisition it would own or control  directly or indirectly  more than of the voting shares of such bank 
in approving bank acquisitions by bank holding companies  the federal reserve board is required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding company and the banks concerned  the convenience and needs of the communities to be served  and various competitive factors 
control acquisitions 
the change in bank control act prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring control of a bank holding company unless the federal reserve board has been notified and has not objected to the transaction 
under a rebuttable presumption established by the federal reserve board  the acquisition of or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under section of the exchange act  would  under the circumstances set forth in the presumption  constitute acquisition of control of the company 
in addition  any entity is required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve board under the bank holding company act before acquiring in the case of an acquirer that is a bank holding company or more of the company s outstanding common stock  or otherwise obtaining control or a controlling influence over the company 
the banks wyoming county bank wcb and first tier bank trust ftb are new york state chartered banks 
national bank of geneva nbg and bath national bank bnb are national banks chartered by the office of the comptroller of currency 
the fdic  through the bank insurance fund  insures all of the deposits of the four subsidiary banks 
ftb is a member of the federal reserve system 
the banks are subject to supervision and regulation that subject them to special restrictions  requirements  potential enforcement actions and periodic examination by the fdic  the federal reserve board and the new york state banking department in the case of the state chartered banks and the office of the comptroller of currency in the case of the national banks 
because the federal reserve board regulates the bank holding company parent of the banks  the federal reserve board also has supervisory authority  which directly affects the banks 
restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders 
transactions between the holding company and its subsidiaries  including the banks  are subject to section a of the federal reserve act  and to the requirements of regulation w 
in general  section a imposes limits on the amount of such transactions  and also requires certain levels of collateral for loans to affiliated parties 
it also limits the amount of advances to third parties  which are collateralized by the securities  or obligations of the company or its subsidiaries 
affiliate transactions are also subject to section b of the federal reserve act  and to the requirements of regulation w which generally requires that certain transactions between the holding company and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the banks  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving other nonaffiliated persons 

table of contents the restrictions on loans to directors  executive officers  principal shareholders and their related interests collectively referred to herein as insiders contained in the federal reserve act and regulation o apply to all insured institutions and their subsidiaries and holding companies 
these restrictions include limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made 
there is also an aggregate limitation on all loans to insiders and their related interests 
these loans cannot exceed the institution s total unimpaired capital and surplus  and the fdic may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate 
insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions 
restrictions on distribution of subsidiary bank dividends and assets 
dividends paid by the banks have provided a substantial part of the company s operating funds and  for the foreseeable future  it is anticipated that dividends paid by the banks will continue to be its principal source of operating funds 
capital adequacy requirements serve to limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the subsidiaries 
under federal law  the subsidiaries cannot pay a dividend if  after paying the dividend  a particular subsidiary will be undercapitalized 
the fdic may declare a dividend payment to be unsafe and unsound even though the bank would continue to meet its capital requirements after the dividend 
one of the terms of the occ formal agreements required nbg and bnb to adopt dividend policies that would permit them to declare dividends only when they are in compliance with their approved capital plan and the provisions of usc section and  and upon prior written notice to but not consent of the assistant deputy comptroller 
neither bank has had its respective capital plan approved by the occ or declared a dividend since entering into the agreements 
the boards of both nbg and bnb have recently adopted resolutions providing that no dividends will be declared without the prior written approval of the occ  and the board of the company has adopted a parallel resolution pursuant to which it has agreed not to request a dividend from either bank until their respective capital plans and proposed dividend declarations have been approved by the occ 
continued restrictions on the ability of nbg and bnb to pay dividends would adversely impact the company s ability to maintain its current level of dividends 
because the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries  the company s right to participate in the distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon the subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
in the event of a liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution  the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated creditors are entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of holders of any obligation of the institution to its shareholders  including any depository bank holding company such as the company or any shareholder or creditor thereof 
examinations 
the new york state banking department in the case of wcb and ftb  the office of the comptroller of the currency in the case of nbg and bnb  the federal reserve board and the fdic periodically examine and evaluate the banks 
based upon such examinations  the appropriate regulator may revalue the assets of the institution and require that it establish specific reserves to compensate for the difference between what the regulator determines the value to be and the book value of such assets 
audit reports 
insured institutions with total assets of million or more at the beginning of a fiscal year must submit annual audit reports prepared by independent auditors to federal and state regulators 
in some instances  the audit report of the institution s holding company can be used to satisfy this requirement 
auditors must receive examination reports  supervisory agreements and reports of enforcement actions 
in addition  financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  management s certifications concerning responsibility for the financial statements  internal controls and compliance with legal requirements designated by the fdic  and an attestation by the auditor regarding the statements of management relating to the internal controls must be submitted 
the fdic improvement act of requires that independent audit committees be formed  consisting of outside directors only 
the committees of institutions with assets of more than billion must include members with experience in banking or financial management must have access to outside counsel and must not include representatives of large customers

the fdic may establish higher minimum requirements if  for example  a bank has previously received special attention or has a high susceptibility to interest rate risk 
the fdic s risk based capital guidelines generally require banks to have a minimum ratio of tier capital to total risk weighted assets of and a ratio of total capital to total risk weighted assets of 
the capital categories have the same definitions for the company 
as of december   the ratio of tier capital to total risk weighted assets for the banks was for wcb  for nbg  for bnb  and for ftb  and the ratio of total capital to total risk weighted assets was for wcb  for nbg  for bnb  and for ftb 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the fdic s leverage guidelines require banks to maintain tier capital of no less than of average total assets  except in the case of certain highly rated banks for which the requirement is of average total assets 
as of december   the ratio of tier capital to average total assets leverage ratio was for wcb  for nbg  for bnb  and for ftb 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as part of the agreements in place with their primary regulator  nbg and bnb were required to develop capital plans enabling them to achieve  by march   tier leverage capital equal to of risk weighted assets  tier risk based capital equal to of risk weighted assets  and total risk based capital of of risk weighted assets 
each of the banks has met the required levels at each quarterly reporting period since december  corrective measures for capital deficiencies 
the federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action with respect to capital deficient institutions 
agency regulations define  for each capital category  the levels at which institutions are well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
a well capitalized bank has a total risk based capital ratio of or higher  a tier risk based capital ratio of or higher  a leverage ratio of or higher  and is not subject to any written agreement  order or directive requiring it to maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure 
an adequately capitalized bank has a total risk based capital ratio of or higher  a tier risk based capital ratio of or higher  a leverage ratio of or higher or higher if the bank was rated a composite in its most recent examination report and is not experiencing significant growth  and does not meet the criteria for a well capitalized bank 
a bank is undercapitalized if it fails to meet any one of the adequately capitalized ratios 
in addition to requiring undercapitalized institutions to submit a capital restoration plan  agency regulations contain broad restrictions on certain activities of undercapitalized institutions including asset growth  acquisitions  branch establishment and expansion into new lines of business 
with certain exceptions  an insured depository institution is prohibited from making capital distributions  including dividends  and is prohibited from paying management fees to control persons if the institution would be undercapitalized after any such distribution or payment 
as an institution s capital decreases  the fdic s enforcement powers become more severe 
a significantly undercapitalized institution is subject to mandated capital raising activities  restrictions on interest rates paid and transactions with affiliates  removal of management and other restrictions 
the fdic has only very limited discretion in dealing with a critically undercapitalized institution and is virtually required to appoint a receiver or conservator 
banks with risk based capital and leverage ratios below the required minimums may also be subject to certain administrative actions  including the termination of deposit insurance upon notice and hearing  or a temporary suspension of insurance without a hearing in the event the institution has no tangible capital 

table of contents deposit insurance assessments 
the bank subsidiaries must pay assessments to the fdic for federal deposit insurance protection 
the fdic has adopted a risk based assessment system as required by the fdic improvement act 
under this system  fdic insured depository institutions pay insurance premiums at rates based on their risk classification 
institutions assigned to higher risk classifications that is  institutions that pose a greater risk of loss to their respective deposit insurance funds pay assessments at higher rates than institutions that pose a lower risk 
an institution s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to the regulators 
in addition  the fdic can impose special assessments in certain instances 
the fdic maintains a process for raising or lowering all rates for insured institutions semi annually if conditions warrant a change 
under this system  the fdic has the flexibility to adjust the assessment rate schedule twice a year without seeking prior public comment  but only within a range of five cents per above or below the premium schedule adopted 
the fdic can make changes in the rate schedule outside the five cent range above or below the current schedule only after a full rulemaking with opportunity for public comment 
as of december   the most recent notification from the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic categorized the company and its subsidiary banks as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
for purposes of determining the annual deposit insurance assessment rate for insured depository institutions  each insured institution is assigned an assessment risk classification 
each institution s assigned risk classification is composed of a group and subgroup assignment based on capital group and supervisory subgroup 
although nbg and bnb remain assigned to the well capitalized capital group  during these two subsidiaries received notification of a downgrade in supervisory subgroup based on the formal agreements in place with the occ 
during  nbg received notification of a further downgrade in supervisory subgroup based on the occ report of examination for the period as of december  because of this downgrade  the company expects fdic insurance premiums to be measurably higher  with an estimated impact on earnings of approximately per share

following the closing of the credit facility with m t bank in december  loan proceeds were down streamed to nbg and bnb so that the capital levels required to be achieved by march  were met by december  nbg and bnb have continued to achieve the required capital levels quarterly throughout and including the period ended december  the nbg agreement also requires its board of directors to adopt  implement and ensure adherence to a written policy on extensions of overdraft credit and limit the circumstances under which nbg will be permitted to extend credit to its affiliates  and requires the bank to engage an independent appraiser to provide updated real estate appraisals where required 
the bnb agreement also requires its board of directors to adopt  implement and ensure adherence to a written action plan outlining proposed corrective action addressing issues in the pre existing matters requiring attention pertaining to interest rate risk measurement and monitoring systems 
also on september   in a letter to the federal reserve bank of new york  the company s primary regulator  the company terminated its financial holding company status and began operating instead as a bank holding company 
the change in status will not affect any non financial subsidiaries or activities currently being conducted by the company  although it will mean that future acquisitions or expansions of non financial activities may require prior federal reserve board approval and will be limited to those that are permissible for bank holding companies 
on december  management advised the audit committee of the company s board of directors of certain conditions that it concluded constituted a material weakness in its internal controls relating to financial reporting 
the audit committee concurred with management s finding 
the conditions that led to the conclusion of a material deficiency in financial reporting were associated with findings from reports 
table of contents issued in late fall of by an outside loan review firm retained by the company and also by roes issued to the boards of nbg and bnb by the occ in late the company retained a loan review firm to review the loan portfolios at all four of the company s bank subsidiaries 
the reports of the review  were as of june   and contained findings pertaining to the commercial related loan portfolios at wcb and nbg that were similar to the findings contained in the roes for nbg and bnb issued late in  covering the period ending december  the company has taken various corrective actions to remediate these conditions 
by their nature such actions require a period of time to influence the entire portfolio 
it is important to note that the nbg and bnb roes are based on an as of date of december   the outside loan review reports were based on an as of date of june  and that significant efforts to increase the company s supervision of the credit administration function at its banks and to improve training and hiring of bank personnel were made in during  the company substantially increased the staff and resources available to its chief risk officer and the centralized credit administration function that reports to him 
corporate commercial risk officers with credit administration oversight responsibility were added at the holding company level to support the company s banking subsidiaries 
the position of chief of community banking was created and filled to provide greater consistency and oversight of the commercial related loan administration function at all four bank subsidiaries 
new board members were added at nbg and bnb  and the board level compliance committees reorganized  with access to an outside consultant experienced in occ compliance matters 
centralized control was implemented for all risk rating reviews 
also  notwithstanding the high level of criticized loans at both banks  many of these criticized loans continue to perform in terms of the borrowers making timely principal and interest payments 
the outside loan review firm found the following with respect to the loan portfolios at wcb and nbg i a significant percentage of loans in the loan portfolios were identified as being improperly graded  ii in the case of wcb  new information pertinent to risk ratings was not acted upon in a timely manner  and iii there were deficiencies in loan portfolio administration at both banks  including incomplete or inaccurate credit analyses  poorly organized files and insufficient documentation of collateral 
in the case of nbg  a number of the loan review report findings were consistent with the roe for the period ended december  in its reports for both nbg and bnb  the occ concluded that some of the banks credit analysts and lenders were inexperienced and lacked adequate training and oversight and that there was an unacceptably high level of loan files with outdated  incomplete or inaccurate financial information 
in addition  in the case of nbg  the occ found that credit risk remained high and was increasing  and that  during the period covered by the examination  nbg s board and management supervision was unsatisfactory 
overall  the occ found that there was substantial noncompliance with the terms of the nbg formal agreement entered into in september  and stated that until problem loan levels decrease  loan losses subside and reputation risk stabilizes  it was highly unlikely that it would approve any dividend in the near future 
with respect to bnb  the occ also found a substantial number of instances of noncompliance with the formal agreement entered into in september  although the occ found that the board s compliance committee had strengthened its supervision and oversight since the prior examination 
as with nbg  the occ found that credit risk at bnb remained high and was increasing  and stated that until the high level of criticized assets was effectively reduced  payment of dividends would not be considered prudent 
both bnb and nbg have submitted proposed capital plans to the occ  which are currently under review 
the 
table of contents bnb capital plan calls for the upstreaming of dividends to the company beginning in the third quarter of the banks are the principal source of liquidity for the company 
under the terms of the formal agreements entered into by bnb and nbg with the occ  bnb and nbg must obtain occ approval of their capital plan prior to paying dividends  and  as noted above  neither bank has received approval for its capital plan 
continued restrictions on the ability of nbg and bnb to pay dividends would adversely impact the company s ability to maintain its current level of dividends 
due to the occ s overall rating of nbg  the company expects its fdic insurance premiums to be measurably higher  with an estimated impact on earnings of approximately per share 
a new examination cycle began at nbg and bnb in january the company s chief risk officer has been closely coordinating the efforts of his office with the occ examination teams at nbg and bnb to ensure complete communication and timely resolution of questions or issues identified by the occ 
on february   randolph brown  nbg s ceo  announced that he was resigning to pursue other interests 
a copy of an amendment to his employment agreement is included as an exhibit to this report 
thomas grover  the company s chief risk officer  has been named interim ceo of nbg

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general the principal objective of this discussion is to provide an overview of the financial condition and results of operations of the company during the year ended december  and the preceding two years 
this discussion and tabular presentations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
income 
the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on loans and securities and the cost of funds  consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan losses  service charges on deposits  financial services group fees and commissions  mortgage banking activities  gain or loss on the sale or call of investment securities and other miscellaneous income 
expenses 
the company s expenses primarily consist of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment  supplies and postage  amortization of intangible assets  computer and data processing  professional fees  other miscellaneous expense and income tax expense 
results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and the actions of regulatory authorities

diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  was  compared to in and in the return on average common equity in was  compared to in and in the return on average assets in was  compared to in and in net interest income  the principal source of the company s earnings  was million in comparable to million in and million in net interest margin was  and for the year ended december   and  respectively 
the most significant item affecting the last two years financial results was the provision for loan losses  which totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and the amount of the provision for loan losses results from increased levels of potential problem loans and nonperforming loans  with associated charge offs  and an increased allowance for loan losses due to the increased inherent risk of loss in the loan portfolio 
nonperforming assets totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
net loan charge offs were million  or of average loans  for the year ended december  compared to million  or of average loans for and million  or of average loans for commercial and commercial mortgage loans represented million  million and million of net charge offs in  and  respectively 
during  increased regulatory oversight was put in place in the form of formal agreements at the two national banks  nbg and bnb 
the company has taken various corrective actions to remediate its asset quality issues 
by their nature such actions require a period of time to become fully effective 
the company has increased its staff and resources available to the chief risk officer and the centralized credit function 
responsibilities for commercial loan credit administration requirements have been placed in a new position  portfolio manager  with responsibilities for timely line renewals  risk rating identification  credit file maintenance  collateral assignment  credit analysis  credit strategies  and action plans 
the former commercial lending officer position will no longer contain those functions and will be solely business development and sales functions 
this will facilitate more timely recognition of changing risks  better allocation of more qualified  specialized individuals to portfolio administration functions  and make for more timely and easier training of staff 
in addition  credit risk officers now report to the chief risk officer  and are separate from the lending function 
a credit risk officer has been named the credit department manager with primary responsibility to support portfolio managers with all underwritings of credits through a team of credit analysts 
the position of chief of community banking has been created and filled  to provide greater consistency and oversight of the commercial related loan administration at all four bank subsidiaries 
new board members have been added at nbg and bnb  and the board level compliance committees at these respective banks have been reorganized to better manage and monitor compliance with the formal agreements 
the level for risk grading decisions requiring review and approval by the credit risk officers on commercial loans has been decreased to loans greater than  in addition  all commercial loans greater than  which meet certain other criteria  now must be reviewed annually by credit risk 
table of contents officers 
in addition  the company s centralized credit administration function recently completed a special review of loan files and loan risk grades for approximately of the company s commercial loan portfolio 
procedures are being written to provide for better documentation of the subjective factors incorporated in the calculation of the allowance for loan losses 
the company for many years has operated under a decentralized  super community bank business model  with four largely autonomous subsidiary banks whose boards and management have the authority to operate the banks within guidelines set forth in broad corporate policies established at the holding company level 
the board has evaluated the effectiveness of this model and believes that changes to the company s governance structure may enhance its performance 
the board is evaluating whether consolidating one or more of the company s four banks would result in more effective management of its operations and capital at both the bank and holding company levels 
the company has also been assessing its strategies for reducing the current levels of criticized and classified loans 
realizations of improvements from these strategies will require a considerable period of time 
the company is exploring a more immediate strategy  the potential sale of a substantial portion of these loans  and has retained an investment banker as an advisor to provide a review and assessment of those loans 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and are consistent with predominant practices in the financial services industry 
application of critical accounting policies  which are those policies that management believes are the most important to the company s financial position and results  requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
future changes in information may affect these estimates  assumptions and judgments  which  in turn  may affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
the company has numerous accounting policies  of which the most significant are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses are reported in the consolidated financial statements and how those reported amounts are determined 
based on the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has determined that the accounting policies with respect to the allowance for loan losses and goodwill require particularly subjective or complex judgments important to the company s financial position and results of operations  and  as such  are considered to be critical accounting policies as discussed below 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of subjective measurements including management s assessment of the internal risk classifications of loans  changes in the nature of the loan portfolio  industry concentrations and the impact of current local  regional and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations or liquidity

goodwill statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets prescribes the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to initial recognition

instead  these assets are subject to at least an annual impairment review  and more frequently if certain impairment indicators are in evidence

as of december   residential real estate loans totaled million or of the portfolio  a increase from million or of total loans in the increase in residential real estate loans is due to an increase in closed end home equity loans  as the company sells most qualifying newly originated and refinanced residential real estate mortgages on the secondary market 
the sold and serviced residential real estate loan portfolio increased to million at december  from million at december  the company also offers a broad range of consumer loan products 
consumer and open end home equity loans totaled and million at december  and  respectively 
consumer and home equity loans represented of the total loan portfolio at year end the increase in the consumer portfolio is a reflection of the company s efforts to diversify risk in the loan portfolio 
nonaccrual loans and nonperforming assets the following table sets forth information regarding nonaccrual loans and other nonperforming assets at december

loans past due days or more remain on accruing status if they are both well secured and in the process of collection 
nonperforming loans increased to million at december  from million at december  nonaccrual commercial and commercial real estate loans increased in and totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
offsetting the increase in commercial nonaccrual loans was a decline in agricultural nonaccrual loans to million at december  and a decline in restructured loans 
the following table details nonaccrual loan activity for the year ended december dollars in thousands balance at beginning of year additions payments charge offs returned to accruing status transferred to other real estate balance at end of year during  the company received million in payments on nonaccrual loans and million of nonaccrual loans were returned to accruing status 
in addition  the company charged off million in loans that were on nonaccrual status at december  and transferred million in loans to other real estate 
the company has focused considerable resources on working to reduce the level of nonperforming assets in the most cost effective manner 
the company has also made investments in people and processes to provide for a stronger credit and sales culture within the organization 
approximately million or of the million in nonaccrual loans at december  are current with respect to payment of principal and interest 
although these loans are current  the company has classified the loans as nonaccrual because reasonable doubt exists with respect to the future collectibility of principal and interest in accordance with the original contractual terms 
during the year ended december  
table of contents the amount of interest income forgone on nonaccrual loans totaled million and interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis totaled  potential problem loans are loans that are currently performing  but information known about possible credit problems of the borrowers causes management to have doubt as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan payment terms and may result in disclosure of such loans as nonperforming at some time in the future 
management evaluates loans classified as substandard  which continue to accrue interest  to be potential problem loans 
the company identified million and million in loans that continued to accrue interest which were classified as substandard as of december  and  respectively 
these loans remain in a performing status due to a variety of factors  including payment history  the value of collateral supporting the credits  and personal or government guarantees 
the following table summarizes the loan delinquencies excluding past due nonaccrual loans in the loan portfolio as of december  accruing loans days dollars in thousands days or more commercial commercial real estate agricultural residential real estate consumer and home equity total analysis of allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents the estimated amount of probable credit losses in the company s loan portfolio and is established through a charge to earnings 
loans deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are added to the allowance 
amounts are charged off once the probability of loss has been established  with consideration given to such factors as the customer s financial condition  underlying collateral and guarantees  and general and industry economic conditions 
assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses involves substantial uncertainties and is based upon management s evaluation of the amounts required to meet estimated charge offs in the loan portfolio after weighing various factors 
the company performs periodic  systematic reviews of its banks portfolios to identify these probable losses  and to assess the overall collectibility of these portfolios 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is subject to ongoing management review  and the approach taken by management in calculating the allowance is discussed by management with the company s outside auditors and  in the case of nbg and bnb  with the occ 
as of december   management identified a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting related to determining the allowance for loan losses and the provision for loan losses 
additional loan reviews by management late in the fourth quarter of resulted in an increase from september  of approximately million in loans classified as substandard 
in the course of assessing the company s approach to calculating the allowance for loan losses  which was completed last week  management has made certain changes in its approach used in estimating the allowance  which are summarized in the section entitled allocation of allowance for loan losses 
based on this analysis  the company believes that the allowance for loan losses is fairly stated at december  the following table sets forth an analysis of the activity in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended december

the allowance as a percentage of total loans was and at december  and  respectively 
the ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans increased to at december  versus at december  the allowance for loan losses at december  represents the estimated probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on the company s comprehensive assessment

and 
the remaining portfolios of commercial  commercial real estate  agricultural and agricultural real estate loans are segmented into the following loan classification categories uncriticized or pass graded loans  special mention loans  and substandard loans 
the substandard category of loans greater than  is then further divided into two groupings based on an assessment of the individual loan s collateralization levels ie under collateralized or adequately collateralized 
loans under collateralized by less than of the outstanding loan balance are treated the same as adequately collateralized loans 
those accruing substandard loans where the collateral deficiency is greater than are split into loans with outstanding loan balances of million or more and loans with outstanding loan balance under million 
the inherent risk of loss in each of these two groupings of loans is estimated based upon historical net loan charge off considerations  review of the amount of under collateralization of the loans in the respective groupings  as well as other qualitative factors 
previous to the fourth quarter of these groups of loans were considered in the aggregate with all substandard loans as described in the following paragraph related to adequately collateralized substandard loans 
uncritized loans  special mention loans  adequately collateralized substandard loans and all substandard loans under  are assigned allowance allocations based on historical net loan charge off experience for each of the respective loan categories over the previous two years  supplemented with additional reserve amounts  if considered necessary  based upon qualitative factors 
these qualitative factors include the levels and trends in delinquencies  nonaccrual loans  and risk ratings  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of changes in lending policy  experience  ability  and depth of management  national and local economic conditions  and concentrations of credit 
the consumer loan portfolio is segmented into six types of loans residential mortgages  home equity  consumer direct  consumer indirect  personal lines of credit  and student loans 
each of those categories is 
table of contents subdivided into categories based on delinquency status  either days and over past due or under days 
allowance allocations on these types of loans are based on the average loss experience over the last three years for each subdivision of delinquency status supplemented with qualitative factors containing the same elements as described above 
a further component of the allowance is the unallocated portion which takes into consideration the inherent risk of loss in the portfolio not identified in the other three categories and includes such elements as risks associated with variances in the rate of historical loss experiences  information risks associated with the dependence upon timely and accurate risk ratings on loans  and risks associated with the dependence on collateral valuation techniques 
while management evaluates currently available information in establishing the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review a financial institution s allowance for loan losses and carrying amounts of other real estate owned 
such agencies may require the financial institution to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination loan maturity and repricing schedule the following table sets forth certain information as of december   regarding the amount of loans maturing or repricing in the portfolio 
demand loans having no stated schedule of repayment or maturity and overdrafts are reported as due in one year or less

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the principal objective of the company s interest rate risk management is to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain assets and liabilities  determine the appropriate level of risk to the company given its business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the company s board of directors 
the company s senior management is responsible for reviewing with the board its activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on the net interest margin  the fair value of the portfolio and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on the portfolio and exposure limits 
senior management develops an asset liability policy that meets strategic objectives and regularly reviews the activities of the subsidiary banks 
each subsidiary bank board adopts an asset liability policy within the parameters of the overall fii asset liability policy and utilizes an asset liability committee comprised of senior management of the bank under the direction of the bank s board 
net interest income at risk analysis the primary tool the company uses to manage interest rate risk is a rate shock simulation to measure the rate sensitivity of the balance sheet 
rate shock simulation is a modeling technique used to estimate the impact of changes in rates on net interest income and economic value of equity 
the following table sets forth the results of the modeling analysis at december  change in interest rates in basis points net interest income economic value of equity rate shock amount change change amount change change dollars in thousands static the company measures net interest income at risk by estimating the changes in net interest income resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in interest rates of different magnitudes over a period of months 
as of december   a basis point increase in rates would increase net interest income by million  or  over the next twelve month period 
a basis point decrease in rates would decrease net interest income by million  or  over a twelve month period 
as of december   a basis point increase in rates would decrease the economic value of equity by million  or  over the next twelve month period 
a basis point decrease in rates would decrease the economic value of equity by million  or  over a twelve month period 
this simulation is based on management s assumption as to the effect of interest rate changes on assets and liabilities and assumes a parallel shift of the yield curve 
it also includes certain assumptions about the future pricing of loans and deposits in response to changes in interest rates 
further  it assumes that delinquency rates would not change as a result of changes in interest rates  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
while this simulation is a useful measure as to net interest income at risk due to a change in interest rates  it is not a forecast of the future results and is based on many assumptions that  if changed  could cause a different outcome 
in addition to the changes in interest rate scenarios listed above  the company also runs other scenarios to measure interest rate risk  which vary as deemed appropriate as the economic and interest rate environments change 

table of contents gap analysis the following table the gap table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  which management anticipates  based upon certain assumptions  to re price or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which re price or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of the re pricing date or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the table sets forth an approximation of the projected re pricing of assets and liabilities on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments within the selected time intervals 
all non maturity deposits demand deposits and savings deposits are subject to immediate withdrawal and are therefore shown to re price in the period of less than days 
prepayment and re pricing rates can have a significant impact on the estimated gap 
the results shown are based on numerous assumptions and there can be no assurance that the presented results will approximate actual future activity 
december  volumes subject to repricing within non dollars in thousands days days days years years years sensitive total interest earning assets federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits investment securities loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing checking  savings and money market deposits certificates of deposit borrowed funds total interest bearing liabilities period gap cumulative gap period gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets cumulative interest earning assets to cumulative interest bearing liabilities amounts shown include the amortized cost of held to maturity securities and the fair value of available for sale securities 
amounts shown include loans held for sale and are net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs 
amounts shown include junior subordinated debentures 
for purposes of interest rate risk management  the company directs more attention on simulation modeling  such as net interest income at risk as previously discussed  rather than gap analysis 
the net interest income at risk simulation modeling is considered by management to be more informative in forecasting future income at risk
