overview we are a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of airway management products for the anesthesia  respiratory critical care and sleep disorder markets 
we sell our products in over countries worldwide 
we offer one of the broadest single patient use anesthesia and respiratory critical care product lines in the industry and have developed numerous first to market products which are now considered industry standards 
in addition  we sell therapeutic products for patients suffering from sleep disorders and provide sleep disorder diagnoses at sleep labs and centers that we operate 
we also deliver technology services to fda regulated companies 
anesthesia our single patient use anesthesia products and systems are designed to deliver oxygen and anesthesia from a gas source  such as an anesthesia machine  to a patient s pulmonary system  remove anesthetic gases  oxygen and carbon dioxide from a patient and link a patient with various monitors 
our principal anesthesia products consist of face masks  breathing circuits and general anesthesia products 
see item business principal products and services anesthesia 
we also include within this segment the products sold by our thomas medical products subsidiary 
thomas medical is an original equipment manufacturer that primarily manufactures vascular access products for sale to other health care product providers to be used in their products or kits or as a finished product 
revenues in our anesthesia segment are driven primarily by the extent to which our hospital customers perform general surgeries and by the aging of the populations in the geographical markets that we serve 
in addition  because most of our anesthesia products are single use products  we benefit when hospitals undertake programs to reduce the frequency of infections  known as nosocomial infections  which originate or occur within their settings 
revenues in this segment are negatively impacted by the trend among hospitals to allow group purchasing organizations to negotiate long term contracts with medical device manufacturers on their behalf 
see item business sales  marketing and distribution united states sales 
expenses in our anesthesia segment are driven primarily by the cost of raw materials  labor costs and freight expenses 
during recent periods  our petrochemical based raw materials  such as resins  and freight expenses have been impacted by high gas prices  gas shortages and plant shutdowns resulting from hurricane katrina 
in march  we acquired the disposable airway management device business from a subsidiary of baxter international inc for approximately million  including related transaction costs 
this acquisition was structured as an asset purchase pursuant to which we acquired certain manufacturing assets related to the disposable airway management device business valued at approximately million  and inventory  including anesthesia circuits  face masks  heat and moisture exchanger filters and other associated anesthesia components valued at approximately million 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired  which has been allocated to goodwill  was approximately million 
the results of operations of this business  including revenues of approximately million  are included in our results of operations for our anesthesia segment from march  respiratory critical care our primary respiratory critical care products are arterial blood gas syringes and kits  manual resuscitators and blood pressure cuffs 
our respiratory critical care segment responds to the growing needs of hospitals to provide respiratory relief and emergency care 
we believe that in recent years there has been an increasing incidence of respiratory illnesses  such as asthma and emphysema  due in part to an increasingly susceptible aging population  environmental pollution  smoking related illnesses and communicable diseases with significant respiratory impact  such as tuberculosis  hiv and influenza 
these trends  together with concerns regarding the spread of nosocomial infections  drive our sales of respiratory products 
as in our anesthesia segment  revenues in this segment have been negatively impacted by the emergence of group purchasing organizations and expenses in this segment are driven principally by raw materials costs  labor costs and freight expenses 
sleep disorders we serve the sleep disorder market as both a provider of diagnostic services and a manufacturer of therapeutic products focused on sleep disorders 
through our sleep services of america  or ssa  subsidiary  we provide sleep diagnostic testing services in the united states in free standing labs and  through contracts with hospitals  in hospital facilities  for patients suspected of suffering from obstructive sleep apnea 
as of september   we operated sleep centers 
we have focused our efforts on labs and centers affiliated with hospitals  such as johns hopkins and the university of maryland 
our diagnostic services business is driven by the growing awareness of the existence and significant consequences of obstructive sleep apnea 
our principal expense in our sleep diagnostic business is the cost of employing the technicians who operate our sleep labs and centers 
our breas medical ab  or breas  subsidiary is a european manufacturer of personal ventilators for obstructive sleep apnea and long term ventilation 
our sleep disorder products deliver airflow to patients undergoing therapy for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with the objective of increasing patient comfort and acceptance of the treatment 
our sleep disorder products employ continuous positive airway pressure  or cpap  which is a common method for treating obstructive sleep apnea 
we have manufactured and distributed cpap systems for more than a decade 
our sales of sleep disorder and other personal ventilation products have been made principally in international markets 
these sales depend principally on the prevalence of sleep disorders and the acceptance by patients and care givers in developed markets of treatment modalities for obstructive sleep apnea 
like our anesthesia and respiratory critical care businesses  our breas subsidiary faces the challenge of controlling raw material  labor and freight costs 
to date  we have had only limited sales of our sleep disorder products in the united states due in part to the need to obtain regulatory clearance and in part to the dominance by our competitors in selling to home supply dealers 
our united states strategy is to sell these products primarily through our sleep centers 
pharmaceutical technology services we deliver technology services to fda regulated companies primarily in the pharmaceutical sector 
in addition  we also provide services to medical device  diagnostic and biotechnology companies 
we advise clients by helping them establish and monitor processes designed to satisfy their regulatory requirements set forth by the fda and have begun to sell dedicated compliance software to our clients 
we entered the pharmaceutical regulatory services market in and expanded into computer system compliance though our acquisition in of stelex inc this segment benefits from regulatory efforts to systemize compliance by the regulated community and by our clients efforts to control costs through the outsourcing of compliance functions 
our principal costs in this segment are our labor costs 
we also incur technology related expenses as part of our development of compliance software 
net revenues net revenues consist of sales of our anesthesia  respiratory critical care and sleep disorder and personal ventilation products and revenues from our sleep disorder diagnostic services and pharmaceutical technology services 
the amount and percentage of our net revenue derived from each of our business segments was as follows during the periods indicated fiscal year ended september  in thousands net revenue net revenue net revenue anesthesia respiratory critical care sleep disorder and personal ventilation pharmaceutical technology services rebate allowance adjustment total this rebate allowance adjustment relates to our anesthesia and respiratory critical care segments 
see critical accounting policies revenue recognition below 
for all product sales  revenue is recognized when title to the product passes to the customer 
for product sales to all customers except for certain domestic distributors  title passes upon shipment of the product by us 
for sales through certain domestic distributors  title passes when the product is received by that distributor 
gross revenues associated with our anesthesia and respiratory critical care products are reduced by the amount of rebates due on sales to distributors 
see critical accounting policies revenue recognition for a description of how we calculate those rebates 
sales to distributors represented  and of our net sales during the years ended september   and  respectively 
we have provided a reconciliation of gross to net product sales  as well as a comparison with service revenues  below fiscal year ended september  in thousands gross sales rebates other deductions net sales service revenues total net revenues see critical accounting policies revenue recognition for information regarding approaches we have taken in calculating rebates 
other deductions consist of discounts  returns and allowances for credits 
for service revenue in the sleep disorder and pharmaceutical technology services segments  revenue is recognized when the service is performed 
research and development the focus of our research and development efforts  and the amount of such expenses that we incur  vary from year to year and quarter to quarter based on the specific needs of our business 
thus  for example  when changes were required in our sleep disorder and personal ventilation product line during the past two years  of our research and development investment was focused upon our sleep disorder segment in fiscal and of our research and development investment was focused upon that segment in fiscal for fiscal  and  we incurred research and development expenses of million  million and million  respectively 
international sales our products are sold in over countries worldwide 
the table below sets forth our international sales  by segment  for the periods presented fiscal year ended september  in thousands net revenues percent of total revenues net revenues percent of total revenues net revenues percent of total revenues anesthesia respiratory critical care sleep disorder pharmaceutical technology services total for international sales other than in the united kingdom  where we operate a wholly owned distributor  we rely primarily on third party distributors 
commencing in  we sold our anesthesia and respiratory critical care products in nine european and certain other related international markets primarily through a strategic alliance with rusch gmbh  a manufacturer of medical devices 
however  during our fiscal year  rusch s parent company announced its purchase of hudson rci  a competitor of ours in a number of respiratory and anesthesia products 
in light of this acquisition  the parties terminated the distributor agreement  effective as of november  for a period of time we expect to continue to sell through a number of rusch s country specific organizations 
we are simultaneously evaluating alternative distribution methods  including establishing direct distribution channels for some countries and partnering with third party distributors in other countries 
if we are unable to establish new channels promptly and effectively  our international sales of anesthesia and respiratory products may be adversely impacted in fiscal by the termination of our distribution agreement with rusch 
foreign exchange risks our international business exposes us to foreign exchange risks  particularly with respect to our sleep disorder segment and  more particularly  with respect to international sales of our sleep disorder and personal ventilation products by our breas subsidiary 
sales of such products by our breas subsidiary are translated from swedish kroner to united states dollars 
the relative strength of the swedish kroner as compared to the united states dollar  in fiscal and  has resulted in a foreign exchange translation benefit in reporting breas revenue and operating losses 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
acquisitions as part of our growth strategy  we pursue licensing agreements  strategic acquisitions and the purchase of technology 
during the five year period ended september   we made or completed the following acquisitions we acquired a equity interest in breas over a period from june through april breas is engaged in the manufacture and sale of sleep disorder and personal ventilation products 
we acquired a controlling interest in national sleep technologies  inc over a period from june through june in  national sleep technologies merged with a subsidiary of the johns hopkins health system corporation  to form ssa 
we own a equity interest in ssa  which operates our sleep diagnostics business 
the portion of ssa that we do not own is principally owned by johns hopkins and is recorded as a minority interest in our consolidated financial statements 
we acquired a equity interest in stelex in we provide pharmaceutical technology services through this subsidiary in march  we acquired a disposable airway management device business from a subsidiary of baxter international  inc to improve our market share in the anesthesia segment 
these acquisitions have been accounted for as purchases and  accordingly  are included in our consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statement of income data as a percentage of our net revenue

sales of anesthesia products increased by from million for fiscal to million for fiscal this increase was due to volume growth in anesthesia circuits  including a increase in sales of our patented anesthesia circuit  limb 
del o del 
 to million  a increase in sales of traditional anesthesia breathing systems to million resulting from the acquisition of the baxter disposable airway management product line and volume increases in sales of products by our thomas medical products subsidiary 
domestic sales of anesthesia products increased  from million to million 
international sales of anesthesia products increased  from million to million 
respiratory critical care 
sales of respiratory critical care products increased  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  resulting from volume growth in our broselow luten system  cpap and abg product lines  offset by a decline in the domestic sales of our blood pressure cuffs 
we attribute the million increase in sales of our broselow luten system to growing awareness by hospitals of the special risks associated with treating pediatric patients in the emergency room 
domestic sales of respiratory critical care products declined by  from million to million 
international sales of respiratory critical care products increased by from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  reflecting higher sales volumes in our abg and cpap product lines 
sleep disorder 
our sleep disorder segment revenues decreased by from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the percentage decrease would have been but for the impact of favorable foreign exchange rates 
revenues from our diagnostic services decreased by from million for fiscal to million for fiscal in fiscal  our ssa subsidiary closed sleep labs and centers and opened nine new sleep labs and centers 
in the continuing sleep labs and centers  revenue increased from fiscal to fiscal revenues from the sale of sleep disorder and personal ventilation products at our breas subsidiary decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the percentage decrease would have been but for the impact of favorable foreign exchange rates 
during fiscal  a component vendor advised breas that it was unable to deliver a sufficient quantity of a key component at our required specifications 
as a result  breas was unable to bring a new sleep disorder and personal ventilation product line to market in a timely manner 
since we had pre announced the availability of that product line  orders for pre existing products were reduced substantially and the unavailability of the new products negatively affected breas revenues 
limited shipments of the new product line began during the fourth quarter of fiscal we believe that this supply issue has now been adequately resolved 
pharmaceutical technology services 
service revenues in our pharmaceutical technology services segment increased by  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  resulting in part from increased sales of our compliancebuilder software product and in part from increased project work 
the increased project work reflects improved demand from certain new and existing pharmaceutical and medical device clients 
gross profit we have set forth below the dollar amount of our gross profits and our gross profit margins for each of our four segments for the year ended september  dollars in thousands gross profit gross profit margin gross profit gross profit margin anesthesia respiratory critical care sleep disorder pharmaceutical technology services total gross profit dollar improvements in our anesthesia and respiratory critical care segments correspond to the sales volume increases in those segments 
the decline in gross profit margin in the anesthesia segment resulted from the inclusion of the baxter disposable airways product into the sales mix at a lower margin 
the increase in gross profit margin in the respiratory critical care segment was due to the effect of a one time inventory writedown of million in fiscal the gross profit dollar decline in our sleep disorder segment resulted from the sales volume declines in diagnostic services and sleep disorder personal ventilation products  which was offset in part by a cost savings resulting from the closing of poorly performing sleep labs and centers 
the gross profit margin in sleep disorder diagnostic services increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  reflecting our efforts to close these facilities 
the gross profit at breas increased from in fiscal to in fiscal as the sales mix changed to include an increased percentage of higher margin new personal ventilation products 
gross profit dollar improvements of approximately million in our pharmaceutical technology services segment corresponded to the sales volume increase 
gross profit margin for fiscal and remained constant at operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase resulted primarily from increased freight costs resulting from increased sales volumes  the impact of foreign exchange translation at breas  increased compensation cost  increased accounting fees primarily related to sarbanes oxley compliance and increased group purchasing organization fees 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in legal expense and reduced health care costs 
research and development 
research and development expenses were approximately million for both fiscal and fiscal we continue to invest in the development of the new breas family of sleep cpap and personal ventilation equipment  and single use products for anesthesia and respiratory critical care 
restructuring and impairment 
during fiscal  we completed the closure of our california plant and charged million to restructuring expense 
during the fiscal  we recognized a million restructuring charge associated with the closing of our california plant  a reduction in force at our totowa  new jersey headquarters and the closing of the breas sales office in belgium 
other income expense  net 
for fiscal  other net income of million resulted from a litigation settlement  gains on sales of assets and realized foreign exchange gains  offset in part by charitable contributions consisting of product donations

the declines in gross profit dollars and margin in our respiratory critical care segment resulted primarily from sales volume declines and inventory writedowns of million 
in both the anesthesia and respiratory critical care segments  we were impacted by pricing pressures resulting from the membership of our customers in group purchasing organizations 
we experienced a gross profit dollar decline of million in our sleep disorder segment as a result of volume and price reductions at our breas subsidiary 
these declines were more than offset by the cost saving effect of closing poorly performing sleep labs and centers 
the gross profit percentage in our sleep diagnostics business increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  while the gross profit percentage in our breas subsidiary decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the declines in gross profit dollars and margin in our pharmaceutical technology services reflect the decline in service revenues resulting from reduced fda regulatory compliance needs 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the decrease consists primarily of cost reductions  primarily at our breas sales offices and in our pharmaceutical technology services subsidiary  and a reduction in bad debt expense  offset in part by an increase resulting from foreign exchange rate changes 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by approximately million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  as we invested in the development of new products for our breas subsidiary 
restructuring and impairment 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recognized an impairment charge of million relating principally to a chinese distributor based on an evaluation of its business in china 
at that time  we believed that we would be able to renegotiate our agreement with our chinese distributor to preserve some of our business in that country 
in may of  we retained counsel in china to commence certain legal actions against our distributor to collect our accounts receivable  and in the third quarter of fiscal we wrote off all amounts due from this distributor  amounting to million 
in september  we received million in cash from this distributor and we recovered certain inventory 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded that payment as income 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended september   we recognized a million restructuring charge resulting from the closing of our california plant  a reduction in force at our totowa  new jersey headquarters and the closing of the breas sales office in belgium 
other income expense  net 
for fiscal  other income expense  net of million resulted from charitable product donations  costs associated with an acquisition that we did not pursue and severance costs for fiscal  other income expense  net of million consisted primarily of costs of a public offering that we did not pursue  charitable product donations and costs relating to the closing of several redundant sales offices operated by our breas and pharmaceutical technology services subsidiaries 
other items interest income  net

the provision for income tax expense for fiscal and fiscal was million and million  respectively  reflecting effective tax rates of and for these periods  respectively 
we included in the provision for fiscal an additional provision of million resulting from a routine examination by the internal revenue service of our  and federal income tax returns 
also  in fiscal  in order to reflect the results of the irs examination  we re filed certain state tax returns for prior periods  resulting in additional tax expense of million and interest expense of million 
discontinued operations 
on october   we sold the assets of our vital pharma subsidiary to pro clinical  inc we received million in cash and a three year note receivable from proclinical for million 
the note is secured by a first lien against all of the assets sold 
no gain or further loss was recorded on the sale 
on december   we sold certain related real estate 
we have accounted for these sales on a cost recovery basis 
the net loss  after applying the tax benefit  from discontinued operation was approximately million for fiscal and approximately million for fiscal liquidity and capital resources we believe that the funds generated from operations  along with our current working capital position and the net proceeds to be received by vital signs in this offering  will be sufficient to satisfy our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
cash flows historically  our primary liquidity requirements have been to finance business acquisitions and to support operations 
we have funded these requirements primarily through internally generated cash flow 
during fiscal  operating activities provided million of net cash 
investing activities used million of net cash  including million for the acquisition of the baxter disposable airway management product line and capital additions of million

cash and working capital cash and cash equivalents were million at september  as compared to million at september  at september   our working capital was million compared to million at september  at september   the current ratio was to and at september  the current ratio was to debt we have no committed lines of financing 
working capital and capital expenditures our current policy is to retain working capital and earnings for use in our business  subject to the payment of certain cash dividends 
such funds may be used for the buyback of our common stock  business acquisitions  product acquisitions and product development  among other things 
we regularly evaluate and negotiate with domestic and foreign medical device companies regarding potential business or product line acquisitions  licensing arrangements and strategic alliances 
capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately million  and included expenditures for the capitalized costs of software development million  computer hardware and software to upgrade our management information systems million  tools and molding for use at our breas facility million  molds and equipment at both our thomas medical products facility million and our colorado manufacturing plant million  equipment and building improvements at our new jersey facility million and thomas medical products facility million  new laboratory equipment million for our sleep labs  and patents million 
for information regarding capital expenditures by segment  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
dividend and stock buybacks our board of directors had authorized a total expenditure of up to million for the repurchase of our common stock  including the expenditure of million authorized by our board of directors on february  during the past three fiscal years  we repurchased  shares for million  at an average price of per share 
commitments and contingencies the following table sets forth  at september   the amounts of payments due under our operating leases and other long term obligations for the time periods described below payments due by period dollars in thousands contractual obligations total less than one year one year to three years three years to five years more than five years operating leases long term debt capital leases purchase obligations other at september   and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we do not have material relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties other than what is disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies we have identified the following critical accounting principles that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to asset impairment  revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  and contingencies and litigation 
we state these accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements and at relevant places in this discussion and analysis 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting principles affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition net revenues consist of sales of our anesthesia  respiratory critical care and sleep disorder personal ventilation products and revenues from our sleep disorder diagnostic services and pharmaceutical technology services 
for all product sales  revenue is recognized when title to the product passes to the customer 
for product sales to all customers except for certain domestic distributors  title passes upon shipment of the product by us 
for sales through certain domestic distributors  title passes when the product is received by the customer 
for service revenue  revenue is recorded when the service is performed 
our sales to united states distributors are made at our distributor list price 
because the end user ie  a hospital is typically entitled  on a case by case basis  to a price lower than our distributor list price  the distributor is then due a rebate  equal to the difference between the distributor list price and the final lower contract price  when shipment is made to the end user 
in order to properly reflect our sales to distributors  we record the gross sale at our distributor list price  less the amount of the expected rebate  to arrive at the net sale 
this net sale is the amount we expect to receive in cash from the distributor on the sale 
on a monthly basis  each distributor provides us with documentation of shipments to particular end users and computes a rebate claim on such shipments 
once the distributor has provided us with this claim  the distributor will deduct the computed rebate from its net remittance 
the amount of the estimated rebate that has not yet been taken by the distributor through the reduction of a payment is included in the allowance for rebates  which reduces the accounts receivable on our balance sheet 
this allowance is calculated by adding the amount of rebates claimed by the distributors through documentation but not yet reimbursed plus an estimate by us of the amount of future rebates due on any inventory that the distributors are holding at the end of each period 
prior to fiscal  we utilized an historical moving average to estimate the allowance for rebates 
based upon a review that we conducted in fiscal in connection with the preparation of our second quarter financial report  we concluded that the moving average estimate did not necessarily result in the appropriate liability due to the distributor 
accordingly  we changed our method of estimating rebate claims to record the allowance for rebates based upon the documentation provided by the distributor for shipments and inventory not yet shipped 
we also recorded a million expense to increase the amount of our allowance for rebates 
over the years  our information systems have improved 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we concluded that rebates due could be better measured by utilizing current period rebate data to determine an estimated rebate percentage  by distributor and product  and applying that percentage to the current period gross sales by distributor and product 
we believe that there was no material financial statement impact between our current approach and the approach we adopted in fiscal the allowance for rebates was million and million at september  and september   respectively 
rebate expense was million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
amortization of goodwill through september   we amortized goodwill and intangibles on a straight line basis over their estimated lives 
upon our adoption of sfas no 
on october   we ceased amortizing goodwill and we perform an annual impairment analysis based upon discounted cash flows to assess the recoverability of the goodwill  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we last completed this impairment test during the three month period ended march  and found no impairment 
we also review the carrying value of other long lived assets on a periodic basis  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the amounts may not be recoverable 
if we determine that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  we then estimate the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
we will recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of those assets 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
we have not incurred material impairment charges since fiscal if we are required to record impairment charges in the future  it would have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
goodwill amounted to million at september  and million at september  allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which results in bad debt expense 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million at september  and million at september  we determine the adequacy of this allowance by evaluating individual customer receivables  considering the customer s financial condition and credit history and analyzing current economic conditions

claims and proceedings we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business
