item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business the company is engaged in providing pressure pumping services and other oilfield services to the oil and natural gas industry worldwide 
services are provided through three segments us mexico pressure pumping  international pressure pumping  and other oilfield services 
the us mexico and international pressure pumping segments provide stimulation and cementing services to the petroleum industry throughout the world 
stimulation services are designed to improve the flow of oil and natural gas from producing formations 
cementing services consists of pumping a cement slurry into a well between the casing and the wellbore to isolate fluids that might otherwise damage the casing and or affect productivity  or that could migrate to different zones  primarily during the drilling and completion phase of a well 
see business included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for more information on these operations 
the other oilfield services segment consists of production chemical services  casing and tubular services  process and pipeline services  and completion tools and completion fluids services in the us and select markets internationally 
investigations regarding misappropriation and possible illegal payments in october the company received a report from a whistleblower alleging that its asia pacific region controller had misappropriated company funds in fiscal the company began an internal investigation into the misappropriation and whether other inappropriate actions occurred in the region 
the region controller admitted to multiple misappropriations totaling approximately million during a month period ended april the misappropriations of approximately million were repaid to the company and the region controller s employment was terminated 
although unauthorized  the misappropriations were an expense of the company in the form of theft that were recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in periods prior to april the million repayment represents a gain contingency and was reflected in other income in the consolidated condensed statement of operations for the quarter ended december  in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies 
prior to filing its report on form k for fiscal  the company conducted a review of the asia pacific region s balance sheet and determined that net excess accrued liabilities had accumulated over a period of years which still existed at september  in the amount of million 
based on a comprehensive analysis  the company identified a further million of excess accrued liabilities in the asia pacific region  which were reversed in the fourth quarter of fiscal the following adjustments were recorded in accordance with gaap and company policy in millions gross reduction of other accrued liabilities adjustments of and reclassifications to balance sheet accounts net reduction of excess accruals addition reduction of minority interest liability net increase to income before tax income tax provision total increase to net income the net effect of these adjustments was reported in other income in the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended september  and 
table of contents the company is continuing to investigate whether additional funds were misappropriated beyond the million originally identified and investigate other possible inappropriate actions 
to date  the company has identified an additional million that it believes was stolen by the former region controller 
although unauthorized  the additional million of likely theft was an expense of the company that was recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in periods prior to april as the company continues its investigation  further adjustments may be recorded in the consolidated statements of operations  but no material adjustments are known at this time 
in october  the company also received whistleblower allegations that illegal payments to foreign officials were made in the asia pacific region 
the audit committee of the board of directors engaged independent counsel to conduct a separate investigation to determine whether any such illegal payments were made 
the investigation  which is continuing  has found information indicating a significant likelihood that payments  which may have been illegal  were made to government officials in the asia pacific region aggregating approximately million over several years 
the company has voluntarily disclosed information found in the investigation to the us department of justice doj and us securities and exchange commission sec and is engaged in ongoing discussions with these authorities as they review the matter 
the company and the special investigation by the audit committee are continuing to investigate other payments of approximately million in the asia pacific region beyond those referenced above 
in some cases  the company has not yet been able to establish the legitimacy of the transactions reflected in the underlying documents and in other cases there are questions about the adequacy of the underlying documents to support the accounting entries 
such payments may prove to have been proper  but due to circumstances surrounding the payments  the company continues to investigate to determine whether theft or other improprieties may have been involved 
such payments have been previously expensed  and therefore the company believes that no additional expense is required to be recorded for such payments 
in connection with discussions regarding possible illegal payments in the asia pacific region  us government officials raised a question whether the company had made illegal payments to a contractor or intermediary to obtain business in a country in central asia 
the audit committee is investigating this question 
the company has voluntarily disclosed information found in the investigation to the doj and sec and is engaged in ongoing discussions with these authorities as they review the matter 
the doj  sec and other authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions under the us foreign corrupt practices act and other laws  which they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals in appropriate circumstances including  but not limited to  injunctive relief  disgorgement  fines  penalties and modifications to business practices and compliance programs 
such agencies and authorities have entered into agreements with  and obtained a range of sanctions against  several public corporations and individuals arising from allegations of improper payments and deficiencies in books and records and internal controls  whereby civil and criminal penalties were imposed  including in some cases multi million dollar fines and other sanctions 
we are in discussions with the doj and sec regarding certain of the matters described above 
it is not possible to accurately predict at this time when any of these matters will be resolved 
based on current information  we cannot predict the outcome of such investigations  whether we will reach resolution through such discussions or what  if any  actions may be taken by the doj  sec or other authorities or the effect it may have on our consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in our annual report on form k for the period ended september   the misappropriations and related accounting adjustments in the asia pacific region were possible because of certain internal control operating deficiencies 
during fiscal  the company implemented policy changes worldwide for disbursements 
in march  the company assigned a new controller to the asia pacific region  and enhanced the controller s department 
in addition  we have put in place control and process improvement managers at each of our six regional bases world wide to document  enhance and test our control processes 
the company has also made several enhancements to its accounting policies and procedures 
in the company 
table of contents adopted new policies and procedures for the retention of international commercial agents 
the company is still in the process of reviewing its control policies and procedures and may make further enhancements 
market conditions the company s worldwide operations are primarily driven by the number of oil and natural gas wells being drilled  the depth and drilling conditions of such wells  the number of well completions and the level of workover activity 
drilling activity  in turn  is largely dependent on the price of crude oil and natural gas 
these market factors often lead to volatility in the company s revenue and profitability  especially in the united states and canada  where the company historically has generated in excess of of its revenue 
historical market conditions are reflected in the table below for the twelve months ended september change change rig count us international commodity prices average crude oil west texas intermediate natural gas henry hub estimate of drilling activity as measured by average active drilling rigs based on baker hughes incorporated rig count information 
includes mexico average rig count of  and for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
us rig count demand for the company s pressure pumping services in the us is primarily driven by oil and natural gas drilling activity  which tends to be extremely volatile  depending on the current and anticipated prices of oil and natural gas 
during the last years  the lowest us rig count averaged in fiscal and the highest us rig count averaged  in fiscal international rig count many countries in which we operate are subject to political  social and economic risks which may cause volatility within any given country 
however  operating in approximately countries provides some protection against volatility risk of individual countries 
due to the significant investment and complexity of international projects  management believes drilling decisions relating to such projects tend to be evaluated and monitored with a longer term perspective with regard to oil and natural gas pricing 
additionally  the international market is dominated by major oil companies and national oil companies which tend to have different objectives and more operating stability than the typical independent producer in north america 
during the last years  the lowest international rig count including canada averaged in fiscal and the highest international rig count averaged  in fiscal during fiscal  active international drilling rigs excluding canada drilling activity averaged  compared to rigs in fiscal and rigs in fiscal canadian drilling activity averaged active drilling rigs in fiscal  compared to rigs in fiscal and rigs in fiscal acquisitions on november   the company completed the acquisition of cajun tubular services  inc cajun for a total purchase price of million net of cash 
cajun  located in lafayette  louisiana  provides tubular running  testing and torque monitoring services to the gulf of mexico market 
this business complements the company s casing and tubular services business in the other oilfield services segment 
on december   the company acquired the assets and business of petro drive  a division of grant prideco  inc  for a total purchase price of million 
petro drive  located in lafayette  louisiana  is a leading 
table of contents provider of hydraulic and diesel hammer services to the gulf of mexico market and select markets internationally 
this business complements the company s casing and tubular services business in the other oilfield services segment 
these acquisitions resulted in total goodwill of million

results of operations the following table sets forth selected key operating statistics reflecting the company s financial results for the twelve months ended september in millions change change consolidated revenue revenue by business segment us mexico pressure pumping international pressure pumping other oilfield services corporate consolidated operating income operating income loss by business segment us mexico pressure pumping international pressure pumping other oilfield services corporate consolidated revenue and operating income increased drilling activity and pricing improvement in the us and canada along with activity improvements in the middle east and latin america led to the increase in fiscal revenue compared to fiscal the increases experienced in fiscal revenue were slightly offset by revenue decreases in mexico and for our stimulation vessel in the north sea 
fiscal operating income also benefited from the increased revenue described above  but was hindered by the decrease in activity for the stimulation vessel in the north sea 
for fiscal  consolidated operating income margins improved to from reported in fiscal for fiscal  increased drilling activity in the us and canada  pricing improvement in the us and improved revenue from all service lines in the other oilfield services segment were the primary reasons for the increase in revenue compared to fiscal increased activity  international geographic expansion and acquisitions are the primary reasons for the increase in the other oilfield services segment 
these revenue increases were partially offset by activity decreases in some international locations 
fiscal operating income also benefited from the increased revenue described above  but was hindered by activity declines in higher margin locations  decreased pricing and a change in product mix in certain international markets 
for fiscal  consolidated operating income margins improved to from reported in fiscal see discussion below on individual segments for further revenue and operating income variance details 
us mexico pressure pumping segment results for fiscal compared to fiscal increased us drilling activity of from fiscal as well as improved pricing in the us led the increase in revenue 
as of september   approximately of our customers were on the new us price 
table of contents book  which became effective on may  declines in mexico activity reduced revenue for mexico  which slightly offset the gains experienced in the us the decrease in mexico activity  specifically from the burgos area  was caused by our primary customer in mexico curtailing spending on our contract in that area 
the increases in revenue described above  coupled with labor efficiency gains  contributed to the increase in operating income 
labor efficiencies were achieved through an increase in activity without a proportional increase in headcount  thereby increasing employee utilization per job 
the headcount for fiscal increased compared to fiscal  with revenue increasing 
utilization of newer  more efficient and more modern equipment also contributed to the increase in operating income see the business section for information on the us fleet recapitalization initiative 
in addition  the pricing improvement described above directly increased operating income without any associated cost 
as with revenue  the increase in us operating income was slightly offset by the decrease in our mexico operations described above 
results for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in revenue is primarily a result of an increase in the combined us and mexico drilling activity of over fiscal and improved pricing in the us the increase in operating income was primarily due to the increases in revenue described above  coupled with labor efficiency gains 
the headcount for fiscal increased compared to fiscal  with revenue increasing 
outlook the company recently issued a price book increase for its us pressure pumping operations 
the increase averages above the previous price book in the us and was effective november  the degree of customer acceptance of the price book increase will depend on activity levels and competitive pressures 
based on forecasted increase in rig activity and the price book increase discussed above  the company expects revenue to increase in fiscal  compared to fiscal in determining forecasted rig activity  management reviews proprietary projected rig count data provided by a third party and has discussions with customers regarding their expectations for upcoming service requirements 
management analyzes the data obtained and an internal rig count projection is determined 
under normal circumstances and depending on the geographic mix and types of services provided  an increase in rig count will usually result in an increase in the company s revenue 
the company also anticipates increasing headcount approximately in the us during fiscal international pressure pumping segment results for fiscal compared to fiscal the following table summarizes the increase in revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal for each of the operating segments of international pressure pumping change in revenue europe africa middle east asia pacific russia latin america canada canadian  middle eastern  and latin american operations were the primary contributors to the revenue increase 
canadian revenue increased as a result of a increase in activity and improved pricing 
the 
table of contents company issued a new price book for its canadian operation on june  the new price book averaged a increase over the previous price book 
increased fracturing and coiled tubing activity in india and saudi arabia and well control work in bangladesh were major contributions to the increase in the middle east 
average drilling activity in latin america increased compared to fiscal  primarily enhancing revenue in argentina and brazil 
revenue in argentina was up appreciably as a result of increased stimulation and coiled tubing activity 
north sea activity gains in the uk and norway were almost entirely offset by decreased stimulation vessel activity 
throughout fiscal  our primary customer for the vessel experienced delays in its well delivery schedule  resulting in a decline in revenue compared to fiscal improvements in thailand and vietnam were mostly offset by declines in malaysia 
in malaysia  major customers have reduced their drilling and workover programs leading to a revenue decline 
russian revenue increased from the overall market increase 
operating income increased as a result of the improved revenues as described above 
similar to the us mexico pressure pumping segment  labor efficiencies were achieved 
the headcount for fiscal increased compared to fiscal  with revenue increasing 
these operating income increases were partially offset by lower activity levels with the company s stimulation vessel in the north sea 
since there are significant fixed costs associated with operating the stimulation vessel  there was a decline in operating profit 
results for fiscal compared to fiscal the following table summarizes the change in revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal for each of the operating segments of international pressure pumping change in revenue europe africa middle east asia pacific russia latin america canada canadian operations were the primary reason for the increase in revenue 
canadian revenue increased compared to the same period in the prior year  with drilling activity up 
the canadian increase in revenue is attributed to activity related gains of  price improvement of and favorable foreign exchange translation of 
other countries contributing to the revenue increase include russia  india  and the company s stimulation vessel in the north sea 
russia revenue increased from increased stimulation activity  while activity increases in india resulted in a increase in revenue 
these increases in revenue were partially offset by decreased revenue in saudi arabia  norway  nigeria and colombia 
fracturing activity was suspended in saudi arabia during the first four months of fiscal  in addition to pricing pressure 
norway revenue declined as a result of a decrease in coiled tubing activity and a change in the services required by customers 
activity declines in nigeria resulted in a decrease in revenue 
in colombia  major customers have curtailed their drilling programs and  primarily as a result  revenue decreased 
operating income increased as a result of the improved revenues in russia  india and canada described above 
while the weakening us dollar increased canadian revenue  it had minimal impact on operating income as most of our expenses are denominated in canadian dollars 
the increase in operating income from canada is primarily due to the activity increases  which also resulted in improved labor utilization efficiencies 
labor efficiencies were achieved by increasing revenue generated per employee by  compared to the same period in fiscal these operating income increases were mostly offset by the impact of activity declines in saudi arabia  norway  and colombia where the company has historically enjoyed higher margins 
in addition  operating income in africa was negatively impacted  primarily as a result of activity reductions in nigeria from our major customers 
cost reductions in africa and norway and latin america have been initiated to 
table of contents accommodate current activity levels  resulting in restructuring costs incurred in fiscal which did not occur in fiscal this segment also had a decline in operating profit margins due to events causing the stimulation vessel in the north sea to be temporarily idle 
in addition to emergency maintenance experienced during the fourth fiscal quarter of  the customer that contracted for the vessel shut down its operations in the north sea for two months during the quarter ended june  since there are significant fixed costs associated with operating the stimulation vessel  there was a decline in operating profit as a result of these two events in the latter half of fiscal outlook the company issued a price book increase for its canadian pressure pumping operations 
the increase averages above the previous price book in canada and was effective june  the degree of customer acceptance of the price book increase will depend on activity levels and competitive pressures 
compared to levels experienced during fiscal  the company expects revenue in canada to increase and international revenue outside of canada to increase for fiscal the estimated increase is based on forecasted increase in rig activity and the price book increase discussed above 
other oilfield services segment results for fiscal compared to fiscal the following table summarizes the change in revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal for each of the operating segments of other oilfield services change in revenue tubular services process pipeline services chemical services completion tools completion fluids revenue from each service line within other oilfield services increased during fiscal however  the increase in revenue from completion tools was minimal due to severe hurricane activity experienced in the gulf of mexico during the company s fourth fiscal quarter 
this decrease was offset by increases in revenue internationally 
most of the revenue increase in completion fluids was as a result of increased product sales in the us  mexico  and norway 
tubular services revenue benefited from increased activity in the north sea and asia pacific 
fiscal operating income margins were consistent with fiscal for all service lines 
operating income improved for the reasons described above  however  there were additional costs for worker s compensation and write off of uncollectible accounts receivable

table of contents excluding the impact of the cajun and petro drive acquisitions  revenue would have increased in fiscal revenue from each service line within other oilfield services increased during fiscal due to the high oil prices experienced in fiscal compared to prior years  many refineries deferred their maintenance shut downs in until fiscal as a result  process and pipeline services did not perform as many process services in fiscal as in fiscal the increase in the completion tools business line was primarily achieved through an increase in customer activity in the gulf of mexico 
international expansion is the primary reason for the increase in our revenue for the completion fluids and casing and tubular service business lines 
excluding the impact of the cajun and petro drive acquisitions  operating income would have increased in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to completion tools and tubular business lines for the reasons described above 
this increase was partially offset by decreased margins in the process and pipeline service business and the completion fluids business 
the process and pipeline service business had higher margin projects in fiscal  when compared to fiscal while revenue increased in norway from our completion fluids business  this increased activity was in lower margin product sales compared to the prior year 
outlook in fiscal  we expect revenue from other oilfield services to increase from fiscal  primarily attributable to expansion in international markets 
other expenses depreciation expense depreciation expense is included in cost of sales and services on the consolidated statement of operations

second  different estimates that the company reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  must have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as the company s operating environment changes 
materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known  including estimates not deemed critical under the proposed rule by the sec 
the company believes the following are the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the significant judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies 
the selection of accounting estimates  including those deemed critical  and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the audit committee of the board of directors 
the critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with the disclosures elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill the company accounts for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires goodwill to be reviewed for possible impairment using fair value measurement techniques on an annual basis  or if circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist 
specifically  goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its net book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the net book value  no impairment is required and the second step is unnecessary 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the net book value  the second step is performed to determine the amount of the impairment  if any 
fair value measures include quoted market price  present value technique estimate of future cash flows  and a valuation technique based on multiples of earnings or revenue 
the second step compares the implied fair value of a 
table of contents reporting unit with the net book value of the reporting unit 
if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in the amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had just been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
determining fair value and the implied fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of the impairment charge 
the company s estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows 
this approach uses significant assumptions such as a discount rate  growth rate  terminal value multiples  rig count  company price book increases or decreases  and inflation rate 
no impairment adjustment was necessary to the company s million goodwill balance at september  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on goodwill 
pension plans pension expense is determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
in accordance with sfas  the company utilizes an estimated long term rate of return on plan assets and any difference from the actual return is the unrecognized gain loss which is amortized into earnings in future periods 
the company determines the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis using a third party actuary 
in determining the annual estimate of net periodic pension cost  the company is required to make an evaluation of critical assumptions such as discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and expected increase in compensation levels 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
discount rates are based on high quality corporate fixed income investments 
long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of the company s asset allocation and returns being earned by similar investments 
the rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon our historical salary experience 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods  and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense in future periods 
in fiscal  the company will have a pension and postretirement funding requirement of million 
we expect to fund this amount with cash flows from operating activities 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on the company s pension plans 
income taxes the effective income tax rates were   and for the years ended september    and  respectively 
these rates vary primarily due to fluctuations in taxes from the mix of domestic versus foreign income 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the net assets of the company 
in providing for deferred taxes  management considers current tax laws  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
this process also involves making forecasts of current and future years united states taxable income 
unforeseen events and industry conditions may impact these forecasts which in turn can affect the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities and impact our future reported earnings 
our tax filings for various periods are subjected to audit by tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business 
these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts 
resolution of these situations inevitably includes some degree of uncertainty  accordingly  we provide taxes only for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings 
in addition to the aforementioned assessments that have been received from various taxing authorities  we provide for taxes in certain situations where assessments have not been received 
in those situations  we accrue income taxes where we consider it 
table of contents probable that the taxes ultimately payable will exceed those amounts reflected in filed tax returns  accordingly  taxes are provided in those situations under the guidance in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
self insurance accruals and loss contingencies the company is self insured for certain losses relating to workers compensation  general liability  property damage and employee medical benefits for claims filed and claims incurred but not reported 
management reviews the liability on a quarterly basis 
the liability is estimated on an undiscounted basis using individual case based valuations and statistical analysis and is based upon judgment and historical experience  however  the final cost of many of these claims may not be known for five years or longer 
this estimate is subject to trends  such as loss development factors  historical average claim volume  average cost for settled claims and current trends in claim costs 
significant and unanticipated changes in these trends or future actual payouts could result in additional increases or decreases to the recorded accruals 
we have purchased stop loss coverage in order to limit  to the extent feasible  our aggregate exposure to certain claims 
there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect the company against liability from all potential consequences 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against the company 
it is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation pending against the company and litigation is subject to many uncertainties 
it is possible that there could be adverse developments in these cases 
the company records provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss from a loss contingency is significantly different than the estimated loss  our results of operations may be over or understated 
accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  accounting changes and error corrections 
this is a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
under sfas  all voluntary changes in accounting principle as well as changes pursuant to accounting pronouncements that do not include specific transition requirements  must be applied retrospectively to prior periods financial statements 
retrospective application requires the cumulative effect of the change be reflected in the carrying value of assets and liabilities as of the first period presented and the offsetting adjustments are recorded to beginning retained earnings 
each period presented must be adjusted to reflect the period specific effects of applying the change 
also  under the new statement  a change in accounting estimate continues to be accounted for in the period of change and in future periods if necessary 
corrections of errors should continue to be reported by restating prior period financial statements as of the beginning of the first period presented  if material 
the statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company will adopt sfas on october  adoption will not have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations  since sfas is to be applied prospectively 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas r  share based payment 
this is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and supersedes apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
through september   the company has not recorded compensation expense for its stock purchase plan and stock option plan 
under sfas r  the company will be required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock based on the grant date fair value with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period 
the fair value will be estimated using an option pricing model 
excess tax benefits  as defined in sfas r  will be recognized as an addition to paid in capital 
this is effective october  and the company will adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method 

table of contents under the modified prospective method the company will recognize expense beginning october  on any unvested awards granted prior to the adoption date of october  over the remaining vesting period of the awards 
new awards granted after the adoption date will be expensed over the vesting period of the award 
the company currently uses a black scholes option pricing model for disclosures of stock based compensation information and plans on continuing to use this model under sfas r in determining the expense for awards under the stock option plan and the stock purchase plan 
the company has historically expensed the fair value of the awards granted from its stock incentive plan 
adoption of sfas r will require the company to utilize a binomial model to value the stock incentive plan awards 
we do not anticipate the valuation methodology required under sfas r to materially change the compensation expense associated with these awards the company has historically recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
the following table summarizes the impact of the adoption of sfas r for these plans fiscal fiscal fiscal in millions  pre tax plans not currently expensed stock option plan previously unvested grants estimated future grants stock purchase plan estimate additional expense under sfas r plans currently expensed stock incentive plan previously unvested grants estimated future grants director stock awards previously unvested grants estimated future grants total estimated expense estimates of future grants in the table above are based on the level of grants awarded during fiscal the actual number of awards  or the types of awards granted may change 
with respect to the consolidated statement of financial position  this will increase unearned compensation by approximately million and will have an equally offsetting decrease in capital in excess of par in stockholders equity 
for more information regarding these plans  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in october  the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law 
the act contains new provisions that may impact the company s us income tax liability in future years 
the act provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities  which will be phased in from through under the guidance in fasb staff position no 
 application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of  the deduction will be treated as a special deduction as described in fasb statement no 
as such  the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date 
rather  the impact of this deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on our tax return 
we do not expect that this deduction will have a material impact on our effective tax rate in future years 
the act is applicable to the company beginning october  in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fsp  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of  
table of contents which provides guidance under sfas no 
with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the act on a company s income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
fsp states that a company is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas no 
the company is considering the possibility of remitting dividends in excess of million and perhaps materially in excess of million in its next fiscal year to claim the benefits of this new provision 
furthermore  the company believes that any residual us tax liability from this possible repatriation would be fully offset with excess foreign tax credits of the company
