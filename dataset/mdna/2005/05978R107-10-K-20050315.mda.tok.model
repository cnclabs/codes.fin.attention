item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis focuses on information about banctrust financial group  inc and its subsidiaries that is not otherwise apparent from the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes appearing below in this annual report 
reference should be made to those statements and the financial data presented elsewhere in this report for a complete understanding of the following discussion and analysis 
on april   gulf coast community bancshares  inc  the parent company of wewahitchka state bank banktrust of florida  was merged into the company 
on october   banktrust of florida was sold to an unrelated financial institution 
therefore  the results of operations of banktrust of florida have been included as discontinued operations in the consolidated results of the company from april  through october  on december   commercesouth  inc commercesouth the parent company of commercesouth bank alabama now banktrust of alabama and commercesouth bank florida now banktrust  florida was merged into the company 
this merger has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
therefore  the results of operations of these two banks have been included in the consolidated results of the company from december  overview net income for was million compared to million in on a per share basis  basic earnings were in and 
in  and diluted earnings were in and 
in return on average assets in was percent compared to 
percent in total assets at year end were billion compared to billion at year end banktrust of florida had assets of approximately million at the time of its sale on october  management and staff spent considerable time and effort in on the successful integration of commercesouth and banctrust 
a new  comprehensive strategic planning process which began prior to the merger established goals and time frames for the integration process  and for operation of the company for several years to come 
areas addressed in the plan include  but are not limited to internal growth and market expansion  performance goals  credit culture  personnel development  management succession  technology infrastructure to support the overall plan and marketing and product development and enhancement 
the plan is to be periodically monitored and updated by a team of senior officers from all areas of the company 
in the company completed the merger of the demopolis bank and the monroeville bank into the mobile bank 
these mergers were part of a process which was started in to consolidate existing charters and operations 
the mergers were successful and have resulted in reductions in staff as well as the elimination of certain duplicate operations 
in early  following an evaluation of the growth potential of our various markets  we decided to sell our smallest florida bank and we redirected the proceeds of the sale to our higher growth markets in florida 
the transaction was completed on october  we continue to evaluate the feasibility of similar opportunities 
one of the challenges in was funding the rapid loan growth which has occurred in our gulf coast and metropolitan montgomery markets 
loans have grown much faster than core deposits  and the company has placed additional emphasis on non core funding sources such as brokered deposits and federal home loan bank borrowings 
the company expects this trend to continue in in addition to core and non core funding sources  banctrust is exploring the possibility of an equity issuance 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the accounting principles followed by the company and the methods of applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and with general practices within the banking industry 
critical accounting policies relate to the allowance for loan losses 
a description of these policies is as follows allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered by management to be sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
banctrust s determination of its allowance for loan losses is determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards nos 
and the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the amount of the provision charged to expense is based on periodic reviews of the portfolio  past loan loss experience  current and expected economic conditions and such other factors which  in management s judgement  deserve current recognition in estimating loan losses 
a regular  formal and ongoing loan review is conducted to identify loans with unusual risks and probable loss 
management uses the loan review process to stratify the loan portfolio into risk grades 
for higher risk graded loans in the portfolio the banks determine estimated amounts of loss based on several factors  including historical loss experience  management s judgement of economic conditions and the resulting impact on higher risk graded loans  the financial capacity of the borrower  secondary sources of repayment including collateral and regulatory guidelines 
this determination also considers the balance of impaired loans which are generally considered to be non performing loans 
specific allowances for impaired loans are based on comparisons of the recorded carrying values of the loans to the present value of these loans estimated cash flows at each loan s effective interest rate  the fair value of the collateral  or the loan s observable market price 
recovery of the carrying value of loans is dependent to a great extent on economic  operating and other conditions that may be beyond the company s control 
in addition to evaluating probable losses on individual loans  management also determines probable losses for all other loans in the portfolio 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses related to all other loans in the portfolio is determined based on historical and current loss experience  portfolio mix by loan type and by collateral type  current economic conditions  the level and trend of loan quality ratios  and such other factors which  in management s judgement  deserve current recognition in estimating inherent loan losses 
the methodology and assumptions used to determine the allowance are continually reviewed as to their appropriateness given the most recent losses realized and other factors that influence the estimation process 
the model assumptions and resulting allowance level are adjusted accordingly as these factors change

average loans  net  in were million or percent higher than average loans  net  of million in excluding the eufaula and santa rosa beach banks  average loans  increased million 
loan growth was slow during the years through in the markets served by banctrust  however  there was a significant increase in loan demand beginning in  and the demand accelerated in management anticipates that strong loan demand will continue through  especially in the areas of the company along the gulf coast 
average deposits of million in were percent higher than average deposits of million in excluding the eufaula and santa rosa beach banks  average deposits increased million 
short term and long term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased  federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings  a loan from an unrelated commercial bank  overnight repurchase agreements  payable to trust  and 
table of contents deposits in the treasury tax and loan account 
reliance on these funds at the company historically has been low  however  management has recently increased its reliance on these types of funds as loan demand has outpaced deposit growth

the average loan to deposit ratio was percent in compared to percent in and in the loan to deposit ratio of the company at year end rose to percent compared to percent at year end and percent at year end it is management s goal to make loans with relatively short maturities or  in the case of loans with longer maturities  with floating rate arrangements when possible 
of the outstanding loans in the categories of commercial  financial and agricultural  real estate construction and real estate mortgage at december   million  or percent  mature within one year and are therefore subject to interest rate changes  if needed  to adjust for asset liability management purposes 
of the remaining loans in these categories maturing 
table of contents after one year  percent are on a floating rate basis 
of the total loans outstanding in these categories at december   percent are available for repricing within one year  either because the loans mature within one year or because they are based on a variable rate arrangement 
the company makes available to its customers fixed rate  longer term loans  especially in the residential real estate mortgage area 
banctrust is able to offer  through third party arrangements  certain mortgage loan products which do not require that the longer term loans be carried on the books of the company 
these products allow the company to gain the benefit of a larger variety of product offerings and have generated a significant amount of fee income during the recent period of lower mortgage rates 
these fees have come from first and second home purchases as well as significant home refinancing volume 
as interest rates rise  the company expects that the refinancing volume will decrease somewhat  however  first and second home purchase volume is expected to remain strong in our gulf coast markets

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities requires that securities be classified into one of three categories held to maturity  
table of contents available for sale  or trading 
securities classified as held to maturity are stated at amortized cost 
this classification means that management has the positive intent  and the company has the ability  to hold the securities until they mature 
securities classified as available for sale are stated at fair value 
securities in this category are held for indefinite periods of time  and include securities that management intends to use as part of its asset liability strategy  or that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates  changes in prepayment risks  changes in liquidity needs  the need to increase regulatory capital or other similar factors 
at december   all of the company s securities were in the available for sale category 
the company holds no trading securities or those classified as held to maturity 
the maturities and weighted average yields of securities available for sale at december   are presented in table at amortized cost using the average stated contractual maturities 
the average stated contractual maturities may differ from the average expected life because of amortized principal payments or because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations 
tax equivalent adjustments  using a percent tax rate  have been made when calculating yields on tax exempt obligations 
included in other investments are equity securities  primarily fhlb stock in the amount of million  which do not mature but are included in the after years category 
mortgage backed securities are shown only in the total as these securities have monthly principal payments

in average deposits grew million  or percent  compared to the commercesouth transaction accounted for million of this increase with the remaining increase  which amounted to a percent increase  resulting from growth in the gulf coast markets of alabama 
the mix of deposits  on average  has not significantly changed over the past few years 
banctrust defines core deposits as total deposits less certificates of deposit of  or more 
core deposits  as a percentage of total deposits  represented percent and percent at year end and respectively 
while the primary emphasis at banctrust remains on attracting and retaining core deposits from customers who will use other products and services offered by the company  management has recognized that  in order to fund loan growth  it is necessary from time to time to pursue non core funding sources such as large certificates of deposit and other borrowed funds more vigorously than in the past 
management has been pursuing such non core funding sources  and this trend is expected to continue in table reflects maturities of time deposits of  or more at december  deposits of million in this category represented percent of total deposits at year end  compared to million representing percent of total deposits at year end 
table of contents short term borrowings include three items federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  which are overnight transactions with large corporate customers  commonly referred to as repos  and other  representing borrowings from the fhlb  from the federal reserve through its discount operations and us treasury tax and loan funds on deposit subject to a note payable to the us treasury department 
the company sold federal funds of million on average during while average short term borrowings were million 
management has sought to control the volume of funds in this category within certain acceptable limits  however  a greater reliance on these types of funds will be necessary in order to fund loan growth in the future

table of contents fhlb advances and long term debt the company uses fhlb advances as an alternative to other funding sources with similar maturities 
they are flexible  allowing the company to quickly obtain the necessary maturities and rates that best suit its overall asset liability management strategy 
fhlb advances totaled million at december   an increase of million from december  of the outstanding fhlb advances at december   million had fixed interest rates and million had a variable interest rate that reprices quarterly 
note to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report  includes additional information relating to outstanding balances  scheduled maturities and rates of fhlb advances 
the company borrowed funds from a trust in to finance a portion of the purchase price of commercesouth  inc the trust was created to issue trust preferred securities which the company is currently allowed by the federal reserve bank to include in the company s calculations of tier i capital 
this payable to trust was million at december  and december  the company does not have the option to repay any amounts of the payable to trust until other long term debt consists of a loan from an unrelated bank to the company 
this loan was incurred in january of to finance a portion of the purchase of commercesouth  inc this loan was million at december  and is secured by a portion of banctrust s stock of the mobile bank 
this loan matures in and requires monthly interest payments 
the company has the option to repay any part of the principal at any time without penalty 
this loan does not require principal payments until the end of the third year  at which time the remaining principal must be amortized over the remaining life of the loan 
asset liability management and liquidity the purpose of asset liability management is to maximize return while minimizing risk 
maximizing return means achieving or exceeding the company s profitability and growth goals 
minimizing risk means managing four key risk factors liquidity  interest rate sensitivity  capital adequacy  and asset quality 
asset liability management at the company involves a comprehensive approach to statement of condition management which meets the risk and return criteria established by management and the board of directors 
to this point  management has not used derivative financial instruments as part of its asset liability management process 
the company s primary market risk is its exposure to interest rate changes 
interest rate risk management strategies are designed to optimize net interest income while minimizing fluctuations caused by changes in the interest rate environment 
it is through these strategies that the company seeks to manage the maturity and repricing characteristics of its statement of condition 
the company uses modeling techniques to simulate net interest income and the impact on fair values of the company s assets and liabilities under various rate scenarios 
important elements of these techniques include the mix of floating versus fixed rate assets and liabilities  and the scheduled  as well as expected  repricing and maturing volumes and rates on the existing statement of condition 
under a scenario simulating a hypothetical basis point rate increase applied to all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the company would expect a net increase in net interest income of million over one year 
under a scenario simulating a hypothetical basis point decrease  the company would expect a net decrease in net interest income of million 
these hypothetical examples are not a precise indicator of future events 
instead  they are reasonable estimates of the results anticipated if the assumptions used in the modeling techniques were to occur 
liquidity represents the ability of a bank to meet loan commitments as well as deposit withdrawals 
liquidity is derived from both the asset side and the liability side of the statement of condition 
on the asset side  liquidity is provided by marketable investment securities  maturing loans  federal funds sold and cash and cash equivalents 
on the liability side  liquidity is provided by a stable base of core deposits 
additionally  the company has available  if needed  federal funds lines of credit and fhlb lines of credit 
the company has an 
table of contents asset liability committee consisting of certain members of management and of the board of directors 
one of the duties of the committee is to monitor the liquidity position of the company and to formulate and implement corrective measures in the event certain liquidity parameters are exceeded 
contractual obligations tables and present information about the company s contractual obligations  which by their terms are not short term  and commitments at december  table contractual obligations in thousands one year or less over one year through five years over five years total fhlb advances and long term debt operating leases certificates of deposit total refer to note  federal home loan bank advances and long term debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about these obligations  including certain redemption features 
table commitments in thousands one year or less over one year through five years over five years total lines of credit unused standby letters of credit total interest rate sensitivity by monitoring the company s interest rate sensitivity  management attempts to maintain a desired balance between the growth of net interest revenue and the risks that might result from significant changes in interest rates in the market 
one tool for measurement of this risk is gap analysis  whereby the repricing of assets and liabilities is compared within certain time categories 
by identifying mismatches in repricing opportunities within a time category  interest rate risk can be identified 
the interest sensitivity analysis presented in table is based on this type of gap analysis  which assumes that rates earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities will move simultaneously in the same direction and to the same extent 
however  the rates associated with these assets and liabilities actually change at different times and in varying amounts 
changes in the composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can increase or decrease net interest revenue without affecting interest sensitivity 
the interest rate spread between assets and their corresponding liability can be significantly changed while the repricing interval for both remains unchanged  thus impacting net interest revenue 
over a period of time  net interest revenue can increase or decrease if one side of the statement of condition reprices before the other side 
an interest sensitivity ratio of earning assets divided by interest bearing liabilities  which represents a matched interest sensitive position  does not guarantee maximum net interest revenue 
before investing  management must evaluate several factors  including the general direction of interest rates  in order to determine the type of investment and the maturity needed 
management may  from time to 
table of contents time  accept calculated risks associated with interest sensitivity in an attempt to maximize net interest revenue 
the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate sensitivity 
at december   the company s three month gap position  earning assets divided by interest bearing liabilities  was percent and at twelve months the gap position  on a cumulative basis  was percent  both within the range established by management as acceptable 
the company s three month gap position indicates that  in a period of rising interest rates  each of assets which reprice upward could be followed with in liabilities which could reprice upward within three months 
thus  under this scenario  net interest revenue might increase during the three month period of rising rates  as interest income increases would exceed increases in interest expense 
likewise  over a twelve month period  each of assets which re price upward could be followed by in liabilities which could re price upward  resulting in an increase in net interest revenue 
in a period of falling rates  the opposite effect might occur 
while certain categories are contractually tied to interest rate movements  most are subject only to competitive pressures and do not necessarily reprice directly with changes in market rates 
management has a certain amount of flexibility when adjusting rates on these products  therefore the repricing of assets and liabilities would not necessarily take place at the same time and in the same amounts

certain types of savings accounts are included in the non interest sensitive within years category 
in management s opinion  these liabilities do not reprice in the same proportions as rate sensitive assets  as they are not responsive to general interest rate changes in the economy 

table of contents capital resources tangible shareholders equity shareholders equity less goodwill  other intangible assets and accumulated other comprehensive income was million at december   compared to million at december  at year end  the tier i capital ratio decreased to percent from percent at year end the decrease was due in part to the fact that risk weighted assets from year end to year end increased by percent  whereas total capital grew by only percent 
in december the company formed a trust which issued million of trust preferred securities  the proceeds of which were used to partially finance the purchase of commercesouth 
these securities  for regulatory purposes  are added to tangible common shareholders equity to calculate tier i capital 
the company s leverage ratio  defined as tangible shareholders equity divided by quarterly average assets  was percent at year end compared to percent at december   again a function of the growth in total assets 
the federal reserve and the fdic require that bank holding companies and banks maintain certain minimum levels of capital as defined by risk based capital guidelines 
these guidelines consider risk factors associated with various components of assets  both on and off the statement of condition 
under these guidelines  capital is measured in two tiers  and these capital tiers are used in conjunction with risk based assets in determining risk based capital ratios 
the ratios  expressed as a percentage of total risk adjusted assets  for tier i and total capital were percent and percent  respectively  at december  the company exceeded the minimum risk based capital guidelines at december    and the minimum guidelines are shown on table see capital adequacy on page  regulatory issue on page and note of notes to consolidated financial statements

table of contents results of operations net interest revenue net interest revenue  the difference between amounts earned on assets and the amounts paid on liabilities  is the most significant component of earnings for a financial institution 
changes in interest rates  changes in the volume of assets and liabilities  and changes in the asset liability mix are the major factors that influence net interest revenue 
presented in table is an analysis of net interest revenue  weighted average yields on earning assets and weighted average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities for the past three years 
net yield on interest earning assets is net interest revenue  on a tax equivalent basis  divided by total interest earning assets 
this ratio is a measure of the company s effectiveness in pricing interest earning assets and funding them with both interest bearing and non interest bearing liabilities 
the company s net yield in  on a tax equivalent basis  increased basis points to percent compared to percent in after a rapid decline that began in  interest rates stabilized in  and so did the company s net yield on interest earning assets 
rates began to rise in mid  and the net yield began to increase 
added to the positive effect of rising interest rates on the net interest margin was a large increase in loan volume at the company 
interest rates and loan volume are expected to continue to rise in  and management expects that the company will continue to benefit from a favorable net interest margin 
one possible source of pressure on the net interest margin in is the fact that loans at the company have been growing faster than deposits  and this might cause management to more aggressively price deposits in order to fund loan growth

provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the cost of providing an allowance that is adequate to absorb inherent losses on loans in the portfolio 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a continuous basis by assessing the quality of the loan portfolio and adjusting the allowance when appropriate 
loan review procedures are in place to ensure that potential problem loans are identified 
the procedures include a continuous review of the portfolios at the affiliate banks by the company s loan review department 

table of contents management s evaluation of each loan includes a review of the financial condition and capacity of the borrower  the value of the collateral  current economic trends  historical losses  work out and collection arrangements  and possible concentrations of credit 
the loan review process also includes an evaluation of credit quality within the mortgage and installment loan portfolios 
in establishing the allowance  loss percentages are applied to groups of loans with similar risk characteristics 
these loss percentages are determined by historical experience  portfolio mix  and other economic factors 
each quarter this review is quantified in a report to management which uses it to determine whether an appropriate allowance is maintained 
this report is then submitted to the company s board of directors quarterly 
the amount of the allowance is affected by i loan charge offs  which decrease the allowance  ii recoveries on loans previously charged off  which increase the allowance  and iii the provisions for loan losses charged to income  which increase the allowance
