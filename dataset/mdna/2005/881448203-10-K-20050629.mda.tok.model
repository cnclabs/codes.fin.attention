except as required by applicable law  including the securities laws of the united states  and the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission  we do not plan and assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements contained herein after the date of this report  whether as a result of any new information  future events or otherwise 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following significant accounting policies  among others  affect its judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and allowance for bad debt  derivatives  accounting for income taxes  impairment of long lived assets  stock based compensation  and goodwill 
revenue recognition and allowance for bad debts data center revenues consist of monthly recurring fees for colocation  exchange point  and managed and professional services fees 
it also includes monthly rental income for unimproved space in our miami facility 
revenues from colocation and exchange point services  as well as rental income for unimproved space  are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
installation fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the related contract 
managed and professional services fees are recognized in the period in which the services are provided 
from time to time  we enter into outright sales or sales type lease contracts for technology infrastructure build outs that include procurement  installation and configuration of specialized equipment 
due to the typically short term nature of these types of services  we record revenues under the completed contract method  whereby costs and related amounts are deferred in the balance sheet until services are delivered and accepted by the customer 
contract costs deferred are costs incurred for assets  such as costs for the purchase 
table of contents of materials and production equipment  under fixed price contracts 
for these types of services  labor and other general and administrative costs are not significant and are included as period charges 
pursuant to an outright sale contract  all rights and title to the equipment and infrastructure are purchased 
in connection with an outright sale  we recognize the sale amount as revenue and the cost basis of the equipment and infrastructure is charged to cost of infrastructure build outs 
lease contracts qualifying for capital lease treatment are accounted for as sales type leases 
for sales type lease transactions  we recognize as revenue the net present value of the future minimum lease payments 
the cost basis of the equipment and infrastructure is charged to cost of infrastructure build outs 
during the life of the lease  we recognize as other income in each respective period  that portion of each periodic lease payment deemed to be attributable to interest income 
the balance of each periodic lease payment  representing principal repayment  is recognized as a reduction of capital lease receivable 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from customers 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
we account for data center revenues in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables which provides guidance on separating multiple element revenue arrangements into separate units of accounting 
as of march  and  our accounts receivable amounted to  and  respectively  and were net of allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately  each year 
revenues from construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each contract 
this method is used because management considers costs incurred to be the best measure of progress on these contracts 
the duration of a construction contract generally exceeds one year 
billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are classified as other liabilities and represent billings in excess of revenues recognized 
construction contract expense costs include all direct material and labor costs and indirect costs related to contract performance such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs  bad debt and depreciation 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which losses are determined 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements  may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions can be reasonably estimated 
accordingly  it is possible that our current estimates relating to completion cost and profitability of our uncompleted contracts will vary from actual results 
excluding depreciation  profit margins revenue from construction contract and fees less construction contract expenses on construction contracts for the years ended march   and were   and  respectively 
we analyze current economic news and trends  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating revenue recognition and the adequacy of our allowance for bad debts 
derivatives we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
however  our senior convertible notes due june  contain embedded derivatives that require separate valuation from the notes 
we recognize these derivatives as liabilities on our balance sheet and measure them at their estimated fair value  and recognize changes in their estimated fair value in earnings in the period of change 
we estimated that the embedded derivatives had an initial estimated fair value of approximately  and as of march   an estimated fair value of approximately  the embedded derivatives derive their value primarily based on changes in the price and volatility of our common stock 
the closing price of our common stock decreased to as of march  from per share as of the initial valuation date 
as a result  
table of contents during the year ended march   we recognized a gain of million due to the change in estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives 
with the assistance of a third party we estimate the fair value of our embedded derivatives using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies 
these embedded derivatives derive their value primarily based on changes in the price and volatility of our common stock 
over the life of the notes  given the historical volatility of our common stock  changes in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives are expected to have a material effect on our results of operations 
furthermore  we have estimated the fair value of these embedded derivatives using a theoretical model based on the historical volatility of our common stock of as of march  if an active trading market develops for the notes or we are able to find comparable market data  we may in the future be able to use actual market data to adjust the estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives 
such adjustment could be significant and would be accounted for prospectively 
on december   we paid  to enter into a rate cap protection agreement  a derivative hedge against increases in interest rates 
the agreement caps interest rates on the million mortgage payable for the four year period for which the rate cap protection is in effect 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  a separate component of stockholders equity deficit  and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedge transaction affects earnings 
the portion of the hedge which is not effective is immediately reflected in other income and expenses 
the management will assess  at least quarterly  whether the derivative item is effective in offsetting the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged transaction 
any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness will be recognized in current period earnings 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
accounting for income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we currently have provided for a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
based on the available objective evidence  management does not believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realizable in the future 
should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would benefit net income in the period in which such determination is made 
our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  amounting to approximately million  begin to expire in utilization of the net operating losses generated prior to the amtec merger may be limited by the internal revenue code 
should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination is made 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
such events and circumstances include  but are not limited to  prolonged industry downturns  significant decline in our market value and significant reductions in our projected cash flows 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the 
table of contents preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including long term forecasts of the number of additional customer contracts  profit margins  terminal growth rates and discounted rates 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
as of march  and  our long lived assets  including property and equipment  net and identifiable intangible assets  totaled million and million  respectively 
for the year ended  we recognized impairment charges amounting to approximately million 
stock based compensation the company uses the intrinsic value method to account for its employee stock based compensation plans 
under this method  compensation expense is based on the difference  if any  on the date of grant  between the fair value of the company s shares and the option s exercise price 
the company accounts for stock based compensation to non employees using the fair value method 
as explained under the new accounting pronouncement section of this document  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation which is effective after april  in terremark s case 
management is currently considering the financial accounting  income tax and internal control implications of sfas no 
r 
goodwill goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step approach 
initially the fair values of the reporting units are compared with their carrying amount  including goodwill  to identify potential impairment 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for the excess  if any  of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
as of march  and  our goodwill totaled approximately million 
we performed our annual tests for impairment in the quarters ended march  and  and concluded that there were no impairments 
results of operations results of operations for the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  revenue 
the following charts provide certain information with respect to our revenues for the year ended march  us operations outside us data center construction contract and fee revenue 
table of contents data center revenues consist of for the year ended march  colocation exchange point services managed and professional services other technology infrastructure buildouts total data center revenues the increase in data center revenues was mainly attributable to an increase in our deployed customer base and the completion of three technology infrastructure projects 
the increase in revenues from collocation  exchange point services and managed and professional services was primarily the result of growth in our deployed customer base from customers as of march  to customers as of march  and the increase in mix of data center service revenues derived from managed and professional services from to for the year ended march  and  respectively 
data center revenues consist of colocation services  such as leasing of space and provisioning of power  exchange point services  such as peering and cross connects  managed and professional services  such as network management  network monitoring  other network operating center services  procurement of connectivity  managed router services  and technical support and consulting technology infrastructure build outs which represent turnkey design and installation of technology infrastructure for existing customers 
during the year ended march   we completed three technology infrastructure build outs under us federal government contracts that included the procurement  installation and configuration of specialized equipment at the nap of the americas facility in miami 
under the completed contract method  we recognized approximately million as technology infrastructure build outs revenue upon delivery to  and formal acceptance by  the customer 
as a result  the percentage of data center revenues derived from the us federal government increased to for the year ended march  from for the year ended march  our utilization of total net colocation space increased to as of march  from as of march  our utilization of total net colocation space represents the percentage of space billed versus total space available for customers 
on december   we purchased tecota  the entity that owns the  square feet building in which the nap of the americas is housed 
prior to this acquisition  we leased  square feet of the building 
for comparative purposes  total space available to customers includes our estimate of available space to customers in the entire building for both march  and the increase in exchange point services is mainly due to an increase in cross connects billed to customers 
cross connects billed to customers increased to  as of march  from  as of march  driven by growth in our customer base and in the number of cross connects per customer 
the increase in managed and professional services is mainly due to an increase of approximately million in managed services provided under us federal government contracts 
we anticipate an increase in revenue from colocation exchange point and managed and professional services as we add more customers  sell additional services to existing customers and introduce new products 
table of contents and services 
we anticipate that the percentage of revenue derived from federal government customers will fluctuate depending on the timing of exercise of expansion options under existing contracts and the rate at which we sell additional services to the public sector 
construction contract and fee revenue 
construction contract revenue increased  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  we completed one construction contract in the year ended march   and as of that date  we have no construction contracts in process 
due to our opportunistic approach to our construction business  we expect revenues from construction contracts to significantly fluctuate year to year 
data center operations expenses 
data center operations expenses increased million  to million for the years ended march  from million for the year ended march  data center operations expenses consist mainly of procurement of equipment  rent  operations personnel  property taxes  electricity  chilled water and connectivity and security services 
the increase in total data center operations expenses is mainly due to increases of approximately million related to technology infrastructure build outs  million in personnel costs  million in rent  and million in connectivity costs 
in connection with the three completed technology infrastructure build outs  we incurred million in direct costs  including the purchase of specialized equipment 
under the completed contract method  these contract costs were deferred until our delivery to  and acceptance by  the customer in the quarters ended december  and march  the increase in personnel costs is mainly due to an increase in operations and engineering staff levels 
our staff levels increased to employees as of march  from as of march   which resulted in a million increase in base payroll and relocation expenses of approximately  the increase in employees is mainly attributable to the hiring of personnel with the required security clearances to work under existing and anticipated government contracts 
incentive bonuses expense totaled approximately  during the year ended march  there were no incentive bonuses in the year ended march  the increase in rent expense is mainly due to new leases in brazil and spain and the leasing of additional space in the building where the nap of the americas is housed for nine months ended december  as a result of our december  acquisition of tecota  we will no longer have rent expense related to this facility 
because of the july opening of our facilities in california  we recorded in the year ended march  our first full year of rent expense 
the increase in the procurement of connectivity is due to an increase in services provided by us to the us federal government 
we anticipate that some data center expenses  principally electricity  chilled water  and costs related to managed services will increase as we provide additional services to existing customers and introduce new products and services 
personnel costs will also increase as we continue to increase our team of employees with government security clearances in anticipation of additional us federal government contracts 
construction contract expenses 
construction contract expenses decreased  in the year ended march  to  from  for the year ended march  the increase is proportionately lower than the increase in construction revenues due to better margins 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased million to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the most significant components of the increase in sales and marketing expenses are personnel costs  including sales commissions resulting from increases in staff levels from employees as of march  to employees as of march  and higher commissions resulting from increased revenues 
general and administrative expenses 
excluding non cash stock based compensation charges of million in the year ended march   general and administrative expenses increased million or to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the increase was due to an additional million in consulting and accounting fees  and  in travel expenses

table of contents sarbanes oxley compliance work 
increase in travel expenses is mainly due to increased travel to our facilities in madrid  corvin and sao paulo 
we recognized a non cash  stock based compensation charge of million in the year ended march  in connection with the change in our employment relationship with a former officer 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the increase was due to additions to building and improvements acquired as part of the tecota purchase 
impairment of long lived assets 
during the year ended march   we wrote off  related to equipment that is considered obsolete 
change in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt 
our senior convertible notes due june  contain embedded derivatives that require separate valuation from the senior convertible notes 
we recognize these embedded derivatives as a liability in our balance sheet  measure them at their estimated fair value and recognize changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative instruments in earnings 
we estimated that the embedded derivatives had an initial estimated fair value of approximately  and a march  estimated fair value of approximately  the embedded derivatives derive their value primarily based on changes in the price and volatility of our common stock 
the closing price of our common stock decreased to on march  from per share as of the initial valuation date 
as a result  during the year ended march   we recognized a million gain from the change in estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives 
over the life of the senior convertible notes  given the historical volatility of our common stock  changes in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives are expected to have a material effect on our results of operations 
the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives increases as the price of our common stock increases 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
furthermore  we have estimated the fair value of these embedded derivatives using a theoretical model based on the historical volatility of our common stock of as of march  over the past year 
if a market develops for our senior convertible notes or we are able to find comparable market data  we may be able to use in the future market data to adjust our historical volatility by other factors such as trading volume and our estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives could be significantly different 
any such adjustment would be made prospectively 
during the year ended march   we did not have any embedded derivatives 
gain on debt restructuring and conversion 
during the year ended march   as a result of the extinguishment of notes payable and convertible debentures  we recognized a gain totaling million  representing the recognition of the unamortized balance of a debt restructuring deferred gain and the write off of debt issuance costs  net of an early redemption premium payment 
during the year ended march   we recognized a non cash gain of million related to financing transactions whereby million of our construction payables plus million in accrued interest was converted to  shares of our common stock with a million market value upon conversion 
interest expense 
during the year ended march   interest expense increased  from million for the year ended march  to million for the year ended march  this increase was due to additional debt incurred for the december  acquisition of tecota  partially offset by a decrease in the average interest rate of our borrowings 
net loss 
our net loss decreased from million for the year ended march  to million for the year ended march  the decrease is mainly due to the change in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivative of million for the year ended march  the net loss is primarily the result of insufficient revenues to cover our operating and interest expenses 
we expect to generate net losses until we reach required levels of monthly revenues 

table of contents results of operations for the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  revenue 
the following charts provide certain information with respect to our revenues for the twelve months ended march  revenue us outside us data center construction contract and fee revenue data center revenues consist of for the twelve months ended march  colocation exchange point services managed and professional services contract termination fee data center revenue the increase in data center revenues was primarily the result of growth in our deployed customer base from customers as of march  to customers as of march  data center revenues consist of colocation services  such as leasing of space and provisioning of power  exchange point services  such as peering and cross connects  and managed and professional services  such as network management  network monitoring  procurement and installation of equipment and procurement of connectivity  managed router services  technical support and consulting 
our utilization of total net colocation space increased to as of march  from as of march  our utilization of total net colocation space represents the percentage of space billed versus total space available for customers 
for comparative purposes total space available for customers includes third floor space in the tecota building for both march  and cross connects billed to customers increased to  as of march  from as of march  data center contract termination fee represents amounts received from two customers for the termination of their contracted services with the nap of the americas 
as a result of these contract terminations  we experienced a decrease in monthly recurring revenues of approximately  contract termination fees are recognized upon contract termination when there are no remaining contingencies or obligations on our part 
we anticipate an increase in revenue from colocation  exchange point and managed services as we add more customers to our network of ixs  sell additional services to existing customers and introduce new products and services 
we also expect managed and professional services to become an important source of revenue and increase as a proportion of data center services 

table of contents construction contract and fee revenue decreased million to million for the twelve months ended march  from million for the twelve months ended march  during the twelve months ended march  and  we completed three and eleven construction contracts  respectively 
as of march   we have one construction contract in process 
due to our opportunistic approach to our construction business  we expect revenues from construction contracts to significantly fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we do not expect any revenues from development  commission and construction fees in the foreseeable future 
we anticipate focusing our efforts on obtaining construction contracts for projects related to technology infrastructure 
data center operations expenses 
data center operations expenses increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended march  from million for the twelve months ended march  data center operations expenses consist mainly of rent  operations personnel  property taxes  electricity  chilled water  procurement of equipment and connectivity and security services

the increase in rent expense is due to the july opening of our nap west facilities in santa clara  california and the leasing of an additional  square feet of space in the third floor of the tecota building  which commenced in november we have been paying rent for our nap west facilities since january but before we opened these facilities in july  related expenses were recorded as impairment charges 
the increase in personnel costs is mainly attributable to staff increase from operations employees in fiscal year to for fiscal year we anticipate that some data center expenses  principally electricity  chilled water  payroll and costs related to managed services  will increase as we provide additional services to existing customers and introduce new products and services 
contract construction expenses 
contract construction expenses decreased approximately million to  for the twelve months ended march  from million for the twelve months ended march  this decrease is a result of the decrease in number of construction contracts and average dollar amount of those contracts as discussed above in construction contract revenue 
we do not currently anticipate losses on any of the individual construction contracts 
general and administrative expense 
excluding non cash charges of million for stock based compensation  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended march  from million for the twelve months ended march  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  professional service fees  rent and other general corporate expenses 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses is due to a decrease in payroll of  in connection with the modification to our employment relationship with three employees  we accelerated the vesting on their outstanding stock options  awarded new stock options and or extended the life of their outstanding stock options 
as a result  we recognized a non cash  stock based compensation charge of approximately million in the year ended march  the decrease in payroll is mainly due to a reduction in staff levels

the decrease in payroll is mainly due to staff level reductions 
the number of employees whose salaries are included in sales and marketing expenses were and as of march  and  respectively 
the decrease in travel and entertainment is the result of overall reduction in spending due to cost containment efforts 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased  to million for the twelve months ended march  from million for the twelve months ended march  the decrease was due to reductions in property and equipment resulting primarily from impairment charges recorded during the year ended march   which in turn decreased depreciation expense 
impairment of long lived assets 
during the three months ended march   we performed our annual test for impairment and concluded that these assets were not impaired 
due principally to the decline and uncertainty of the telecommunications and internet infrastructure markets  we recognized during the year ended march  the following impairment charges facility in santa clara  california post shell goodwill tecota promote interest equipment as a result of impairment charges  the long lived assets described in the table above became fully impaired 
debt restructuring 
during the twelve months ended march   we incurred a non cash gain of million related to financing transactions whereby million of our construction payables plus million in accrued interest was converted to million shares of our common stock with a million market value upon conversion 
interest expense 
excluding non cash charges  interest expense decreased to million from million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
we reduced the interest expense as a result of a reduction in the principal balance outstanding and a reduction in the interest rates 
due to the conversion of some of our debt and construction payables to equity which was partially offset by the issuance of new debt  our principal balance outstanding decreased to million from million as of march  and  respectively 
in addition our average interest rate on our debt decreased to from for the years ended march  and  respectively 
net non cash charges of approximately million represent the amortization of a beneficial conversion feature as additional interest expense partially offset by the amortization of a debt restructuring gain as reductions to interest expense 
other income expenses 
on november   a developer agreed to pay us a million non refundable fee to develop a facility in australia 
the developer paid us  upon execution of the agreement and the remaining balance of million on december  on february   the developer notified us it did not wish to proceed with negotiations regarding the construction of a terrenap center in australia 
on february   we acknowledged receipt of the developer s notification  and terminated the agreement with the developer 
as required by the agreement  we did not conduct any business related to the operation or management of data centers in australia until the agreement was terminated 
we have no further obligations in connection with the agreement with the developer and as a result recognized the million non refundable fee in the quarter ended march  net loss 
net loss for our reportable segments decreased from million to million primarily because we were unable to generate sufficient revenues to cover our operating and interest expenses 
we expect to generate net losses until we reach required levels of monthly revenues liquidity and capital resources liquidity and recent developments on march   we sold  shares of our common stock at per share through an underwritten public offering 
we received net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses 
we have been and intend to 
table of contents continue using the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes to support the growth of our business  which may include capital investments to build out our existing facilities and potential acquisitions of complementary businesses 
on december   we purchased the remaining equity interests of tecota that were not owned by us and tecota became our wholly owned subsidiary 
tecota owns the building in which the nap of the americas is housed 
throughout this report  we refer to this building as the nap of the americas building 
in connection with this purchase  we paid approximately million for the equity interests and repaid an approximately million mortgage to which the nap of the americas building was subject 
we financed the purchase and repayment of the mortgage from two sources 
we obtained a million first mortgage loan from citigroup global markets realty corp  million of the proceeds of which are restricted and can only be used to fund customer related improvements made to the nap of the americas in miami 
simultaneously  we issued senior secured notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to million and sold  shares of our common stock valued at million to the falcon investors 
the million loan by citigroup is collateralized by a first mortgage on the nap of the americas building and a security interest in all then existing building improvements that we have made to the building  certain of our deposit accounts and any cash flows generated from customers by virtue of their activity at the nap of the americas building 
the mortgage loan matures in february and bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of a and b libor plus 
in addition  if an event of default occurs under the mortgage loan agreement  we must pay interest at a default rate equal to per annum in excess of the rate otherwise applicable under the mortgage loan agreement on any amount we owe to the lenders but have not paid when due until that amount is paid in full 
the terms of the mortgage loan agreement require us to pay annual rent of  to tecota until may  at which time we will be required to pay annual rent to tecota at previously agreed upon rental rates for the remaining term of the lease 
the senior secured notes are collateralized by substantially all of our assets other than the nap of the americas building  including the equity interests in our subsidiaries  bear cash interest at per annum and payment in kind interest at per annum  and mature in march in the event we achieve specified leverage ratios  the interest rate applicable to the senior secured notes will be reduced to but will be payable in cash only 
overdue payments under the senior secured notes bear interest at a default rate equal to per annum in excess of the rate of interest then borne by the senior secured notes 
our obligations under the senior secured notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries 
we may redeem some or all of the senior secured notes for cash at any time after december  if we redeem the notes during the twelve month period commencing on december  or the six month period commencing on december   june   or december   the redemption price equals    and  respectively  of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the redemption date 
after june   the redemption price equals of their principal amounts 
also  if there is a change in control  the holders of these notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
our new mortgage loan and our senior secured notes include numerous covenants imposing significant financial and operating restrictions on our business 
the covenants place restrictions on our ability to  among other things incur more debt  pay dividends  redeem or repurchase our stock or make other distributions  make acquisitions or investments  enter into transactions with affiliates  merge or consolidate with others  dispose of assets or use asset sale proceeds  
table of contents create liens on our assets  and extend credit 
also  a change in control without the prior consent of the lenders could allow the lenders to demand repayment of the loan 
our ability to comply with these and other provisions of the new mortgage loan and the senior secured notes can be affected by events beyond our control 
our failure to comply with the obligations in the new mortgage loan and the senior secured notes could result in an event of default under the new mortgage loan and the senior secured notes  which  if not cured or waived  could permit acceleration of the indebtedness or other indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on us 
in june  we privately placed million in aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due june  to qualified institutional buyers 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually  on each december and june and are convertible at the option of the holders at per share 
we utilized net proceeds of million to pay approximately million of outstanding loans and convertible debt 
the balance of the proceeds will be used for possible acquisitions and for general corporate purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures 
the notes rank pari passu with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness  senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness  and rank junior to any future secured indebtedness 
if there is a change in control  the holders of the senior convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
if a change of control occurs and at least of the consideration for our common stock consists of cash  the holders of the senior convertible notes may elect to receive the greater of the repurchase price described above or the total redemption amount 
the total redemption amount will be equal to the product of x the average closing prices of our common stock for the five trading days prior to the announcement of the change of control and y the quotient of  divided by the applicable conversion price of the senior convertible notes  plus a make whole premium of per  of principal if the change of control takes place before december   reducing to per  of principal if the change of control takes place between june  and december  if we issue a cash dividend on our common stock  we will pay contingent interest to the holders equal to the product of the per share cash dividend and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of each holder s note 
we may redeem some or all of the senior convertible notes for cash at any time on or after june  if the closing price of our common shares has exceeded of the applicable conversion price for at least trading days within a period of consecutive trading days ending on the trading day before the date we mail the redemption notice 
if we redeem the senior convertible notes during the twelve month period commencing on june  or  the redemption price equals or  respectively  of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the redemption date  plus an amount equal to of all remaining scheduled interest payments on the senior convertible notes from  and including  the redemption date through the maturity date 
the senior convertible notes contain an early conversion incentive for holders to convert their notes into shares of common stock before june  if exercised  the holders will receive the number of shares of our common stock to which they are entitled and an early conversion incentive payment in cash or stock  at our option  equal to one half the aggregate amount of interest payable through july  we have incurred losses from operations in each quarter and annual period since our merger with amtec  inc our cash flows from operations for the years ended march  and were negative 
as of march   our total liabilities were approximately million 
due to the issuance of additional debt and equity  our working capital increased from a million deficit  as of march   to a million surplus  as of march  as of march   our principal source of liquidity was our million in cash and cash equivalents 
we anticipate that this cash  coupled with our anticipated cash flows generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditures  working capital  debt service and corporate overhead requirements in connection with our currently identified business objectives 
our projected revenues and cash flows depend 
table of contents on several factors  some of which are beyond our control  including the rate at which we provide services  the timing of exercise of expansion options by customers under existing contracts  the rate at which new services are sold to the government sector and the commercial sector  the ability to retain the customer base  the willingness and timing of potential customers in outsourcing the housing and management of their technology infrastructure to us  the reliability and cost effectiveness of our services and our ability to market our services 
sources and uses of cash cash used in operations for the year ended march  was approximately million compared to cash used in operations of million for the year ended march   an increase of approximately million 
the increase in cash used in operations is mainly due to providing financing in to the us government for certain technology infrastructure buildouts and to the payment of additional interest as a result of additional financing for the tecota acquisition 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended march  was million compared to cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended march   an increase of million 
this increase is primarily due to the acquisitions of tecota and nap madrid and purchases of property and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended march  was million compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended march   an increase of million 
for the year ended march   cash provided by financing activities includes proceeds aggregating million from our new mortgage loan  our senior secured notes  our senior convertible notes  and the issuance of stock  partially offset by million in payments for loans and convertible debt 
for the year ended march   cash provided by financing activities included million of debt and equity financing  partially offset by million in debt repayments

we lease space for our operations  office equipment and furniture under non cancelable operating leases 
some equipment is also leased under capital leases  which are included in leasehold improvements  furniture and equipment 
the following table represents the minimum future operating and capital lease payments for these commitments  as well as the combined aggregate maturities for the following obligations for each of the twelve months ended capital lease obligations operating leases convertible debt mortgage payable notes payable total thereafter as required by the terms of the madrid lease agreement  we have obtained a five year bank guarantee in favor of the lessor in an amount equal to the annual rent payments

new accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
which deferred the measurement provisions of sfas no 
indefinitely for certain mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests that were issued before november  the fasb plans to reconsider implementation issues and  perhaps  classification or measurement guidance for those non controlling interests during the deferral period 
in  we applied certain disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to date  the impact of the effective provisions of sfas no 
has been the presentation of the series h redeemable preferred stock as a liability 
while the effective date of certain elements of sfas no 
has been deferred  the adoption of sfas no 
when finalized is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement revises fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes accounting 
table of contents principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
this statement is effective as of the first reporting period that begins after june  accordingly  we will adopt sfas r in the second quarter of our fiscal year ending march  we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas r and have not yet determined the impact that this statement will have on our results of operations or financial position  however  it may have a significant impact on our consolidated statement of operations as we will be required to expense the fair value of stock option grants and stock purchases under employee stock option plans 
in june  the fasb issued eitf issue the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf issue establishes a common approach to evaluating other than temporary impairment to investments in an effort to reduce the ambiguity in impairment methodology found in apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock and fasb no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  which has resulted in inconsistent application 
in september  the fasb issued fasb staff position eitf issue  which deferred the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance clarified in eitf issue indefinitely  however  the disclosure requirements remain effective for fiscal years ending after june  while the effective date for certain elements of eitf issue have been deferred  the adoption of eitf issue when finalized in its current form is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the emerging issues task force  or eitf  of the fasb approved eitf issue participating securities and the two class method under fas eitf issue supersedes the guidance in topic no 
d  effect of participating convertible securities on the computation of basic earnings per share  and requires the use of the two class method for participating securities 
the two class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings 
in addition  eitf issue addresses other forms of participating securities  including options  warrants  forwards and other contracts to issue an entity s common stock  with the exception of stock based compensation unvested options and restricted stock subject to the provisions of apb opinion no 
and sfas no 
eitf issue is effective for reporting periods beginning after march  and should be applied by restating previously reported earnings per share 
the adoption of eitf issue did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations for the nine months ended december  our senior convertible notes contain contingent interest provisions which allow the holders of the senior convertible notes to participate in any dividends declared on our common stock 
further  our series h and i preferred stock contain participation rights which entitle the holders to receive dividends in the event we declare dividends on our common stock 
accordingly  our senior convertible notes and the series h and i preferred stock are considered participating securities under eitf issue as a result of the number of shares of our common stock currently outstanding  these participating securities are not currently anticipated to have a significant impact on the calculation of earnings per share 
furthermore  these participating securities can only impact the calculation of earnings per share in periods when we present net income 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this report 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  consolidated financial conditions and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business operations 

table of contents we have a history of losses  expect future losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability 
we have incurred net losses from operations in each quarterly and annual period since our april  merger with amtec  inc we incurred net losses of million  million  and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
as of march   our accumulated deficit was million 
we cannot guarantee that we will become profitable 
even if we achieve profitability  given the evolving nature of the industry in which we operate  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis  and our failure to do so would adversely affect our business  including our ability to raise additional funds 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
our products and services must be able to differentiate themselves from existing providers of space and services for telecommunications companies  web hosting companies and other colocation providers 
in addition to competing with neutral colocation providers  we must compete with traditional colocation providers  including local phone companies  long distance phone companies  internet service providers and web hosting facilities 
likewise  with respect to our other products and services  including managed services  bandwidth services and security services  we must compete with more established providers of similar services 
most of these companies have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than us 
because of their greater financial resources  some of our competitors have the ability to adopt aggressive pricing policies  especially if they have been able to restructure their debt or other obligations 
as a result  in the future  we may suffer from pricing pressure that would adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  these competitors could offer colocation on neutral terms  and may start doing so in the same metropolitan areas where we have nap centers 
some of these competitors may also provide our target customers with additional benefits  including bundled communication services  and may do so in a manner that is more attractive to our potential customers than obtaining space in our ibx centers 
we believe our neutrality provides us with an advantage over these competitors 
however  if these competitors were able to adopt aggressive pricing policies together with offering colocation space  our ability to generate revenues would be materially adversely affected 
we may also face competition from persons seeking to replicate our ibx concept by building new centers or converting existing centers that some of our competitors are in the process of divesting 
we may experience competition from our landlords in this regard 
rather than leasing available space in our buildings to large single tenants  they may decide to convert the space instead to smaller square foot units designed for multi tenant colocation use 
landlords may enjoy a cost effective advantage in providing similar services as our naps  and this could also reduce the amount of space available to us for expansion in the future 
competitors may operate more successfully or form alliances to acquire significant market share 
furthermore  enterprises that have already invested substantial resources in outsourcing arrangements may be reluctant or slow to adopt our approach that may replace  limit or compete with their existing systems 
in addition  other companies may be able to attract the same potential customers that we are targeting 
once customers are located in competitors facilities  it may be extremely difficult to convince them to relocate to our nap centers 
our success in retaining key employees and discouraging them from moving to a competitor is an important factor in our ability to remain competitive 
as is common in our industry  our employees are typically compensated through grants of stock options in addition to their regular salaries 
we occasionally grant new stock options to employees as an incentive to remain with us 
if we are unable to adequately maintain these stock option incentives and should employees decide to leave  this may be disruptive to our business and may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we anticipate that an increasing portion of our revenues will be from contracts with agencies of the united states government  and uncertainties in government contracts could adversely affect our business 
during the year ended march   revenues under contracts with agencies of the us federal government constituted of our data center revenues 
generally  us government contracts are subject to 
table of contents oversight audits by government representatives  to profit and cost controls and limitations  and to provisions permitting modification or termination  in whole or in part  without prior notice  at the government s convenience 
in some cases  government contracts are subject to the uncertainties surrounding congressional appropriations or agency funding 
government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations 
failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could lead to suspension or debarment from future government contracting for a period of time  which could limit our growth prospects and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
government contracts typically have an initial term of one year 
renewal periods are exercisable at the discretion of the us government 
we may not be successful in winning contract awards or renewals in the future 
our failure to renew or replace us government contracts when they expire could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a few clients  accordingly  a reduction in our clients demand for our services or the loss of clients would likely impair our financial performance 
during the year ended march   we derived approximately and of our data center revenues from two customers 
during the year ended march   we derived approximately and of our data center revenues from these same two customers 
because we derive a large percentage of our revenues from a few major customers  our revenues could significantly decline if we lose one or more of these customers or if the amount of business we obtain from them is reduced 
see business customers 
we have significant debt service obligations which will require the use of a substantial portion of our available cash 
we are a highly leveraged company 
as of march   our total liabilities were approximately million and our total stockholders equity was million 
our new mortgage loan and our senior secured notes are  collectively  collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
each of these obligations requires significant amounts of liquidity 
should we need additional capital or financing  our ability to arrange financing and the cost of this financing will depend upon many factors  including general economic and capital markets conditions  and in particular the non investment grade debt market  conditions in the internet infrastructure market  credit availability from banks or other lenders  investor confidence in the telecommunications industry generally and our company specifically  and the success of our facilities 
we may be unable to find additional sources of liquidity on terms acceptable to us  if at all  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
also  a default could result in acceleration of our indebtedness 
if this occurs  our business and financial condition would be adversely affected 
the mortgage loan with citigroup and our senior secured notes contain numerous restrictive covenants 
our mortgage loan with citigroup and our senior secured notes contain numerous covenants imposing restrictions on our ability to  among other things incur more debt  pay dividends  redeem or repurchase our stock or make other distributions  make acquisitions or investments  
table of contents enter into transactions with affiliates  merge or consolidate with others  dispose of assets or use asset sale proceeds  create liens on our assets  and extend credit 
our failure to comply with the obligations in our mortgage loan with citigroup and our senior secured notes could result in an event of default under the mortgage loan or the senior secured notes  which  if not cured or waived  could permit acceleration of the indebtedness or our other indebtedness  or result in the same consequences as a default in payment 
if the acceleration of the maturity of our debt occurs  we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it on terms that are acceptable to us  which could adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our substantial leverage and indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition  limit our growth and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to us and may  among other things limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our growth strategy  working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make principal payments and fund debt service requirements  cause us to be unable to satisfy our obligations under our existing or new debt agreements  make us more vulnerable to adverse general economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to compete with others who are not as highly leveraged as we are  and limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business  industry and market conditions 
in addition  subject to restrictions in our existing debt instruments  we may incur additional indebtedness 
if new debt is added to our current debt levels  the related risks that we now face could intensify 
our growth plans and our ability to make payments of principal or interest on  or to refinance  our indebtedness  will depend on our future operating performance and our ability to enter into additional debt and or equity financings 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows in the future to service our debt  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt  to sell assets or to obtain additional financing 
we may not be able to do any of the foregoing on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
although we have not completed our assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that may prevent us from being able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud  which could harm our business and operating results  the trading price of our stock and our access to capital 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and prevent fraud 
in addition  section under the sarbanes oxley act of requires that we assess  and our independent registered public accounting firm attest to  the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
if we cannot provide reliable and accurate financial reports and prevent fraud  our business and operating results could be harmed 
in connection with our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting  which is not complete  we identified material weaknesses  and may discover in the future  areas of our internal control that need improvement 
our efforts regarding internal controls are discussed in detail in this report under item a  controls and procedures 
we cannot be certain that any remedial measures we take will ensure that we design  implement  and maintain adequate controls over our financial 
table of contents processes and reporting in the future or will be sufficient to address and eliminate these material weaknesses 
remedying these material weaknesses that have been identified  and any additional deficiencies  significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that we or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify in the future  could require us to incur additional costs  divert management resources or make other changes 
we have not yet fully remediated the material weaknesses related to maintaining adequate controls to restrict access to key financial applications and data and controls over the custody and processing of disbursements and of customer payments received by mail  and controls over the billing function to ensure that invoices capture all services delivered to customers and that such services are invoiced and recorded accurately as revenue 
if we do not remedy these material weaknesses  we may be required to report in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ending june  or in subsequent reports filed with the securities and exchange commission that material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting continue to exist 
any delay or failure to design and implement new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation or operation  could harm our operating results  cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations  or prevent us from providing reliable and accurate financial reports or avoiding or detecting fraud 
disclosure of our material weaknesses  any failure to remediate such material weaknesses in a timely fashion or having or maintaining ineffective internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital 
if our financial condition deteriorates  we may be delisted by the american stock exchange and our stockholders could find it difficult to sell our common stock 
our common stock currently trades on the american stock exchange  or amex 
the amex requires companies to fulfill specific requirements in order for their shares to continue to be listed 
our securities may be considered for delisting if our financial condition and operating results appear to be unsatisfactory  it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the securities has become so reduced as to make further dealings on the amex inadvisable  or we have sustained losses which are so substantial in relation to our overall operations or our existing financial condition has become so impaired that it appears questionable whether we will be able to continue operations and or meet our obligations as they mature 
if our shares are delisted from the amex  our stockholders could find it difficult to sell our stock 
to date  we have had no communication from the amex regarding delisting 
if our common stock is delisted from the amex  we may apply to have our shares quoted on nasdaq s bulletin board or in the pink sheets maintained by the national quotation bureau  inc the bulletin board and the pink sheets are generally considered to be less efficient markets than the amex 
in addition  if our shares are no longer listed on the amex or another national securities exchange in the united states  our shares may be subject to the penny stock regulations 
if our common stock were to become subject to the penny stock regulations it is likely that the price of our common stock would decline and that our stockholders would find it difficult to sell their shares 
we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our success 
we are highly dependent on the skills  experience and services of key personnel  particularly manuel d 
medina  our chairman  president and chief executive officer 
the loss of mr 
medina or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
our potential growth and expansion are expected to place increased demands on our management skills and resources 
therefore  our success also depends upon our ability to recruit  hire  train and retain additional skilled and experienced management personnel 
employment and retention of qualified personnel is important due to the competitive nature of our industry 
our inability to hire new personnel with the requisite skills could impair our ability to manage and operate our business effectively 

table of contents our business could be harmed by prolonged electrical power outages or shortages  or increased costs of energy 
substantially all of our business is dependent upon the continued operation of the tecota building 
the tecota building and our other ix facilities are susceptible to regional costs of power  electrical power shortages and planned or unplanned power outages caused by these shortages 
a power shortage at an ix facility may result in an increase of the cost of energy  which we may not be able to pass on to our customers 
we attempt to limit exposure to system downtime by using backup generators and power supplies 
power outages  which last beyond our backup and alternative power arrangements  could harm our customers and our business 
we have acquired and may acquire other businesses  and these acquisitions involve numerous risks 
as part of our strategy  we may pursue additional acquisitions of complementary businesses  products services and technologies to enhance our existing services  expand our service offerings and enlarge our customer base 
if we complete future acquisitions  we may be required to incur or assume additional debt and make capital expenditures and issue additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock as consideration  which will dilute our existing stockholders ownership interest and may adversely affect our results of operations 
our ability to grow through acquisitions involves a number of additional risks  including the following the ability to identify and consummate complementary acquisition candidates  the possibility that we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations  personnel  technologies  products and services of the acquired companies in a timely and efficient manner  diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations to negotiate acquisitions and integrate acquired businesses  insufficient revenues to offset significant unforeseen costs and increased expenses associated with the acquisitions  challenges in completing products associated with in process research and development being conducted by the acquired businesses  risks associated with our entrance into markets in which we have little or no prior experience and where competitors have a stronger market presence  deferral of purchasing decisions by current and potential customers as they evaluate the likelihood of success of our acquisitions  issuance by us of equity securities that would dilute ownership of our existing stockholders  incurrence and or assumption of significant debt  contingent liabilities and amortization expenses  and loss of key employees of the acquired companies 
failure to manage effectively our growth through acquisitions could adversely affect our growth prospects  business  results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not entered into any financial instruments for trading purposes 
however  the estimated fair value of the derivatives embedded within our senior convertible notes creates a market risk exposure resulting from changes in the price of our common stock 
these embedded derivatives derive their value primarily based on the price and volatility of our common stock  however  we do not expect significant changes in the near term in the one year historical volatility of our common stock used to calculate the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives 
other factors being equal  as of march   the table below provides information about the estimated fair value of the derivatives embedded within our senior convertible notes and 
table of contents the effect that changes in the price of our common stock are expected to have on the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives estimated fair value of price per share of common stock embedded derivatives our exposure to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates results from the variable rate of our mortgage loan  as an increase in interest rates would result in lower earnings and increased cash outflows 
the interest rate on our mortgage loan is payable at variable rates indexed to libor 
the effect of each increase in the libor rate on our mortgage loan at march  would result in an annual increase in interest expense of approximately  based on the us yield curve as of march  and other available information  we project interest expense on our variable rate debt to increase approximately    and  for the years ended march    and  respectively 
to partially mitigate the interest rate risk on our mortgage loan  we paid  on december  to enter into a rate cap protection agreement 
the rate cap protection agreement capped at the following rates the million mortgage payable for the four year period for which the rate cap protection agreement is in effect per annum  through august   per annum  starting august   per annum  starting february   per annum  starting august   and per annum  starting february  until the termination date of the rate cap protection agreement 
we have designated this interest rate cap agreement as a cash flow hedge 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  a separate component of stockholders equity deficit  and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedge transaction affects earnings 
the portion of the hedge which is not effective is immediately reflected in other income and expenses 
management will assess  at least quarterly  whether the derivative item is effective in offsetting the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged transaction 
any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness will be recognized in current period earnings 
our senior convertible notes and our senior secured notes have fixed interest rates and  accordingly  are not exposed to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates 
however  the fair market value of our long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
these interest rate changes may affect the fair market value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows 
our carrying values of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses are reasonable approximations of their fair value 
as noted above  the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives increases as the price of our common stock increases 
these changes in estimated fair value will affect our results of operations but will not impact our cash flows 

table of contents to date  over of our recognized revenue has been denominated in us dollars  generated mostly from customers in the us  and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations has been minimal 
in the future  a larger portion of our revenues may be derived from operations outside of the us and may be denominated in foreign currency 
as a result  future operating results or cash flows could be impacted due to currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar 
furthermore  to the extent we engage in international sales that are denominated in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our services less competitive in the international markets 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and when appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we cannot conclude that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future 
some of our operating costs are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices 
the commodity most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of significant price change is electricity 
we are closely monitoring the cost of electricity 
to the extent that electricity costs rise  we have the ability to pass these additional power costs onto our customers that utilize this power 
we do not employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge commodity price risk
