item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company  including the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this document 
overview we design  develop  market and support portable  software driven  d measurement systems that are used in a broad range of manufacturing and industrial applications 
our principal products are the faro arm and faro gage articulated arm measuring devices  the faro laser tracker  a laser based measuring device  and their companion cam software  which provide for cad based inspection and factory level statistical process control 
in the first half of  we introduced a new non contact laser probe option for the faro arm 
when sold together  this combination of the faro arm and its laser probe option is called the faro scan arm 
together  all of these products integrate the measurement and quality inspection function with cad software to improve productivity  enhance product quality and decrease rework and scrap in the manufacturing process 
our products bring precision measurement  quality inspection and specification conformance capabilities  integrated with leading cad software  to the factory floor 
we are a pioneer in the development and marketing of d measurement technology in manufacturing and industrial applications and currently hold patents 
our products have been purchased by more than  customers worldwide  ranging from small machine shops to such large manufacturing and industrial companies as audi  bell helicopter  boeing  british aerospace  caterpillar  daimler chrysler  general electric  general motors  honda  johnson controls  komatsu dresser  lockheed martin  siemens and volkswagen among many others 
we continue to pursue international markets 
we established sales offices in france and germany in  great britain in  japan and spain in  italy in  and china in we opened sales offices in south korea and india in the fourth quarter of in we began to manage and report our global sales in three regions the americas  europe africa and asia pacific 
in of our sales were in the americas compared to in  were in the europe africa region compared to in and were in the asia pacific region  compared to in see also note geographic data to the financial statements below 
although we expect variations in the percentage of our sales in the asia pacific region from quarter to quarter going forward  we generally expect higher percentage sales growth in the asia pacific region than the other regions in and as a result of our new sales offices in china  india and south korea  and the addition of sales personnel and the opening of a service center in our japan office 
we also expect to open an asia pacific regional headquarters in singapore in we derive revenues primarily from the sale of our faro arm  faro scan arm  faro gage and faro laser tracker d measurement equipment  and its related multi faceted cam software 
revenue related to these products is recognized upon shipment 
in addition  we sell one and three year extended warranties and training and technology consulting services relating to our products 
we recognize the revenue from extended warranties proportionately  in the same manner as costs are incurred for such revenues 
we also receive royalties from licensing agreements for our historical medical technology and generally recognize the revenue from these royalties as licensees use the technology 
royalties from licensing agreements were   and  in  and  respectively 
in  we began to manufacture our faro arm products in switzerland for customer orders from the europe africa and asia pacific regions 
we began to manufacture our faro gage product  and parts of our faro laser tracker product in our swiss plant in the third quarter of we expect to begin complete production of the faro laser tracker product in our swiss plant in the production of these products for customer orders from the americas will be done in our manufacturing facilities located in florida and pennsylvania 
we expect all our existing plants to have the production capacity necessary to support our growth  at least through cost of sales consists primarily of material  production overhead and labor 
since our ipo in  annual gross margin has been in the range of of sales 
we have established a goal of maintaining target full year ranges in for gross margin between and and operating margin between and 
gross margin for fiscal was within that range at  although gross margin for the fourth quarter of was below that range at partly as a result of a higher proportion of sales coming from demonstration equipment which carry lower margins 
selling expenses as a percentage of sales grew slightly in to compared to in the higher percentage in was due to the addition of new sales personnel in the asia pacific region resulting in higher costs while the additional sales people become fully trained and productive 
we have established a goal of maintaining selling expenses as a percentage of sales at 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries for administrative personnel  rent  utilities and professional and legal expenses 
general and administrative expenses were higher in the second half of due in part to an increase in professional and legal expenses of approximately  directly related to our compliance with sarbanes oxley section regarding internal controls and procedures 
we expect this amount to be approximately  in notwithstanding the expected higher ongoing costs of compliance with new laws and regulations governing public companies in the united states  we expect general and administrative expenses to gradually drop to approximately of sales as higher sales should not require a proportionate increase in these expenses 
research and development expenses represent salaries  equipment and third party services 
we have a commitment to support ongoing research and development and intend to continue to fund these efforts at the level of of sales going forward 
we expect to incur expenses of approximately million in as calculated under the black scholes method of fas  related to our expected adoption of fas r for the expensing of stock options 
we are investigating other valuation methods for these expenses prior to our adoption of fas r 
these expenses will be apportioned according to the employees who have received stock options into cost of sales  selling  general and administrative or research and development costs 
in and we have been able to use previously reserved net operating loss carry forwards  which have reduced our effective tax rate to in and in we have also received a favorable permanent income tax rate commitment from the swiss government as an incentive to establish a manufacturing plant in switzerland 
we are not providing deferred tax assets on temporary differences scheduled to reverse after the commitment period because all of its earnings are included in the current tax provision 
by the second quarter of we expect that approximately of our total shipments will come from the swiss plant 
these shipments will be to europe africa and the asia pacific regions 
as a result we expect the blended consolidated tax rate to be for  and this could fluctuate depending upon  among other things  our ability to use more previously reserved net operating loss carry forwards and the amount of our sales in europe and shipments from our swiss plant 
see critical accounting policies income taxes below 
accounting for wholly owned foreign subsidiaries is maintained in the currency of the respective foreign jurisdiction and  therefore  fluctuations in exchange rates may have an impact on inter company accounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
we are aware of the availability of off balance sheet financial instruments to hedge exposure to foreign currency exchange rates  including cross currency swaps  forward contracts and foreign currency options see foreign exchange exposure below 
however  we do not regularly use such instruments  and none were utilized in or we have had ten consecutive profitable quarters through december  this followed a period of losses in and the first half of  which resulted from an economic slowdown in manufacturing in  and expenses arising from the acquisition in january of spatialmetrix corporation smx 
our sales growth and return to profitability since then was a result of a number of factors including the acquisition of smx  which manufactured the predecessor to the faro laser tracker  the introduction in october of the latest generation of our traditional faro arm product  the introduction of the faro gage in september  the introduction of our faro scan arm product in  and an increase in the number of sales people worldwide 
our worldwide sales and marketing headcount in  and was   and  respectively 
in the third quarter of the company recorded approximately million in other income as a result of receiving approximately  shares of company stock related to a positive arbitration settlement between the company and the former smx shareholders 
on november   we sold  shares of common stock to certain institutional investors in a private placement 
the shares were sold for per share  resulting in total proceeds before placement agent fees and other offering expenses of million 
this transaction significantly increased our cash available for a variety of potential uses including working capital  acquisitions  capital expenditures and our ongoing international expansion

results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods presented  the percentage of sales represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations year ended december  statement of operations data sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling general and administrative depreciation and amortization research and development total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income other income  net interest expense income loss before income taxes income tax expense net income loss compared to sales 
sales increased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for year ended december  this increase resulted from higher unit sales of the faro arm  faro laser tracker and faro gage products  and an overall increase in headcount in sales and marketing of  or from in to in geographically  sales increased million or in the americas  million or in europe africa  and million or in the asia pacific region 
our sales growth is driven to a large extent by the growth in the number of sales people we have 
we expect that new sales people will have a learning curve of months before they are fully functional 
in our sales and marketing headcount increased from to in the americas  from to in europe africa  and from to in the asia pacific region 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  gross margin increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  due to reduced price discounts  reduced service costs as a percentage of sales from in to in  as a result of improvements in product quality and efficiencies in production 
selling expenses 
selling expenses increased by million or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was a result of higher commissions of million  higher salaries and bonuses of million  higher product demonstration costs of million and higher marketing costs of million 
as a percentage of sales  selling expenses increased to of sales in from in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was due to higher salaries and bonuses of million  higher professional and legal fees of  and higher facilities and rent of  partially offset by reduced stock option expense of  general and administrative expenses as percentage of sales fell to of sales in from of sales in in filings prior to form q for the third quarter of we represented the cost of employee stock options as a separate line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
in accordance with sec regulation s x we have eliminated the separate line item for all periods presented  and have included the cost of employee stock options in the appropriate expense category  according to each employee s function 
virtually all of the employees who had stock options that gave rise to an expense were in administration 
as a result  the million in general and administration expenses for reported above is higher than the million previously reported in our form k for by million in employee stock option expense in depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by  or from million for the year ended december  to million in  due to an increase in depreciation of new equipment and capital leases 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by  or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this was due to an increase in salaries and bonuses of  and an increase in external services and other project expenses of  research and development expenses as a percentage of sales were in compared to in interest income expense 
interest income increased by  or from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  primarily from an increase in investments in related to the proceeds from the company s sale of stock in november see also overview above and liquidity and capital resources below 
interest expense decreased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  see liquidity and capital resources below 
other income  net 
other income  net decreased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a settlement of litigation with the former shareholders of smx for million in see also note acquisition and a reduction in foreign exchange gains of  in income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased million from million for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the effective tax rate in was of income before income tax compared to in the primary reason for the lower than expected tax rate was the tax benefit attributable to a reduction in the valuation allowance of approximately million 
of that reduction  million relates to usage of net operating losses in foreign jurisdictions and million of the reduction in the valuation allowance relates to the partial release of the valuation allowance taken in the fourth quarter on foreign deferred tax assets which the company now believes are more likely than not to be realized 
the company determined that the amount of deferred tax assets relating to the net operating loss carryforwards of foreign subsidiaries was understated by approximately million at december  as these net operating loss carryforwards were fully reserved at december  by a valuation allowance  there is no income statement or balance sheet impact to be recognized for the company has million in net deferred tax assets remaining  which will more likely than not be realized in and thereafter if the company remains consistently profitable see also note income taxes 
separate from income tax expenses  the company recorded an addition to shareholders equity of million for the income tax benefit received from the exercise of unqualified stock options by employees 
net income loss 
net income increased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a result of the factors described above 
compared to sales 
sales increased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for year ended december  the increase resulted from higher unit sales of the faro arm and laser tracker products  an increase in headcount in sales and marketing from in to in and from a average price increase on existing products on january  geographically  sales increased million or in the americas  million or in europe africa and million or in the asia pacific region 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  gross margin percentage increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  due to higher selling prices and efficiencies in the faro laser tracker manufacturing plant output 
selling expenses 
selling expenses increased by million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was a result of increased sales head count and higher commissions due to higher sales 
as a percentage of sales  selling expenses dropped to of sales in from in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the increase in professional and legal fees  stock option expense  service charges and network costs 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales fell to of the sales in from of the sales in depreciation and amortization expenses

research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by  or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due primarily to the increased subcontractor costs and materials 
the company has a commitment to spend at least of sales on research and development 
interest income expense 
interest income decreased by  or from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  primarily from lower average investments and lower interest rates in interest expense increased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  due to increased use of a credit line see liquidity and capital resources below

see also note acquisition 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased by  from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the effective tax rate in was of income before income tax 
the primary reason for the relatively low tax rate was a reduction in the valuation allowance of approximately million 
of that reduction  million relates to usage of net operating losses in foreign jurisdictions and million of the reduction in valuation allowance relates to domestic assets for which the company now believes are more likely than not to be realized 
the company has million in deferred tax assets remaining  which may be recognized in if the company remains consistently profitable

net income loss 
the results from operations increased by million from a loss of million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a result of the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources since  the company had financed its operations primarily from cash provided by operating activities and from the proceeds of its initial public offering of common stock approximately million 
on november  the company along with the company s two co founders completed a million private placement of its common stock with various institutional investors 
under the terms of the agreement  the company agreed to sell  shares  or approximately of total shares outstanding  and the two co founders of the company  simon raab and gregory fraser  agreed to sell  shares  or approximately of their holdings  in the aggregate 
the shares were sold for per share  resulting in total proceeds before placement agent fees and other offering expenses of million and million to the company and the co founders  respectively 
on september   the company entered into a loan agreement with suntrust bank for a line of credit of million 
this agreement was renewed and is due to mature on august  the facility bears an interest rate at libor plus 
the company has not drawn on this line of credit 
on january   the company filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission allowing it to raise proceeds of up to million 
the proceeds from any offerings with respect to this registration statement  if any  would be used for either repayment or refinancing of debt  acquisition of additional businesses or technologies or for working capital and general corporate purposes 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million in the million increase reflects growth in net income of million  an increase in income tax benefit from exercise of stock options of million and the absence of million in other income realized in company stock in the settlement of the smx litigation in  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable of million  and deferred income tax benefit of million 
net cash used by investing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in primarily due to a reduction in net investment purchases of million 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million in due to a reduction in the proceeds from issuance of stock of million 
we believe that our working capital  together with anticipated cash flow from our operations  will be sufficient to fund our long term liquidity requirements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company is party to capital leases on automotive and other equipment with an initial term of to months and other non cancelable operating leases  including leases with related parties that expire on or before these obligations are presented below as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total the company enters into purchase commitments for products and services in the ordinary course of business 
these purchases generally cover production requirements for to days 
we do not have any long term commitments for purchases 
critical accounting policies in response to the sec s financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have selected our critical accounting policies for purposes of explaining the methodology used in the calculation in addition to any inherent uncertainties pertaining to the possible effects on our financial condition 
the critical policies discussed below are our processes of recognizing the allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory  the allowance for doubtful accounts  income tax  and the reserve for warranties 
these policies affect current assets and operating results and are therefore critical in assessing our financial and operating status 
these policies involve certain assumptions that  if incorrect  could create an adverse impact on our operations and financial position 
the reserve for obsolescence since the amount of inventoriable cost that we will truly recoup through sales cannot be known with exact certainty  we rely upon both past sales experience and future sales forecasts 
inventory is considered obsolete if we have withdrawn those products from the market or if we had no sales of the product for the past months  and have no sales forecasted for the next months 
accordingly  a reserve in an amount equal to of the average cost of such inventory is recorded in order to reduce the carrying value to net realizable value 
the allowance for doubtful accounts we perform ongoing evaluations of our customers and adjust their credit ratings accordingly 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for un collectible amounts based on its historical experience and any other issues it has identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within its expectations  we cannot guarantee this will continue in the future 
income taxes we review our deferred tax assets on a regular basis to evaluate their recoverability based on projections of the turnaround timing of our deferred tax liabilities  projections of future taxable income  and tax planning strategies that we might employ to utilize such assets  including net operating loss carryforwards 
based on the positive and negative evidence described in financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  we establish a valuation allowance against the net deferred assets of a taxing jurisdiction in which we operate unless it is more likely than not that we will recover such assets through the above means 
in the future  our evaluation of the need for the valuation allowance will be significantly influenced by our ability to achieve profitability and our ability to predict and achieve future projections of taxable income 
the company operates in a number of different countries around the world 
in the company began to manufacture its products in switzerland  where it has received a permanent income tax rate commitment from the swiss government as an incentive to establish a manufacturing plant there 
the company does not provide deferred tax assets on temporary differences scheduled to reverse after the commitment period because all of its earnings are included in the current tax provision 
approximately of all finished goods shipments come from the swiss plant  with the balance coming from the company s manufacturing facilities located in the united states 
significant judgment is required in determine our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
we have appropriately reserved for our tax uncertainties based on the criteria established by sfas  accounting for loss contingencies 
some of the uncertainties arise as a result of inter company arrangements to share revenue and costs 
in such arrangements there are uncertainties about the amount and manner of such sharing  which could ultimately result in changes once the arrangements are reviewed by taxing authorities 
the reserve for warranties the company establishes a liability for included twelve month warranties by the creation of a warranty reserve  which is an estimate of the repair expenses likely to be incurred for the remaining period of warranty measured in installation months in each major product group 
warranty reserve is reflected in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the warranty expense is estimated by determining the total repair expenses for each product group in the period and determining a rate of repair expense per installation month 
the rate is multiplied by the number of machine months of warranty for each product group sold during the period to determine the provision for warranty expenses for the period 
the company reevaluates its exposure to warranty costs at the end of each period using the estimated expense per installation month for each major product group  the number of machines remaining under warranty and the remaining number of months each machine will be under warranty 
while such expenses have historically been within its expectations  we cannot guarantee this will continue in the future 
transactions with related and other parties the company leases its headquarters in lake mary  florida from xenon research  inc  all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of which is owned by simon raab  the company s chief executive officer  and diana raab  his spouse 
the term of the lease expires on february   and the company has a five year renewal option 
base rent under the lease was  for  and base rent during renewal periods will reflect changes in the us bureau of labor statistics consumer price index for all urban consumers 
in may  the company acquired cats gmbh  a german company cats 
on june  the company and each of the former cats shareholders entered into an amended and restated loan agreement pursuant to which the company granted loans to the former cats shareholders in the aggregate amount of million the loans 
the loans outstanding were for a term of three years  at an interest rate of approximately  and granted the borrowers an option to extend the term for an additional three years 
the loans were repaid to the company in the company engaged cole partners  a mergers and acquisition and corporate finance advisory service firm  to serve as the company s financial advisor in connection with the company s acquisition in january of smx 
stephen r 
cole  one of the company s directors and member of the audit committee  is the founding partner and president of cole partners 
the company paid cole partners total fees of  for its services  of which the final payment of  was paid in no fees were paid to cole partners in or foreign exchange exposure we conduct a significant portion of our business outside the united states 
at present  approximately of our revenues are invoiced  and a significant portion of our operating expenses paid  in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition  and could specifically result in foreign exchange gains and losses 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on the results of our operations cannot be accurately predicted 
to the extent that the percentage of our non us dollar revenues derived from international sales increases or decreases in the future  our exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase or decrease 
inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its results of operations in recent years and does not expect inflation to have a material impact on its operations in impact of recently issued accounting standards in january  the fasb issued and subsequently revised in december of  fin  consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
under current practice  two enterprises generally have been included in consolidated financial statements because one enterprise controls the other through voting interests 
fin defines the concept of variable interests and requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse the risks among the parties involved 
fin applied immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applied to the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  fin r deferred the effective date of fin to the first reporting period ending after december  if it is reasonably possible that an enterprise will consolidate or disclose information about a variable interest entity when this interpretation becomes effective  the enterprise shall disclose information about those entities in all financial statements issued after january  fin may be applied prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first applied or by restating previously issued financial statements for one or more years with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated 
in light of current proposed changes to fin  we are continuing our assessment to determine whether we are party to any variable interest entities 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
sfas no 
was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter 
sfas no 
retains the general principle of arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  that inventories are presumed to be stated at cost  however  it amends arb no 
to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facilities  freight  handling costs and spoilage should be recognized as current period expenses 
also  sfas no 
requires fixed overhead costs be allocated to inventories based on normal production capacity 
the guidance in safs no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company believes that implementing sfas no 
will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans to be accounted for under the fair value method  and eliminates the ability to account for these instruments under the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb opinion no 
 as allowed under the original provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
r requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value  which is amortized to expense over the service periods 
the requirements of sfas no 
r are effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  if the company had applied the provisions of sfas no 
to the financial statements for the period ending december   net income would have been reduced by approximately million using the black scholes option pricing model 
we expect to incur expenses of approximately million in as calculated under the black scholes method of sfas  related to our expected adoption of sfas no 
r for the expensing of stock options 
we are investigating other valuation methods for these expenses prior to our adoption of sfas r 
cautionary statements we discuss expectations regarding our future performance and make other forward looking statements in our annual and quarterly reports  press releases and other written and oral statements 
these forward looking statements are based on currently available competitive  financial and economic data and our operating plans 
they are inherently uncertain  and investors must recognize that events could turn out to be significantly different from our expectations 
the following discussion of risks and uncertainties which is not exclusive  highlights some important factors to consider when evaluating our trends and future results 
our customers buying process for our products is highly decentralized  and therefore  it typically requires significant time and expense for us to further penetrate the potential market of a specific customer  which may delay our ability to generate additional revenue 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to further penetrate our customer base 
during  of our revenue was attributable to sales to our existing customers  compared to in if we are not able to continue to penetrate our existing customer base  our sales growth will be impaired 
most of our customers have a decentralized buying process for measurement devices 
thus  we must spend significant time and resources to increase revenues from a specific customer 
for example  we may provide products to only one of our customers manufacturing facilities or for a specific product line within a manufacturing facility 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or increase the amount of sales to our existing customers 
others may develop products that make our products obsolete or less competitive 
the cam market is emerging and could be characterized by rapid technological change 
others may develop new or improved products  processes or technologies that may make our products obsolete or less competitive 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to adapt to evolving markets and technologies or maintain our technological advantage 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to maintain our technological advantage by developing new products and applications and enhancing our existing products 
developing new products and applications and enhancing our existing products can be complex and time consuming and will require substantial investment by us 
significant delays in new product releases or difficulties in developing new products could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
because our customers are concentrated in a few industries  a reduction in sales to any one of these industries could cause a significant decline in our revenues 
an economic slowdown in manufacturing will affect our growth and profitability 
approximately of our sales are to manufacturers in the automotive  aerospace and heavy equipment industries 
we are dependent upon the continued growth  viability and financial stability of our customers in these industries  which are highly cyclical and dependent upon the general health of the economy and consumer spending 
the cyclical nature of these industries may exert significant influence on our revenues and results of operations 
in addition  the volume of orders from our customers and the prices of our products may be adversely impacted by decreases in capital spending by a significant portion of our customers during recessionary periods 
in addition  we generate significant accounts receivable in connection with providing products and services to our customers 
if one or more of our significant customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the products provided by us  our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
the potential size and growth of the cam market could be less than we anticipate 
because the cam market is emerging  the potential size and growth of the cam market is uncertain and difficult to quantify 
if the cam market does not continue to expand or does not expand at least as quickly as we anticipate  we will not be able to continue our sales growth  which will affect our profitability 
our inability to protect our patents and proprietary rights in the united states and foreign countries could adversely affect our revenues 
our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary right protection for our processes and products in the united states and other countries 
we also rely upon trade secrets  technical know how and continuing inventions to maintain our competitive position 
we seek to protect our technology and trade secrets  in part  by confidentiality agreements with our employees and contractors 
our employees may breach these agreements or our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by inventors 
if we are unable to obtain or maintain protection of our patents  trade secrets and other proprietary rights  we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary rights 
our patent protection involves complex legal and technical questions 
our patents may be challenged  narrowed  invalidated or circumvented 
we may be able to protect our proprietary rights from infringement by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary processes and products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies 
litigation or other proceedings to defend or enforce our intellectual property rights could require us to spend significant time and money and could otherwise adversely affect our business 
claims from others that we infringe their intellectual property rights may adversely affect our operations 
from time to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights 
the number of these claims may grow 
responding to these claims may require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on unfavorable terms  require us to stop selling or to redesign affected products or require us to pay damages 
any litigation or interference proceedings  regardless of their outcome  may be costly and may require significant time and attention of our management and technical personnel 
our operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our annual and quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and likely will vary significantly in the future as a result of the size and timing of customer orders  many of which are received towards the end of the quarter  sales promotions and sales of demonstration equipment  geographic expansion in the asia pacific region and other regions  training and ramp up time for new sales people  investments in technologies and new products  our effective tax rate  the amount of time that it takes to fulfill orders and ship our products  the length of our sales cycle to new customers and the time and expense incurred in further penetrating our existing customer base  increases in operating expenses for product development and new product marketing  costs associated with new product introductions  such as assembly line start up costs and low introductory period production volumes  the timing and market acceptance of new products and product enhancements  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products and product enhancements  our success in expanding our sales and marketing programs  start up costs and ramp up time associated with opening new sales offices outside of the united states  fluctuations in revenue without proportionate adjustments in fixed costs  the efficiencies achieved in managing inventories and fixed assets  and adverse changes in the manufacturing industry and general economic conditions 
any one or a combination of these factors could adversely affect our annual and quarterly operating results in the future 
the cam market is an emerging market and our growth depends on the ability of our products to attain broad market acceptance 
the cam market is in an early stage of adoption 
the market for traditional fixed base cmms  check fixtures  and other handheld measurement tools is mature 
part of our strategy is to continue to displace these traditional measurement devices 
displacing traditional measurement devices and achieving broad market acceptance of our products requires significant effort to convince manufacturers to reevaluate their historical measurement procedures and methodologies 
we market four closely interdependent products faro arm  scan arm  faro laser tracker and faro gage and related software for use in measurement and inspection applications 
substantially all our revenues are currently derived from sales of these products and software and we plan to continue our business strategy of focusing on the portable software driven  d measurement and inspection market 
consequently  our financial performance will depend in large part on portable  computer based measurement and inspection products achieving broad market acceptance 
if our products cannot attain broad market acceptance  we will not grow as anticipated and may be required to make increased expenditures on research and development for new applications or new products 
we compete with manufacturers of portable measurement systems and traditional measurement devices  many of which have more resources than us and may develop products or technologies that will directly compete with us 
our portable measurement systems compete in the broad market for measurement devices for manufacturing and industrial applications  which  in addition to portable articulated arms and laser tracker products  consists of fixed base cmms  check fixtures  and handheld measurement tools 
the broad market for measurement devices is highly competitive 
in the faro gage product line  manufacturers of handheld measurement tools and fixed base cmms include a significant number of well established companies that are substantially larger and possess substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we possess 
in the faro arm product line  we compete with hexagon metrology  who is significantly larger than us 
in the faro laser tracker product line  we compete primarily with leica geosystems  who is significantly larger than us 
we will be required to make continued investments in technology and product development to maintain our technological advantage over our competition 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to make additional investments in technology and product development or that our product development efforts will allow us to successfully compete as the industry evolves 
our competitors may develop products or technologies that directly compete with us 
for example  fixed base cmm manufacturers are introducing cad based inspection software in response to the trend toward cad based factory floor metrology 
in addition  some fixed base cmm manufacturers are miniaturizing and increasing the mobility of their conventional cmms 
these companies may continue to alter their products and devote resources to the development and marketing of additional products that compete with ours 
we derive a substantial part of our revenues from our international operations  which are subject to greater volatility and often require more management time and expense to achieve profitability than our domestic operations 
since  we have derived approximately of our sales from international operations 
we opened a manufacturing facility in schaffhausen  switzerland in and have regional sales offices in germany  france  spain  italy  japan  china  india  south korea and the united kingdom 
should trade relations between the united states and china deteriorate  our ability to transfer products between china and other regions of the world  including the united states  asia and europe could be significantly impaired and our results of operations would suffer 
in our experience  entry into new international markets requires considerable management time as well as start up expenses for market development  hiring and establishing office facilities before any significant revenues are generated 
as a result  initial operations in a new market may operate at low margins or may be unprofitable 
our international operations may be subject to a number of risks including difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  political and economic instability  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws  longer customer payment cycles and difficulty collecting accounts receivable  export duties  import controls and trade barriers  governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the united states  burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and labor practices  and fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which could affect local payroll utility and other expenses 
several of the countries where we operate have emerging or developing economies  which may be subject to greater currency volatility  negative growth  high inflation  limited availability of foreign exchange and other risks 
these factors may harm our results of operations and any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our international operations may not be effective 
in addition  during and several asian countries  including japan  experienced severe currency fluctuation and economic deflation 
if such situations reoccur or occur in other regions where we operate  it may negatively impact our sales and our ability to collect payments from customers in these regions 
we rely to a large extent on the experience and management ability of our senior executive officers 
our success will depend  in part  on the services of our founders  simon raab  our chief executive officer  and gregory fraser  our executive vice president  secretary and treasurer  and jay freeland  our president and chief operating officer  who was hired in november  and our chief financial officer  barbara smith  who was hired in february the loss or interruption of the continued full time services of these executives could have a material adverse effect on us 
we do not have employment agreements with these executives 
we may not be able to identify  consummate or achieve expected benefits from acquisitions 
we have completed two significant acquisitions since our initial public offering in we intend to pursue access to additional technologies  complementary product lines and sales channels through selective acquisitions and strategic investments 
we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions  obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future 
in the past we have used our stock as consideration for acquisitions 
our common stock may not remain at a price at which it can be used as consideration for acquisitions without diluting our existing shareholders  and potential acquisition candidates may not view our stock attractively 
realization of the benefits of acquisitions often requires integration of some or all of the acquired companies sales and marketing  distribution  manufacturing  engineering  finance and administrative organizations 
the integration of acquisitions demands substantial attention from senior management and the management of the acquired companies 
any acquisition may be subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties including the inability to assimilate effectively the operations  products  technologies and personnel of the acquired companies some of which may be located in diverse geographic regions  the inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  the need or obligation to divest portions of the acquired companies  and the potential impairment of relationships with customers 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate successfully any acquisitions  that any acquired companies will operate profitably or that we will realize the expected benefits from any acquisition 
we may face difficulties managing growth 
our growth has placed significant demands on our management and operations and financial resources 
if our business continues to grow rapidly in the future  we expect it to result in increased responsibility for existing and new management personnel  and incremental strain on our operations and financial and management systems 
our success under such conditions will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our executive officers and other members of senior management to operate effectively both independently and as a group 
if we are not able to manage future growth  our business  financial condition and operating results may be harmed 
our dependence on suppliers for materials could impair our ability to manufacture our products 
outside vendors provide key components used by us in the manufacture of our products 
although we believe that alternative sources for these components are available  any supply interruption in a limited source component would harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply is identified 
in addition  an uncorrected defect or supplier s variation in a component  either known or unknown to us  or incompatible with our manufacturing processes  could harm our ability to manufacture our products 
we may not be able to find a sufficient alternative supplier in a reasonable period  or on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if we fail to obtain a supplier for the manufacture of components of our potential products  we may experience delays or interruptions in our operations  which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we may experience volatility in our stock price 
the price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  highly volatile in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including developments in the industries in which we operate  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly or annual operating results  speculation in the press or investment community  and announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors 
our common stock s market price may also be affected by our inability to meet analyst and investor expectations and failure to achieve projected financial results  including those set forth in this prospectus 
any failure to meet such expectations or projected financial results  even if minor  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
volatility in our stock price may result in your inability to sell your shares at or above the price at which you purchased them 
in addition  stock markets have generally experienced a high level of price and volume volatility  and the market prices of equity securities of many companies have experienced wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our common stock s market price 
in the past  securities class action lawsuits frequently have been instituted against such companies following periods of volatility in the market price of such companies securities 
if any such litigation is instigated against us  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our executive officers and directors control a significant percentage of our common stock and these shareholders may take actions that are adverse to your interests 
our two co founders  simon raab and gregory fraser  beneficially own approximately of our common stock 
as a result  these shareholders  acting together  can significantly influence all matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election and removal of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers  consolidations and sales of assets 
they also could dictate the management of our business and affairs 
this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control or impeding a merger or consolidation  takeover or other business combination  which could cause the market price of our common stock to fall or prevent you from receiving a premium in such a transaction 
anti takeover provisions in our articles of incorporation  our bylaws and provisions of florida law could delay or prevent a change of control that you may favor 
our articles of incorporation  our bylaws and provisions of florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to you 
these provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our shares 
because of these provisions  you might not be able to receive a premium on your investment 
these provisions include a limitation on shareholders ability to call a special meeting of our shareholders  advance notice requirements to nominate directors for election to our board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings  our classified board of directors  which means that approximately one third of our directors are elected each year  and the authority of the board of directors to issue  without shareholder approval  preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine 
the provisions described above could delay or make more difficult transactions involving a change in control of us  or our management 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange exposure the company conducts a significant portion of its business outside the united states 
at present  a slight majority of the company s revenues are invoiced  and a significant portion of its operating expenses paid  in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition  and could specifically result in foreign exchange gains and losses 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on the results of the company s operations cannot be accurately predicted 
to the extent that the percentage of the company s non us dollar revenues derived from international sales increases in the future  the company s exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will increase further 
inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its results of operations in recent years and does not expect inflation to have a material impact on its operations in
