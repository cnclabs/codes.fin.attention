critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
we discuss below the critical accounting estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our critical accounting policies  see the discussion in the section titled recent accounting pronouncements below and note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry 
revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and are subject to change 
our revenue recognition policy is one of our critical accounting policies because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and is based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates 
in applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions  if any  must be deferred 
in order to determine current and deferred revenue  we make judgments and estimates with regard to future deliverable products and services and the appropriate pricing for those products and services 
our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services could differ from actual events  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
we have to estimate provisions for returns which are recorded against our revenues 
in determining our estimate for returns  and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue  we rely upon historical data  the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel  the rate at which our product sells through to the end user  product plans and other factors 
our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs 
more or less product may be returned from what was estimated 
the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated 
our estimate of the rate of sell through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs 
there could be a delay in the release of our products 
these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
management must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb recently enacted statement of financial accounting standards revised sfas r  share based payment which replaces statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of income 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june  we are required to adopt sfas r in the fourth quarter of fiscal the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net income and net income per share amounts  for fiscal through fiscal  as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of income and net income per share 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creations act of ajca

results of operations overview of during the fiscal  we continued to focus on delivering comprehensive technology platforms for enterprises and creative professionals to drive revenue and earnings growth 
our latest acrobat desktop products  released during fiscal  continued to perform well which indicates we are making progress against our intelligent documents segment strategy to increase the adoption of acrobat 
our intelligent documents initiatives continue to deliver a comprehensive server based platform to help governments and enterprises improve their business processes 
our intelligent documents server revenue has achieved both strong sequential and year over year revenue growth 
additionally  we believe our strategy of providing creative professionals a complete design platform is resonating with our customers 
the success we achieved in fiscal in our creative professional business segment continued in fiscal due to strong licensing of our adobe creative suites and cs products 
we continue to focus on delivering innovative products and solutions for our customers 
however  our success could be limited by several factors  including the timely release of new products  continued market acceptance of our products  the introduction of new products by existing or new competitors and unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations 
for a further discussion of these and other risk factors  see the section titled factors that may affect future performance 
revenue fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal product    percentage of total revenues services and support percentage of total revenues total revenues    we have four reportable segments digital imaging and video  creative professional  intelligent documents  and oem postscript and other 
the digital imaging and video segment provides users with software for creating  editing  enhancing and sharing digital images and photographs  digital video  audio and animations 
the creative professional segment provides software for professional page layout  professional web page layout  graphic and illustration creation  technical document publishing and business publishing 
additionally  this segment provides photoshop and acrobat professional as part of its adobe creative suite products 
the intelligent documents segment provides electronic document distribution software that allows users to create  enhance  annotate and securely send adobe pdf files that can be shared  viewed  navigated and printed exactly as intended on a broad range of hardware and software platforms 
in addition  this segment provides server based solutions for enterprises  in the areas of document generation  document process management  document collaboration  and document control and security 
the oem postscript and other segment includes printing technology used to create and print simple or visually rich documents with precision 
our services and support revenue is composed of professional services such as consulting services and training and maintenance and support  primarily related to the licensing of our intelligent documents server solution products 
our support revenue also includes technical support and developer support to partners and developer organizations related to our desktop products 
our professional services revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method and is measured monthly based on input measures  such as hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete  with consideration given to output measures  such as contract milestones  when applicable 
our maintenance and support offerings  which entitle customers to receive product upgrades and enhancements or technical support  depending on the offering  is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal digital imaging and video percentage of total revenues creative professional percentage of total revenues intelligent documents percentage of total revenues oem postscript and other percentage of total revenues total revenues    fiscal revenue compared to fiscal revenue revenue from our digital imaging and video segment increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to increases in revenues from both our digital video and digital imaging software products 
revenue from our digital video software products increased during fiscal which was attributable to new releases during fiscal revenue from our digital imaging software products increased during fiscal due to continued success with adobe photoshop cs which was released at the end of fiscal as well as the release of photoshop elements in fiscal revenue from our creative professional segment increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the continued strength of our adobe creative suite products which were initially released in the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in revenues from our adobe creative suite products were partially offset by decreases in revenues in our business and technical page layout software products due to product lifecycle timing 
revenue from our intelligent documents segment increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to a increase in revenues from our acrobat desktop products as a result of continued adoption of acrobat desktop products launched in fiscal additionally  revenue from our intelligent documents server based products increased due to increased licensing and server support revenue 
revenue from our oem postscript and other segment decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to a decline in pricing resulting from competition from clone postscript technologies and lower prices of output devices 
revenue from this segment has declined over the last few years and we expect this trend to continue  but if the decline significantly exceeds our expectations  it may harm our future results 
fiscal revenue compared to fiscal revenue revenue from our digital imaging and video segment decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to a decrease in revenues from our digital imaging software products 
overall  we experienced a decrease in revenues from our digital imaging software products  which was mainly attributable to product lifecycle timing 
with the introduction of adobe creative suite  which includes photoshop  we experienced a shift in revenue from photoshop to the adobe creative suite which is reported in the creative professional segment 
the decrease in revenues from our digital imaging software products was partially offset by an increase in revenues from our digital video software products 
the increase in revenues from our digital video software products was due primarily to new releases of adobe video collection 
revenue from our creative professional segment increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to a increase in revenues from the release of new products during fiscal  including the introduction of adobe creative suite  as well as our professional page layout products 
this increase was partially offset by decreases in revenues from our other products in the creative professional segment 
revenues from our business publishing products decreased due to the planned migration of customers to our professional page layout products 
finally  revenues from our illustration  type and technical publishing  and web publishing products decreased by  which was primarily attributable to product lifecycle timing 
revenue from our intelligent documents segment increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to new releases of our acrobat desktop products during the second quarter of fiscal  as well as increased sales and marketing focus  enhanced corporate and government licensing programs  and product price increases 
overall we experienced a increase in revenues from our acrobat desktop products  which was driven by continued adoption of acrobat desktop products in government  financial services  manufacturing  and the architecture  engineering and construction markets among others 
additionally  revenues from our intelligent documents segment increased due to a increase in revenues from licensing of our intelligent documents server solution products and the professional services and support revenue associated with these products 
the increase in revenue generated from the licensing of our intelligent documents server solution products and associated professional services and support was primarily attributable to the acquisition of accelio during the second quarter of fiscal revenue from our oem postscript and other segment remained relatively stable during fiscal as compared to fiscal this was due to an increase in royalty revenues from our larger oem customers during the first half of fiscal this increase was offset by a decline in revenues in the second half of the year due to weakness in the print business and smaller oem customers moving to clone postscript technologies 
geographic information fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal americas percentage of total revenues emea percentage of total revenues asia percentage of total revenues total revenues    the increase in revenues  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  in each of our geographic segments was primarily due to the strength of our creative professional products 
the increase in revenues  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  in each of our geographic segments was primarily due to the strength of our intelligent documents desktop products 
additionally  revenues in emea and asia increased approximately million and million  respectively  during fiscal over fiscal due to the strength of the euro and the yen 
in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  revenues in emea and asia increased approximately million and million  respectively  due to the strength of the euro and the yen 
platform information fiscal fiscal fiscal windows macintosh we expect a growth trend towards the windows platform over the long term due to our targeting of business users with our intelligent documents desktop products  where the majority of users run the windows operating system 
inventory information at the end of fiscal our channel inventory position was within our global inventory policy which allows up to an estimated weeks of anticipated product supply at our distributors 
with regard to our product backlog  our experience is that the actual amount of backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects 
for example  prior to the finalization and release of new products  we may have significant levels of orders for new product releases 
at the end of fiscal  we had significant levels of such backlog due to the announced  but yet to be completed and released new version of acrobat and related products 
our backlog of unfulfilled orders at the end of fiscal  other than those associated with new product releases  those pending credit review and those due to the application of our global channel inventory policy  was approximately of reported fourth quarter fiscal revenue 
the comparable backlog at the end of our third quarter fiscal was approximately of third quarter fiscal revenue 
cost of revenues fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal product percentage of total revenues services and support percentage of total revenues total cost of revenues product cost of product revenue includes product packaging  third party royalties  excess and obsolete inventory  amortization related to localization costs and acquired technologies  and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products 
in fiscal  cost of product revenue also included hosted server costs associated with the adobe designteam 
cost of product revenue increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to licensing costs as a result of litigation settlements that occurred in fiscal and an increase in localization costs related to our product launches 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in overall material costs 
cost of product revenue decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to product mix 
during fiscal  we received higher licensing revenue versus shrink wrapped product revenue  compared to fiscal  which resulted in lower material costs 
additionally  cost of product revenue for fiscal included the amortization and impairment costs associated with the adobe designteam  which was discontinued during the third quarter of fiscal services and support cost of services and support revenue is composed primarily of employee related costs and related costs incurred to provide consulting services  training and product support 
cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to costs associated with our expert support program that was initiated during the second quarter of fiscal additionally  cost of services and support revenue increased due to compensation and related benefits as a result of higher headcount and incentive compensation related to increases in services and support activities in fiscal cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the acquisition of accelio during the second quarter of fiscal operating expenses research and development fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal expenses percentage of total revenues research and development expenses consist principally of compensation and benefit expenses for software developers  contracted development efforts  related facilities costs  and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development 
research and development expenses increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth and higher incentive compensation 
the remaining increase in research and development expenses for fiscal was due to various individually insignificant items 
research and development expenses increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth and higher incentive compensation and increased due to an accrual for major product releases 
the remaining increase in research and development expenses during fiscal was due to various individually insignificant items 
we believe that investments in research and development  including the recruiting and hiring of software developers  are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products 
we will continue to focus on long term opportunities available in our end markets and make significant investments in the development of our desktop application and server based software products

the remaining increase in sales and marketing expenses during fiscal was due to various individually insignificant items 
sales and marketing expenses increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth and higher incentive compensation 
the remaining increase in sales and marketing expenses during fiscal was due to various individually insignificant items 
general and administrative fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal expenses percentage of total revenues general and administrative expenses consist of compensation and benefit expenses  travel expenses  and related facilities costs for our finance  facilities  human resources  legal  information services and executive personnel

these increases were slightly offset by various individually insignificant items 
restructuring and other charges fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal expenses percentage of total revenues percentage is not meaningful 
we did not incur any restructuring and other charges in fiscal during fiscal  we revised our estimates of certain costs associated with our restructuring program that was implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  we revised the accrual related to severance and other charges and facilities 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we incurred a restructuring charge of million  which included severance and related charges and the closure of a facility 
the related restructuring program eliminated engineering  sales and marketing  and general and administrative positions worldwide in order to realign our resources for our future business plans 
this restructuring plan was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan to eliminate redundant sales and marketing positions  held by adobe employees worldwide  as a result of the acquisition of accelio 
the total restructuring charges  of million  included severance and related charges associated with the reduction in force and the cost of vacating a leased facility 
this restructuring plan was completed during the second quarter of fiscal additionally  during the second quarter of fiscal  we revised our estimates of certain costs associated with our restructuring program that was implemented in fiscal as a result  we revised the accrual by million related to relocation  severance and other charges 
acquired in process research and development fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal expenses percentage of total revenues percentage is not meaningful 
we did not allocate any expenses to acquired in process research and development in fiscal and in april  we acquired of the outstanding common stock of accelio  a provider of web enabled solutions that helped customers manage business processes driven by electronic forms 
based on a valuation analysis  million was allocated to in process research and development  which was expensed as of the date of the acquisition due to the state of the development of certain products and the uncertainty of the technology 
in december  we acquired fotiva  a development stage software company that created solutions to help consumers manage  store  enrich  and share digital photographs and other related personal media 
substantially all of fotiva s assets were intellectual property 
in connection with the acquisition  substantially all of the purchase price of million cash was allocated to in process research and development and expensed at the time of acquisition due to the in process state of the technology 
amortization and impairment of goodwill and purchased and other intangibles fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal expenses percentage of total revenues percentage is not meaningful 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized after fiscal instead  the goodwill associated with past and any future acquisitions is reviewed annually for impairment 
for further information  see notes and in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we assessed our goodwill for impairment 
this assessment did not result in an impairment of goodwill 
amortization and impairment of goodwill and purchased and other intangibles in fiscal included a goodwill impairment charge for the remaining book value of the glassbook acquisition 
non operating income loss fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal investment gain loss percentage of total revenues interest and other income percentage of total revenues total non operating income loss percentage is not meaningful 
investment gain loss investment gain loss consists of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments  other than temporary declines in the value of marketable and non marketable equity securities  and gains and losses of adobe ventures 
during fiscal  net investment gain primarily comprised gains from the sales of our short term investments of million 
during fiscal  net investment losses included net losses related to our investments in adobe ventures and our cost method investments totaling million 
this loss of million was partially offset by gains of million from the sale of our short term investments 
during fiscal  investment losses also included write downs due to other than temporary declines in value of million related to our short term investments 
during fiscal  investment losses consisted of net investment losses related to investments in adobe ventures and our cost method investments totaling million 
we also recorded million in losses related to other than temporary write downs of our short term investments 
these losses were partially offset by gains totaling million from the sale of our short term investments 
we are uncertain of future investment gains or losses as they are primarily dependent upon market conditions and the operations of the underlying investee companies 
interest and other income the largest component of interest and other income is interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term fixed income investments  but also includes gains and losses on the sale of fixed income investments  foreign exchange transaction gains and losses  and interest expense 
interest and other income increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to higher levels of cash during fiscal in fiscal  interest decreased by million due to the lower interest rate environment in fiscal as compared to fiscal we also recognized million less in realized gains on our fixed income portfolio 
those decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in other miscellaneous income 
income tax provision fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal provision percentage of total revenues effective tax rate our effective tax rate decreased in fiscal from fiscal and in fiscal from fiscal due to higher international profits which are taxed at a lower statutory rate 
in fiscal  the effective tax rate included a non deductible goodwill impairment charge of approximately 
on october   ajca was signed into law 
the ajca introduced a limited time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings 
this deduction would result in an approximate federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings 
to qualify for the deduction  the earnings must be reinvested in the united states pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by a company s chief executive officer and approved by the company s board of directors 
additionally  certain other criteria  as outlined in the ajca  must also be met 
we may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in fiscal we have started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision 
however  we do not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until after congress or the treasury department provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision 
in january  the treasury department began to issue the first of a series of clarifying guidance documents related to this provision 
we expect to complete our evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision within the first two fiscal quarters of the range of possible amounts that we are considering for repatriation under this provision is between zero and million 
while we estimate that the related potential range of additional income tax is between zero and million  this estimation is subject to change following technical correction legislation that we believe is forthcoming from congress 
the amount of additional income tax would be reduced by the part of the eligible dividend that is attributable to foreign earnings on which a deferred tax liability had been previously accrued 
factors that may affect future performance as previously discussed  our actual results could differ materially from our forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below 
these and many other factors described in this report could adversely affect our operations  performance and financial condition 
adverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our operating results 
if the economy worsens in any geographic areas where we do business  it would likely cause our future results to vary materially from our targets 
a slower economy also may adversely affect our ability to grow 
political instability in any of the major countries in which we do business also may adversely affect our business 
delays in development or shipment of new products or major new versions of existing products could cause a decline in our revenue 
any delays or failures in developing and marketing our products  including upgrades of current products  may have a harmful impact on our results of operations 
our inability to extend our core technologies into new applications and new platforms and to anticipate or respond to technological changes could affect continued market acceptance of our products and our ability to develop new products 
a portion of our future revenue will come from new applications 
delays in product or upgrade introductions could cause a decline in our revenue  earnings or stock price 
we cannot determine the ultimate effect these delays or the introduction of new products or upgrades will have on our revenue or results of operations 
introduction of new products by existing and new competitors  particularly microsoft  could harm our competitive position and results of operations 
the end markets for our software products are intensely and increasingly competitive  and are significantly affected by product introductions and market activities of industry competitors 
microsoft has an electronic form tool called infopath included as part of its latest professional office product that competes with certain aspects of our intelligent documents product line 
given microsoft s market dominance  infopath  or any new competitive microsoft product or technology that is bundled as part of its office product or operating system  could harm our overall intelligent documents market opportunity 
in addition  microsoft is developing the next generation of its windows operating system  codenamed longhorn 
it is anticipated that microsoft will add new electronic document capabilities to longhorn  providing additional competition to our intelligent documents products and solutions 
also  some enterprise vendors provide intelligent document capabilities that could directly or indirectly compete with our intelligent documents products 
additionally  content creation management tools that use other formats for electronic document distribution provide alternate solutions to customers  and indirectly compete with adobe s intelligent documents products and the use of adobe pdf 
we also are seeing an increase in competition from clone pdf products marketed by other companies 
other competitors  including microsoft  apple and google  may increase their presence in the digital imaging markets 
we also face competition from certain open source products 
additionally  many digital camera manufacturers are bundling their own or our competitors digital imaging and video software products with their digital camera products 
if these competing products achieve widespread acceptance  our operating results could suffer 
in addition  consolidation has occurred among some of the competitors in our markets 
any further consolidations among our competitors may result in stronger competitors and may therefore harm our results of operations 
if we fail to successfully manage transitions to new business models or markets our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
we are devoting significant resources to the development of technologies and service offerings to address demands in the marketplace for document generation  document process management  document collaboration  and document control and security 
as a result  we are transitioning to new business models and seeking to broaden our customer base in the enterprise and government markets  requiring a considerable investment of technical  financial and sales resources  and a scaleable organization 
many of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their larger presence  larger developer network  deeper experience in the enterprise and government markets  and greater sales and marketing resources 
it is our intent to form strategic alliances with leading enterprise and government solutions and service providers to provide additional resources to further enable penetration of the enterprise and government markets 
if we are unable to successfully enter into strategic alliances  or if they are not as productive as we anticipate  our market penetration may not proceed as rapidly as we anticipate and our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
our limited operating history with adobe creative suite products makes it difficult to predict the revenue effect of the adobe creative suite product cycle and the individual products integrated within these products 
if we fail to anticipate and develop new products in response to changes in demand for application software  computers and printers our business could be harmed 
we offer our application based products primarily on windows and macintosh platforms and on some unix platforms 
we generally offer our server based products  but not desktop application products  on the linux platform as well as the windows and unix platforms 
to the extent that there is a slowdown of customer purchases of personal computers on either the windows or macintosh platform or in general  or to the extent that significant demand arises for our products or competitive products on the linux desktop platform before we choose and are able to offer our products on this platform  our business could be harmed 
we may incur substantial costs enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending against third party claims as a result of litigation or other proceedings 
in connection with the enforcement of our own intellectual property rights or in connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third party rights  including but not limited to patent rights  we have been  are currently and may in the future be subject to claims  negotiations or complex  protracted litigation 
intellectual property disputes and litigation are typically very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel 
although we have successfully defended or resolved past litigation and disputes  we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes 
adverse decisions in such litigation or disputes could have negative results  including subjecting us to significant liabilities  requiring us to seek licenses from others  preventing us from manufacturing or licensing certain of our products  or causing severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete  any one of which could seriously harm our business 
additionally  although we actively pursue software pirates as part of our enforcement of our intellectual property rights  we do lose revenue due to illegal use of our software 
if piracy activities increase  it may further harm our business 
we rely on distributors to sell our products and any adverse change in our relationship with our distributors could result in a loss of revenue and harm our business 
we distribute our application products primarily through distributors  resellers  retailers and increasingly systems integrators  isvs and vars collectively referred to as distributors 
a significant amount of our revenue for application products is from two distributors  ingram micro  inc and tech data corporation 
in addition  our channel program focuses our efforts on larger distributors  which has resulted in our dependence on a relatively small number of distributors licensing a large amount of our products 
our distributors also sell our competitors products  and if they favor our competitors products for any reason  they may fail to market our products as effectively or to devote resources necessary to provide effective sales  which would cause our results to suffer 
in addition  the financial health of these distributors and our continuing relationships with them are important to our success 
some of these distributors may be unable to withstand adverse changes in business conditions 
our business could be seriously harmed if the financial condition of some of these distributors substantially weakens 
if our internal computer network and applications suffer disruptions or fail to operate as designed our operations will be disrupted and our business may be harmed 
we rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications  internal technology systems and our website for our development  marketing  operational  support and sales activities 
the hardware and software systems related to such activities are subject to damage from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures and other similar events 
they are also subject to acts such as computer viruses  physical or electronic vandalism or other similar disruptions also could cause system interruptions  delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers orders 
we have developed disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events  as they could impact our sales and damage our reputation and the reputation of our products 
any event that causes failures or interruption in our hardware or software systems could result in disruption in our business operations  loss of revenues or damage to our reputation 
we rely on turnkey assemblers and any adverse change in our relationship with our turnkey assemblers could result in a loss of revenue and harm our business 
we currently rely on six turnkey assemblers of our products  with at least two turnkeys located in each major region we serve 
if any significant turnkey assembler terminates its relationship with us  or if our supply from any significant turnkey assembler is interrupted or terminated for any other reason  we may not have enough time or be able to replace the supply of products replicated by that turnkey assembler to avoid serious harm to our business 
our future operating results are difficult to predict and are likely to fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter and as a result the market price of our common stock may be volatile and our stock price could decline 
as a result of a variety of factors discussed herein  our quarterly revenues and operating results for a particular period are difficult to predict 
our revenues may grow at a slower rate than experienced in previous periods and  in particular periods  may decline 
additionally  we periodically provide operating model targets for revenue  gross margin  operating expenses  operating margin  other income  tax rate  share count and earnings per share 
these targets reflect a number of assumptions  including assumptions about product pricing and demand  economic and seasonal trends  manufacturing costs and volumes  the mix of shrink wrap and licensing revenue  full and upgrade products  distribution channels and geographic markets 
if one or more of these assumptions prove incorrect  our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected 
due to the factors noted above  our future earnings and stock price may be subject to volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings or any delay in the release of any product or upgrade compared to analysts or investors expectations has caused and could cause in the future an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common stock 
additionally  we may not learn of such shortfalls or delays until late in the fiscal quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and greater decline in the trading price of our common stock 
finally  we participate in a highly dynamic industry 
in addition to factors specific to us  changes in analysts earnings estimates for us or our industry  and factors affecting the corporate environment  our industry  or the securities markets in general  will often result in volatility of our common stock price 
we are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm our business 
we generate over of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of the americas 
sales to these customers subject us to a number of risks  including i foreign currency fluctuations  ii changes in government preferences for software procurement  iii international economic and political conditions  iv unexpected changes in  or impositions of  international legislative or regulatory requirements  v inadequate local infrastructure  vi delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs  quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions  vii transportation delays  viii the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and other factors beyond our control  including terrorism  war  natural disasters and diseases 
if sales to any of our customers outside of the americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors  our revenue may be negatively impacted 
we may incur losses associated with currency fluctuations and may not be able to effectively hedge our exposure 
our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging  based on our judgment of the appropriate trade offs among risk  opportunity and expense 
we have established a hedging program to partially hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  primarily the japanese yen and the euro 
we regularly review our hedging program and will make adjustments based on our judgment 
our hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
changes in  or interpretations of  accounting rules and regulations  such as expensing of stock options  could result in unfavorable accounting charges 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the securities and exchange commission the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions 
our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows software revenue recognition accounting for share based payments accounting for income taxes accounting for business combinations and related goodwill in particular  the fasb recently enacted sfas r which will have a significant adverse effect on our reported financial results and may impact the way in which we conduct our business 
changes in  or interpretations of  tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective tax rates 
unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations 
our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws  by unanticipated decreases in the amount of revenue or earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates  or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other domestic and foreign tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
any adverse outcome from these continuous examinations may have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 
we may suffer losses from our equity investments which could harm our business 
we hold equity investments in public companies that have experienced significant declines in market value 
we also have investments and may continue to make future investments in privately held companies  many of which are considered in the start up or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky  as the market for the technologies or products these companies have under development is typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
our investment activities can impact our net income 
future price fluctuations in these securities and any significant long term declines in value of any of our investments could reduce our net income in future periods 
we are uncertain about future investment gains and losses  as they are primarily dependent upon the operations of the underlying investee companies 
if we are unable to recruit and retain skilled personnel our business may be harmed 
much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel 
experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense  especially in the silicon valley  where the majority of our employees are located 
we have relied on our ability to grant equity compensation as one mechanism for recruiting and retaining such highly skilled personnel 
recently enacted accounting regulations requiring the expensing of equity compensation may impair our ability to provide these incentives without incurring significant compensation costs 
if we are unable to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel  our business may be harmed 
employee and director stock options option program description our stock option program is a long term retention program that is intended to attract  retain and provide incentives for talented employees  officers and directors  and to align stockholder and employee interests 
we consider our stock option program critical to our operation and productivity  essentially all of our employees participate

in may  a stock option exchange program was initiated that allowed eligible employees to exchange options granted with an option price greater than per share for a lesser number of new options  according to specified exchange ratios 
the program excluded executive officers and members of our board of directors

the primary uses of cash are payroll salaries  bonuses  and benefits  general operating expenses marketing  travel  office rent and cost of product revenue 
another source of cash is proceeds from the exercise of employee options and another use of cash is our stock repurchase program  which is detailed below 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal of million  primarily comprised net income  net of non cash related expenses 
working capital sources of cash were increases in accrued expenses  deferred revenue and a decrease in accounts receivable 
accrued expenses increased primarily due to compensation costs 
deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance and support obligations 
our accounts receivable decreased due to increased levels of cash collections 
our days sales outstanding in trade receivables dso decreased from days at november  to days at december  working capital uses of cash included a decrease in income taxes payable due to tax payments made for both agreed and disputed tax assessments 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal of million primarily comprised net income  net of non cash related expenses  and increases in accrued expenses  income taxes payable and deferred revenue 
accrued expenses increased primarily due to incentive compensation related costs  sales and marketing programs  legal fees and accruals for major product releases 
income taxes payable increased due to an increase in taxable income 
deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance obligations 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in receivables at the end of the year and a decrease in accrued restructuring charges 
the increase in receivables was primarily due to the increase in revenues during the year and the launch of our new creative suites and related cs products at the end of the year 
the decrease in accrued restructuring is primarily due to the payments of severance and facility costs 
during fiscal  cash provided by operating activities of million was primarily due to net income  net of non cash related expenses  an increase in income taxes payable and deferred revenue and a decrease in accounts receivable 
income taxes payable increased due to an increase in taxable income 
deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance obligations 
the decrease in trade receivables was primarily due to our improved collections during fiscal these increases in cash were partially offset by a decrease in accrued restructuring charges and accrued expenses 
accrued restructuring charges decreased primarily due to the payment of severance and related charges 
accrued expenses decreased primarily due to lower incentive compensation related costs 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal of million decreased from net cash used in fiscal of million due primarily to lower net purchases of short term investments as compared to the prior year 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal increased from cash used in fiscal of million  primarily due to net purchases of short term investments 
the increase in purchases of short term investments is attributable to an increase in cash from operations and proceeds from the re issuance of treasury stock during fiscal cash used for financing activities in fiscal of million increased from the cash provided in fiscal of million primarily due to repurchases of stock 
cash used for stock repurchases during fiscal increased from fiscal due to a higher average cost per share  a higher number of shares being repurchased  and remaining prepayments related to stock repurchase agreements 
the cost of the repurchases was partially offset by proceeds received from employees exercising their stock options 
the increase in proceeds received is due to a higher number of options being exercised as well as higher option exercise prices 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal increased from cash used in fiscal of million as more employees exercised their stock options during fiscal due to higher stock prices 
we have paid cash dividends on our common stock each quarter since the second quarter of adobe s board of directors declared a cash dividend on our common stock of per common share for each of the four quarters in fiscal through under the terms of our lease agreements for our san jose headquarters  we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless an event of default occurs 
the declaration of future dividends  whether in cash or in kind  is within the discretion of adobe s board of directors and will depend on business conditions  our results of operations and financial condition  and other factors 
we expect to continue our investing activities  including investments in short term and long term investments and purchases of computer systems for research and development  sales and marketing  product support  and administrative staff 
furthermore  cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase programs and strategically acquire software companies  products or technologies that are complementary to our business 
adobe uses highly regarded investment management firms to manage most of our invested cash 
external investment firms actively managed of adobe s invested balances during the year 
the fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in municipal bonds within the us and in highly rated corporate and sovereign obligations outside of the us the balance of the fixed income portfolio is managed internally and invested primarily in money market funds for working capital purposes 
all investments are made according to guidelines and within compliance of policies approved by the board of directors 
our existing cash  cash equivalents  and investment balances may decline during fiscal in the event of weakening of the economy or changes in our planned cash outlay 
however  based on our current business plan and revenue prospects  we believe that our existing balances together with our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to the risks detailed in the section factors that may affect future performance 
also  while we currently have no committed lines of credit  we believe that our banking relationships and good credit should afford us the opportunity to raise sufficient debt in the bank or public market  if required 
stock repurchase program i on going dilution coverage to facilitate our stock repurchase program designed to minimize dilution from stock issuance primarily from employee stock plans  we repurchase shares in the open market and from time to time enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties 
historically we have sold put warrants and purchased call options 
authorization to repurchase shares to cover on going dilution is not subject to expiration 
however  this repurchase program is limited to covering net dilution from stock issuances and is subject to business conditions and cash flow requirements as determined by our board of directors from time to time 
refer to part ii  item c in this filing for share repurchases during the quarter ended december  during fiscal  we entered into several stock purchase agreements with large financial institutions 
under these agreements  we provided the financial institutions with up front payments totaling million 
the financial institutions agreed to deliver to us  at certain intervals during the contract term  a certain number of our shares based on the volume weighted average price during such intervals less a specified discount 
upon payment  the million was classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet 
these contracts will expire on or before may  on december   we entered into several additional stock purchase agreements with large financial institutions 
under these agreements  we provided the financial institutions with up front payments totaling million 
the financial institutions agreed to deliver to us  at certain intervals during the contract term  a certain number of our shares based on the volume weighted average price during such intervals less a specified discount 
upon payment  the million was classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet 
these contracts will expire on or before june  stock repurchase program ii additional authorization above dilution coverage in march  our board of directors authorized a program to purchase up to an additional million shares of our common stock over a two year period  subject to certain business and cash flow requirements 
the program expired on march  on september   our board of directors authorized a program to purchase up to an additional million shares of our common stock over a three year period  subject to certain business and cash flow requirements

off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations our principal commitments as of december   consist of obligations under operating leases  royalty agreements and various service agreements 
we expect to fulfill all of the following commitments from our working capital 
lease commitments the two lease agreements discussed in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements are subject to standard financial covenants 
as of december  we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants 
we expect to remain within compliance in the next months 
we are comfortable with these limitations and believe they will not impact our credit or cash in the coming year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our lease commitments 
the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december  total less than year years years over years non cancelable operating leases  net of sublease income indemnifications in the normal course of business  we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products 
historically  costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations 
we have commitments to make certain milestone and or retention payments typically entered into in conjunction with various acquisitions  for which we have made accruals in our consolidated financial statements 
in connection with certain acquisitions and purchases of technology assets during fiscal and  we entered into employee retention agreements and are required to make payments upon satisfaction of certain conditions in the agreements 
these costs are being amortized over the retention period to compensation expense 
as of december   we have million remaining to be paid under our retention agreements 
as permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
as part of our limited partnership interests in adobe ventures  we have provided a general indemnification to granite ventures  an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of adobe ventures  for certain events or occurrences while granite ventures is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity provided that granite ventures acts in good faith on behalf of the partnerships 
we are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future claim  but believe the risk of having to make any payments under this general indemnification to be remote 
royalties we have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 
royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue 
royalty expense  which was recorded under our cost of products revenue on our consolidated statements of income  was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and financial instruments all market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non trading purposes 
foreign currency hedging instruments we transact business in foreign countries  in us dollars and in various foreign currencies 
in europe and japan  transactions that are denominated in euro or yen subject us to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to yen denominated product and support revenue in japan and euro denominated product and support revenue in certain european countries 
in fiscal  and  our exposures were billion yen  billion yen and billion yen  respectively 
in fiscal  and  our exposures were million euros  million euros and million euros  respectively 
in addition we also have long term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non usd functional foreign subsidiaries 
for the fiscal years ending december  and november  this long term investment exposure totaled a notional equivalent of million and million  respectively 
at this time we do not hedge these long term investment exposures 
our japanese operating expenses are in yen  and our european operating expenses are primarily in euro  which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to yen and euro denominated product revenue 
in addition  we hedge firmly committed transactions using forward contracts 
these contracts do subject us to risk of accounting gains and losses  however  the gains and losses on these contracts largely offset gains and losses on the assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
we also hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with forward and purchased option contracts 
our revenue hedging policy is designed to reduce the negative impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements 
at december   total outstanding contracts included the notional equivalent of million in foreign currency forward exchange contracts and purchased put option contracts with a notional value of million 
as of december   all contracts were set to expire at various times through june the bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit related losses in the event of their nonperformance 
however  to mitigate that risk we only contract with counterparties with specific minimum rating requirements 
in addition  our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty 
economic hedging hedges of forecasted transactions we use option and forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain operational cash flow exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these foreign exchange contracts  carried at fair value  may have maturities between one and twelve months 
such cash flow exposures result from portions of our forecasted revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the japanese yen and the euro 
we enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted product licensing revenue in the normal course of business  and accordingly  they are not speculative in nature 
we record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  until the forecasted transaction occurs 
when the forecasted transaction occurs  we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue 
in the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur  or it becomes probable that it will not occur  we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to interest and other income loss on the consolidated statement of income at that time 
for the fiscal year ended december   there were no such net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur 
the critical terms of the cash flow hedging instruments are the same as the underlying forecasted transactions 
the changes in fair value of the derivatives are intended to offset changes in the expected cash flows from the forecasted transactions 
we record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in other income loss on the consolidated statement of income 
the time value of purchased derivative instruments is deemed to be ineffective and is recorded in other income loss over the life of the contract 
see also note in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
balance sheet hedging hedging of foreign currency assets and liabilities we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as other income loss 
these derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged 
at december   the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of days or less 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of december  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a and shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
for option contracts  the black scholes equation model was used 
for forward contracts  duration modeling was used where hypothetical changes are made to the spot rates of the currency 
a and increase in the value of the us dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by million and million  respectively 
conversely  a and decrease in the value of the us dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by million and million  respectively 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
as a general rule  we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists 
for example  in many countries revenue from the local currency product licenses substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures  primarily related to operating expenses  on an ongoing basis 
we regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change our hedging program 
see also note in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
equity investments we are exposed to equity price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities 
as of december   our total equity holdings in publicly traded companies were valued at million compared to million at november   a decrease of 
the decrease was due to sales of million and a million decrease in market value adjustment 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that the fair values of these securities could adversely change in the near term 
we have a policy in place to review our equity holdings on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
our policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each company s cash position  earnings revenue outlook  stock price performance over the past six months  liquidity and management ownership 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline in value exists in one of our marketable equity securities  it is our policy to write down these equity investments to the market value and record the related write down in our consolidated statements of income 
the following table represents the potential decrease in fair values of our marketable equity securities that are sensitive to changes in the stock market 
fair value deteriorations of   and were selected based on the probability of their occurrence 
marketable equity securities fixed income investments at december   we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities  including those classified as cash equivalents  of  million compared to  million at november   an increase of 
these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our fixed income investments 
the table below separates the remaining maturities of our fixed income securities into segments to show the approximate exposure to interest rates 
less than one year one year to two years greater than two years total  a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus   or basis points over six month and twelve month time horizons 
the following table represents the potential decrease to the value of our fixed income securities given a negative shift in the yield curve used in our sensitivity analysis 
month horizon month horizon we limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios 
at the present time  the maximum weighted average duration of all portfolios is limited to years 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to any one security issue  limits on exposure to any one issuer and limits on exposure to the type of instrument 
due to limited duration and credit risk criteria established in our guidelines we do not expect the exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk to be material 
privately held investments we have direct investments  as well as indirect investments through adobe ventures  in several privately held companies  many of which can still be considered in the start up or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky  as the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize  and we could lose a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies 
it is our policy to review privately held investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying amount and economic viability of these companies 
this policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each of the companies cash position  financing needs  earnings revenue outlook  operational performance  management ownership changes and competition 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies  and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies
