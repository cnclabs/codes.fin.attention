new accounting standards and disclosures in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin 
consolidation of variable interest entities  and in december issued a revised interpretation fin r 
fin and fin r address the accounting for  and disclosure of investments in variable interest entities 
the company s adoption of fin and fin r during did not have a significant effect on our financial position or results of operations 
on january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
the interpretation addresses consolidation of business enterprises of variable interest 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt statement r on july  statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
as permitted by statement  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were  in  and off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any obligation under any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the company is a party  that has or is reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
contractual and other obligations the following table shows the company s approximate obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations as of december  payment due by period in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total definitions a long term debt obligation means a payment obligation under long term borrowings referenced in fasb statement of financial accounting standards no

d purchase obligations represent an estimate of goods and services to be purchased under outstanding purchase orders not reflected on the company s balance sheet 
in addition  the company sponsors various pension plans that may obligate it to make contributions from time to time 
we expect to make a cash contribution to our pension plans in potential contributions required for and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plan s assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plan s obligations 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
for further information on the critical accounting policies  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where it is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  it records a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what it believes will be collected 
for all other customers  it recognizes reserves for bad debt based on historical experience of bad debts as a percent of revenues for each business unit  adjusted for relative improvements or deterioration in the aging and changes in current economic conditions 
the company evaluates all aged receivables that are over days past its original due date and makes specific reserves on a day and over basis 
the company has a secured interest in most of its wholegoods each customer purchases 
this allows the company  in times of a difficult economy when the customer is unable to pay or has filed for bankruptcy  to repossess the customer s inventory 
this allows the company to maintain a reserve over its cost which usually represents the margin on the original sales price 
the bad debt reserve balance was  at december  and  at december  sales discounts at december  the company had  in reserves for sales discounts compared to  at december  on product shipped to its customers under various promotional programs 
the increase was due primarily to higher discount accruals on the company s alamo  rhino and m w products sold during the pre season program  which ran from august to december of the company reviews the reserve quarterly based on analysis made on program sales outstanding at the time 
the company bases its reserves on historical data relating to discounts taken by the customer under each program 
historically  customers who are qualified to take program discounts will do so to of the time 
inventories obsolete and slow moving the company had a reserve of  at december  and  at december  to cover obsolete and slow moving inventory 
the increase was mainly due to exchange rate fluctuations and to a lesser extent increases in such inventory at the company s holton and gibson city facilities 
the obsolete and slow moving inventory policy states that the reserve is to be calculated as follows inventory with a quantity on hand and no usage over a three year period is deemed obsolete and reserved at percent  and slow moving inventory with little usage requires a percent reserve on items that have a quantity greater than a three year supply 
there may be exceptions to the obsolete and slow moving classifications if approved by an officer of the company based on specific identification of an item or items that are deemed to be either included or excluded from this classification 
the reserve is reviewed and  if necessary  adjustments are made  on a quarterly basis 
the company relies on historical information to support its reserve 
the company does not adjust the reserve balance until the inventory is sold 
warranty the company s warranty policy is generally to provide its customers warranty for up to one year on all wholegood units and days for parts 
warranty reserve  as a percent of sales  is calculated by looking at the current twelve months expenses and prorating that based on twelve months sales with a ninety day to six month lag period 
the company s historical experience is that a customer takes approximately days to six months from the time they receive the unit and put it into operation to file any warranty claim 
a warranty reserve is established for each different marketing group 
reserve balances are evaluated on a quarterly basis and adjustments made when required 
the warranty reserve balance was  at december  and  at december  the decrease was related to lower warranty claims experienced in all three divisions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various financial market risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency risk international sales a portion of the company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in international jurisdictions 
the company primarily manufactures its products in the united states  the uk  france  canada and australia 
the company sells its products primarily within the markets where the products are produced  but certain of the company s sales from its uk operations are denominated in other european currencies 
as a result  the company s financials  specifically the value of its foreign assets  could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the other markets in which the subsidiaries of the company distribute their products 
to mitigate the short term effect of changes in currency exchange rates on the company s functional currency based sales  the company s uk subsidiaries regularly hedge by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge approximately of its future net foreign currency cash receipts over a period of six months 
as of december   the company had  outstanding in forward exchange contracts related to accounts receivable  additionally  there was an exchange contract of  relating to a short term inter company cash transfer from the uk to the us a fluctuation in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value by approximately  however  since these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts should be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged 
at january   the foreign currency hedge agreements were in a favorable position by approximately  in accordance with the provisions of fas  the net of tax on january   was a gain of  in accumulated other comprehensive income with a deferred income tax liability of  at december   the fair value of the hedge agreements was in an unfavorable position  therefore  the derivative financial instruments were recorded as a liability of  accumulated other comprehensive income was adjusted to an accumulated loss of  and the deferred income tax was adjusted to an  tax asset 
as the hedge agreements are deemed to be effective cash flow hedges  there was no income statement impact related to hedge ineffectiveness 
the company has reclassified approximately  of existing gains in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of taxes  during the year ended december  exposure to exchange rates the company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies  predominately in european countries and canada  as a result of the sale of its products in international markets 
foreign currency forward contracts in the uk are used to hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations 
at december   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the company s sales are denominated would result in a decrease in gross profit of  for the year ended december  comparatively  at december   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the company s sales are denominated would have resulted in a decrease in gross profit of approximately  for the year ended december  this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales  changes in exchange rates may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices 
the translation adjustment during was a gain of  on december   the british pound closed at 
relative to the us dollar  and the euro dollar closed at 
relative to the us dollar 
by comparison  on december   the british pound closed at 
relative to the us dollar  and euro dollar closed at 
relative to the us dollar 
no assurance can be given as to future valuation of the british pound or euro or how further movements in those or other currencies could affect future earnings or the financial position of the company 
interest rate risk the company s long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  the company s net income is affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and a two hundred basis point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  the company s interest expense would have changed by approximately  in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management could take actions to mitigate its exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no such actions 
further  this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment
