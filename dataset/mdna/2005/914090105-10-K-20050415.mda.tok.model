item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of the following discussion and analysis is to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating the changes in financial position and results of operations over the past several years 
investors should refer to the consolidated financial statements  the related notes thereto  and statistical information presented elsewhere in this report when reading this section of the report 
the cautionary statements described below are for the purpose of qualifying for the safe harbor provisions of section e of the securities exchange act of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to the allowance for loan losses  servicing rights  other real estate owned and deferred tax assets 
estimates are based on historical experience  information received from third parties and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is determined based on management estimates of the amount required for losses inherent in the portfolio 
these estimates are based on past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
servicing rights servicing rights are evaluated quarterly for possible impairment and are valued based on the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the rights  using independent appraisals and grouping of the underlying loans as to type  term and interest rates 
assumptions as to prepayment speeds and retention rates may change and thereby impact the valuation 
any impairment of a grouping is reported as a valuation allowance 
other real estate owned real estate properties acquired in collection of a loan are recorded at fair value upon acquisition based on appraisals 
any reduction to fair value from the carrying value of the related loan at the time of foreclosure is accounted for as a loan loss 
subsequent reductions in the value of the real estate owned are charged to earnings when probable and estimable 
changes in real estate value in the future may impact the carrying value 
deferred tax assets deferred tax assets are recorded based on estimates of future taxable income and utilization of existing net operating loss carry forwards 
a valuation allowance adjusts deferred tax assets to the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
actual results will impact the estimates of these deferred tax assets 
risk factors our business involves a high degree of risk 
the reader of this report should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this report before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
this could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline  with the loss of all or part of an investment in our common stock 
described below  are the material risks of investing in university bancorp s common stock 
investors should carefully consider these prior to purchasing any shares 
university bank has incurred significant losses and may never achieve sustained profitability university bank sold its profitable upper peninsula operations in late and relocated to ann arbor in early university bank had a net loss from operations each year between and and again in university bank had a profit in and although the bank has been profitable for the past five months ending february   the bank s future profitability is not assured 
management of the bank believes that as the size of loan portfolio and retail deposits continue to increase that the bank should become more profitable  but there is no assurance that expenses will not rise at a faster rate than expected as the bank grows 
there is no assurance that university bank will grow to a size that will enable it to sustain profitability 
university bancorp had an accumulated deficit from operations of  at december  the company s stock is controlled by insiders of the company  which may not provide you with the best possible return on your investment insiders hold a majority of the shares outstanding of the company 
the ranzini group mr 
stephen lange ranzini  dr 
joseph lange ranzini  mr 
paul lange ranzini  orpheus capital  lp and the ranzini family trust dated beneficially owns  or of the issued and outstanding shares at march  these individuals are able to exert a significant measure of control over university bancorp s affairs and policies 
this control could be used  for example  to help prevent an acquisition of university bancorp  precluding shareholders from possibly realizing any possible premium that may be offered for the common stock by a potential acquirer 
your ownership of the company may be further diluted if the bank requires additional capital there can be no assurance that the bank will not need additional capital in the future to support the bank s growth or to counter operating losses 
funds necessary to meet the bank s working capital needs and to finance its expansion might not be available 
if additional equity securities are needed to finance future expansion  such sale could result in significant dilution to the existing shareholders 
the small size of university bank limits its ability to compete with larger financial institutions university bank faces strong competition for deposits  loans and other financial services from numerous michigan and out of state banks  thrifts  credit unions and other financial institutions 
some of the financial institutions with which university bank competes are not subject to the same degree of regulation as university bank 
many of these financial institutions aggressively compete for business in the ann arbor area 
most of the bank s competitors have been in business for many years  have established customer bases  have numerous branches  have substantially higher lending limits  and offer certain services that we do not provide 
the dominant competitors in the ann arbor area are tcf national bank  national city bank  comerica bank  chase bank and key bank 
there can be no assurance that university bank will be able to compete effectively with these competitors unless it can continue to grow its operations 
the year ended december  compared to the years ended december  and summary of results of operations the company s net loss was  in  versus net income of  in and  in basic and diluted loss earnings per share for  and were  and  respectively 
the net loss in includes an  tax expense 
this resulted from a reduction in a deferred tax asset which was not expected to be realized in the future due to the loss in from operations 
net income in included an income tax benefit of  community banking incurred a pretax loss of  during the current year as opposed to a loss of  in in  community banking incurred approximately  in expense related to the resolution of other real estate owned 
additionally  community banking recorded a  impairment charge against the investment in michigan capital fund  lp i 
the charge will eliminate related expense and will therefore increase income by  in and  in community banking is a tax benefit partner in a low to moderate income housing partnership 
the investment provides community banking with tax credits that can be used to offset federal income taxes 
the company s overall tax status does not allow for the tax credits to be carried as an asset 
accordingly  an impairment charge was deemed appropriate 
the expenses for other real estate owned and the impairment more than offset general operational improvement in community banking in as compared to  including a increase in loans and a increase in deposits 
midwest had a loss of  in as compared to income of  in in  midwest benefited from a significant volume of income derived from the high level of mortgage refinancing due to lower rates 
in  this income was substantially less 
income at midwest was negatively impacted in the first half of by investments of about  a month in overhead intended to grow midwest s jumbo and non standard originations through a secondary market conduit established with lehman brothers 
the decrease in mortgage originations offset improvements in other areas including a increase in mortgage loans subserviced  to  loans at december  community banking incurred a pre tax loss of  in as opposed to pre tax income of  in a drop in net interest margin and an increase in the provision for loan losses accounted for most of this variance 
in contrast  pre tax income at midwest increased to  in from  in income at midwest increased with rapidly increasing mortgage originations and a increase in mortgage loans sub serviced  to  loans from  the following table summarizes the pre tax loss income of each profit center of the company for the years ended december    and in thousands community banking midwest loan services corporate office total net interest income net interest income increased to  for year ended december  from  for same period in the yield on average earning assets dropped from in to in this drop occurred as loans repriced in a generally lower medium term interest rate environment throughout most of additionally  the mix of assets changed 
the company increased its single family real estate loans while other loans dropped 
single family real estate loans have a lower yield as compared with commercial and installment loans 
management directed its efforts in increasing this category since real estate loans  specifically single family homes  tend to have lower credit risk 
overall  average interest bearing assets increased to  in from  in the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased from for the period to in average interest bearing liabilities increased to  in from  in the decrease in interest bearing liabilities occurred despite rapidly rising short term interest rates because the bank increased its mix of lower cost deposits relative to higher cost deposits 
the net yield on interest earning assets decreased from in to in due principally to lower yields on loans 
in an effort to improve margins  management is targeting lower cost deposits to fund asset growth 
for  net interest income declined year over year  falling to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the prior year 
during and short term interest rates remained at year lows while long term interest rates showed a decline 
net interest income for declined from the previous period because the average yield on earning assets declined at a higher rate than the average yield on interest bearing deposits 
the yield on average earning assets dropped from in to in the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased from for the period to for the year ended december  the net yield on interest earning assets decreased from to

provision for loan losses the bank charges to operations a provision for loan losses which is intended to create an allowance for future loan losses inherent in the bank s portfolio 
each year s provision reflects management s analysis of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb anticipated losses 
in its evaluation  management considers factors like historical loan loss experience  specifically identified problem loans  composition and growth of the loan portfolio  current and projected economic conditions  and other pertinent factors 
a loan is charged off by management as a loss when deemed uncollectible  although collection efforts continue and future recoveries may occur 
non performing loans are defined as loans which have been placed on non accrual status and loans over days past due as to principal or interest and still in an accrual status 
where serious doubt exists as to the collectibility of a loan  the accrual of interest is discontinued 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding impaired and past due loans 
non performing loans amounted to   and  at december   and  respectively 
at december   there were loans totaling  that were past due over days  but still accruing interest 
payments were made to bring these loans to a current status shortly after year end 
the provision for loan losses in was  compared to  in and  in in  the analysis of the loan loss reserve resulted in a reduction in the provision of  this resulted from lower chargeoffs  payoffs of previously classified problem loans and an improvement in the quality of the loans in the portfolio 
the bank determined the required reserve was less than in previous years 
loans charged off  net of recoveries  were   and  in  and  respectively 
the allowance for possible loan losses totaled   and  at the end of  and  respectively 
the following table summarizes the loan loss expense for the bank for the years ended december   and analysis of the allowance for loan losses amounts in thousands balance at beginning of the period charge offs domestic commercial loans real estate mortgages installment loans subtotal recoveries domestic commercial loans real estate mortgages installment loans subtotal net charge offs provision for loan losses balance at end of period ratio of net charge offs during period to average loans outstanding during period analysis of the allowance for loan losses amounts in thousands allocated portion of allowance percentage of loans in each at december category to total loans loan category domestic commercial loans real estate mortgages installment loans unallocated n a n a at at december  december  total loans   reserve for loan losses   reserve loans excludes loans held for sale 
the bank s overall loan portfolio is geographically concentrated in ann arbor and the future performance of these loans is dependent upon the performance of relatively limited geographical areas 
as a result of the weak michigan economy  the bank s future loss ratios may exceed historical loss ratios 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio  although the ultimate adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is dependent upon future economic factors beyond our control 
a downturn in the general nationwide economy will tend to aggravate  for example  the problems of local loan customers currently facing some difficulties 
a general nationwide business expansion could result in fewer loan customers being unable to repay their loans 
non interest income and non interest expense non interest income 
total non interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for period ended in the decrease was principally a result of decreases in loan origination and gain on the sales of mortgage loans at midwest 
in  the rates on mortgages were historically low which spurred an increase in the re financing market 
in  the rates were still relatively low  but the re financing activity decreased significantly 
the bank s wholly owned insurance and investment subsidiary  university insurance investment services  enjoyed a record year  producing  in fee income compared to  a increase 
non interest income was  in compared to  in income generated in this category is principally from midwest 
during  the mortgage re financing market was stimulated by record low long term interest rates 
midwest and the bank significantly increased income from loan origination  loan sub servicing fee income  and gain on the sale of mortgage loans originated for sale into the secondary market 
university insurance investment services produced  in fee income compared to  a increase 
mortgage banking 
at december   midwest was sub servicing  mortgages  an increase of from  mortgages at december  the balance of loans sub serviced was billion at december  as compared with over billion at december  mortgage banking  servicing and origination fees  and gain on the sale of loans decreased to  in from  in in  the market for mortgage refinancing was extremely active due to historically low rates 
in  mortgage refinancing activity curtailed sharply 
in  mortgage rates are expected to rise and this will further retard the re financing market 
midwest has devoted significant resources during to diversify its mortgage originations away from the refinancing market and to increase the volume of its purchase business by establishing the lehman brothers conduit and by increasing the number of credit unions that originate mortgages through midwest s outsourcing origination services mortgage banking  servicing and origination fees  and gain on the sale of loans increased to  in from  in in  midwest originated mortgage loans  an increase of over last year 
during the year  midwest increased its credit union partners so that at year end it had credit union partners with a total of  active members   potential members and aggregate assets of billion 
securities 
proceeds from sales of marketable and non marketable equity securities included in proceeds from sales of investment securities was  for the year ended december  gross losses of were realized in this period 
proceeds from sales of available for sale debt securities were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  excluding sales associated with the bank s mortgage banking operation 
there were gross gains of  and  on  and sales  respectively and a gross loss of  on sales 
at december  gross unrealized losses in our available for sale securities were  and gross unrealized gains were at december  gross unrealized losses in our available for sale securities were  and gross unrealized gains were non interest expense 
non interest expense decreased to  in the period ended december  from  for the same period in the decrease was due principally to decreases in salaries and benefits  mortgage banking expense  and amortization of servicing rights 
the higher mortgage interest rates in resulted in lower income from mortgage origination as well as lower expenses 
these decreases in costs were partially offset by an increase in other real estate owned expense and an impairment charge as noted previously 
in  non interest expenses increased by  or to  million from  in all but  of the increase was due to increased non interest expenses at midwest  as midwest s origination and sub servicing activity increased 
as the volume expanded midwest increased its workforce to perform the required tasks 
other servicing and sub servicing related expenses  such as occupancy  supplies and postage also increased 
non interest expense was also impacted by an increase in the amortization of the mortgage servicing rights due to the low long term interest rate environment 
personnel expenses at community banking were higher due to higher commissions paid to mortgage and deposit origination personnel 
income taxes income tax expense benefit in was  and  and in and the tax benefit recognized in was reversed in because of the operating loss recognized during the year and uncertainty of recoverability of the deferred tax asset 
the tax benefit was recognized because of the operating profit in  and therefore a portion of existing net operating loss carry forwards were reasonably expected to reduce future amounts of taxable income 
in no tax benefit was realized due to prior period net taxable losses from operations and uncertainties of future taxable income 
the effective tax benefit rate was or  for and for at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized to shelter approximately  of future taxable income 
realization of income tax benefits are not recorded in the financial statements as realization of these benefits is dependent upon generating sufficient future taxable income

item a 
market risk impact of inflation the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
since our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general effects of inflation 
however  to the extent that inflation affects interest rates  it also affects our net income 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all financial institutions are significantly affected by fluctuations in interest rates commonly referred to as interest rate risk 
the principal exposure of a financial institution s earnings to interest rate risk is the difference in time between interest rate adjustments or maturities on interest earning assets compared to the time between interest rate adjustments or maturities on interest bearing liabilities 
this difference is commonly referred to as a financial institution s gap position 
in periods when interest rates are increasing  a negative gap position will result in generally lower earnings as long term assets are repricing upward slower than short term liabilities 
however during a declining rate environment  the opposite effect on earnings is true  with earnings rising due to long term assets repricing downward slower than short term liabilities 
rising long term and short term interest rates tend to increase the value of midwest investment in mortgage servicing rights and improve midwest current return on these rights by lowering required amortization rates on the rights and decreasing the opportunity for customers to refinance those loans 
rising interest rates tend to decrease new mortgage origination activity  negatively impacting current income from the bank s retail mortgage banking operations and midwest s mortgage banking operations 
rising interest rates also slow midwest rate of growth  but increases the duration of its existing mortgages being sub serviced under contract 
the bank s securities portfolio is designed to offset a portion of the market value risk associated with the servicing rights 
during period of declining interest rates  the estimated duration period for the bank s fnma cmo tends to shorten  thus accelerating the income from the accretion of the bond s discount 
this income mitigates the rapid amortization of the servicing rights 
in a rising rate environment  the accretion of income on the bond tends to lessen
