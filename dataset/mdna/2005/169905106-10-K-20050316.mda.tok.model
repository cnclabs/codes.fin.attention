the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand choice hotels international  inc and subsidiaries together the company 
md a is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
overview we are a hotel franchisor with franchise agreements representing  hotels open and hotels under development as of december   with  rooms and  rooms  respectively  in states and more than countries and territories outside the united states 
our brand names include comfort inn  comfort suites  quality  clarion  sleep inn  econo lodge  rodeway inn  mainstay suites  cambria suites and flag hotels 
the company s franchises operate in states and more than countries and territories outside of the united states 
approximately of the company s revenues are derived from hotels franchised in the united states 
our company generates revenues  income and cash flows primarily from initial and continuing royalty fees attributable to our franchise agreements 
revenues are also generated from partner services endorsed vendor arrangements  hotel operations and other sources 
we are contractually required by our franchise agreements to use the marketing and reservation fees we collect for system wide marketing and reservation activities 
these expenditures  which include advertising costs 
table of contents and costs to maintain our central reservations system  help to enhance awareness and increase consumer preference for our brands 
greater awareness and preference promotes long term growth in business delivery to our franchisees  which ultimately increases franchise fees earned by the company 
our company articulates its mission as a commitment to provide hotel franchises that strive to generate the highest return on investment 
we have developed an operating system dedicated to our franchisees success one that focuses on delivering guests to our franchised hotels and reducing costs for our hotel owners 
more specifically  through our actions we strive every day to continuously improve our franchise offerings to create the highest return on investment of any hotel franchise 
we believe that executing our strategic priorities creates value 
our company focuses on two key value drivers profitable growth 
our success is dependent on improving the performance of our hotels and increasing our system size by selling additional hotel franchises 
we attempt to improve our franchisees revenues and overall profitability by providing a variety of products and services designed to increase business delivery to and or reduce operating and development costs for our franchisees 
these products and services include national marketing campaigns  a central reservation system  property and yield management systems  quality assurance standards and endorsed vendor relationships 
we believe that healthy brands which deliver a compelling return on investment for franchisees will enable us to sell additional hotel franchises 
we have established multiple brands that meet the needs of many types of guests  and can be developed at various price points and applied to both new and existing hotels 
this ensures that we have brands suitable for creating growth in a variety of market conditions 
improving the performance of the hotels under franchise and growing the system through additional franchise sales while maintaining a disciplined cost structure are the keys to profitable growth 
maximizing financial returns and creating value for shareholders 
our capital allocation decisions  including capital structure and uses of capital  are intended to maximize our return on invested capital and create value for our shareholders 
we believe our strong and predictable cash flows create a strong financial position that provides us a competitive advantage 
our business does not require significant capital to operate and grow  therefore  we can maintain a capital structure that generates high financial returns and use our excess cash flow to increase returns to our shareholders 
we have returned value to our shareholders in two primary ways share repurchases and dividends 
in  we instituted a share repurchase program which has generated substantial value for our shareholders 
we have repurchased million shares of common stock at a total cost of million  or an average price of per share since the program s inception 
our cash flows from operations support our ability to complete the repurchase of approximately million shares presently remaining under our current board of director s authorization 
upon completion of the current authorization we will evaluate the propriety of additional share repurchases with our board of directors 
in  we initiated a cash dividend on our common stock 
during  we paid dividends totaling approximately million and we presently expect to continue to pay dividends in the future 
based on our present dividend rate and outstanding share count  aggregate annual dividends would be approximately million 
we believe these value drivers  when properly implemented  will enhance our profitability  maximize our financial returns and continue to generate value for our shareholders 
the ultimate measure of our success will be reflected in the items below 
results of operation royalty fees  operating income  net income and diluted earnings per share represent key measurements of these value drivers 
in  royalty fees revenue and operating income totaled approximately million and million respectively  increases of approximately from net income for the year ended december  increased to million  an increase of million over the year ended december  diluted earnings per share were  a improvement over resulting from increased net income and a reduction in the number of shares outstanding attributable to our share repurchase program 
net income and diluted earnings per share in include a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately million million  net of the related tax effect related to the refinancing of the 
table of contents company s senior credit facility 
net income and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  include a million gain and million million  net of the related tax effect of interest income attributable to a note receivable from sunburst hospitality corporation sunburst  which was repaid to the company in december these measurements will continue to be a key management focus in and beyond 
refer to md a heading operations review for additional analysis of our results 
liquidity and capital resources the company generates significant cash flows from operations 
in and  net cash provided by operating activities was million and million  respectively 
since our business does not require significant reinvestment of capital  we utilize cash in ways that management believes provide the greatest returns to our shareholders which include share repurchases and dividends 
we believe the company s cash flow from operations and available financing capacity are sufficient to meet the expected future operating  investing and financing needs of the business 
refer to md a heading liquidity and capital resources for additional analysis 
the principal factors that affect the company s results are the number and relative mix of franchised hotels  growth in the number of hotels under franchise  occupancy and room rates achieved by the hotels under franchise  the effective royalty rate achieved  and our ability to manage costs 
the number of rooms at franchised properties and occupancy and room rates at those properties significantly affect the company s results because our fees are based upon room revenues at franchised hotels 
the key industry standard for measuring hotel operating performance is revenue per available room revpar  which is calculated by multiplying the percentage of occupied rooms by the average daily room rate realized 
our variable overhead costs associated with franchise system growth have historically been less than incremental royalty fees generated from new franchises 
accordingly  continued growth of our franchise business should enable us to realize benefits from the operating leverage in place and improve operating results

critical accounting policies our accounting policies comply with principles generally accepted in the united states 
we have described below those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment or significant estimates in their application 
additional discussion of these policies is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize continuing franchise fees  including royalty  marketing and reservations fees  when earned and receivable from our franchisees 
franchise fees are typically based on a percentage of gross room revenues of each franchisee 
our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible royalty fees is charged to selling  general and administrative expense 
initial franchise and relicensing fees are recognized  in most instances  in the period the related franchise agreement is executed because the initial franchise fee is non refundable and the company has no continuing obligations related to the franchisee 
we defer the initial franchise fee revenue related to franchise agreements which include incentives until the incentive criteria are met or the agreement is terminated  whichever occurs first 

table of contents we account for partner services revenues from endorsed vendors in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 sab revenue recognition 
sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
pursuant to sab  the company recognizes partner services revenues when the services are performed or the product delivered  evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
we defer the recognition of partner services revenues related to certain upfront fees and recognize them over a period corresponding to the company s estimate of the life of the arrangement 
marketing and reservation revenues and expenses 
the company records marketing and reservation revenues and expenses in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  which requires that these revenues and expenses be recorded gross 
in addition  net advances to and repayments from the franchise system for marketing and reservation activities are presented as cash flows from operating activities 
reservation fees and marketing fees not expended in the current year are carried over to the next fiscal year and expended in accordance with the franchise agreements 
shortfall amounts are similarly recovered in subsequent years 
cumulative excess or shortfall amounts from the operation of these programs are recorded as a marketing or reservation fee payable or receivable 
under the terms of the franchise agreements  the company may advance capital as necessary for marketing and reservation activities and recover such advances through future fees 
our current assessment is that the credit risk associated with the marketing and reservation fee receivable is mitigated due to our contractual right to recover these amounts from a large geographically dispersed group of franchisees 
choice privileges is our frequent guest incentive marketing program 
choice privileges enables members to earn points based on their spending levels at participating brands and  to a lesser degree  through participation in affiliated partners programs  such as those offered by credit card companies 
the points may be redeemed for free accommodations or other benefits 
points cannot be redeemed for cash 
the company collects a percentage of program members room revenue from participating franchises 
revenues are deferred equal to the fair value of the future redemption obligation 
a third party actuary estimates the eventual redemption rates and point values using various actuarial methods 
these judgmental factors determine the required liability for outstanding points 
upon redemption of the points  the company recognizes the previously deferred revenue as well as the corresponding expense relating to the cost of the awards redeemed 
revenues in excess of the estimated future redemption obligation are recognized when earned to reimburse the company for costs incurred to operate the program  including administrative costs  marketing  promotion and performing member services 
costs to operate the program  excluding estimated redemption values  are expensed when incurred 
impairment policy 
we evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis  or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset 
we evaluate impairment of goodwill by comparing the fair value of our net assets with the carrying amount of goodwill 
we evaluate the potential impairment of property and equipment and other long lived assets  including franchise rights whenever an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying value of the asset 
our evaluation is based upon future cash flow projections 
these projections reflect management s best assumptions and estimates 
significant management judgment is involved in developing these projections  and they include inherent uncertainties 
if different projections had been used in the current period  the balances for non current assets could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if management uses different projections or if different conditions occur in future periods  future operating results could be 
table of contents materially impacted 
the company reviews outstanding notes receivable on a periodic basis to ensure that each is fully collectible by reviewing the financial condition of its debtors 
if the company concludes that it will be unable to collect all amounts due  the company will record an impairment charge

r is not expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
income taxes 
our income tax expense and related balance sheet amounts involve significant management estimates and judgments 
judgments regarding realization of deferred tax assets and the ultimate outcome of tax related contingencies represent key items involved in the determination of income tax expense and related balance sheet accounts 
the company does not provide additional united states income taxes on undistributed earnings of consolidated foreign subsidiaries included in retained earnings 
such earnings could become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of these foreign subsidiaries or upon dividend repatriation 
the company s intent is for such earnings to be reinvested by the subsidiaries or to be repatriated only when required for domestic business operations  tax or cash reasons 
on october   the american jobs creation act of ajca was signed into law 
the ajca includes a temporary incentive for united states multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated income of foreign subsidiaries by providing an percent dividends received deduction for qualifying dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
our income tax expense does not reflect the impact of the ajca 
we have begun an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provisions and expect to complete the analysis prior to the end of the third quarter deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which we have already properly recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
realization of our deferred tax assets reflects our tax planning strategies 
we establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we do not believe will be realized 
tax assessments and resolution of tax contingencies may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
predicting the outcome of such tax assessments involves uncertainty  however  we believe that recorded tax liabilities adequately account for our analysis of probable outcomes
