marketing 
our marketing philosophy is to sell profitable business in our core states  using a focused  multi channeled  cost effective distribution system 
in  our captive agents generated of our premiums  independent agents generated and we produced of premiums on a direct basis without agent involvement 
in addition to our agency force  we have built our sales and marketing efforts around several strategic business alliances 
these alliances include medical society endorsements  purchasing group programs and other marketing alliances 
our medical professional liability product line is marketed through approximately agents in states  with one strategic partner  scw agency group  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  kentucky medical agency  collectively referred to as scw 
this agency accounted for approximately of medical professional liability direct premiums written during this relationship is discussed in more detail in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations important agency relationship 
the vast majority of our remaining agents who write our medical professional liability insurance are independent agents 
due to the highly specialized nature of medical professional liability insurance  we are working to build a controlled distribution system to increase the percentage of our business that is produced through captive agents  which protects the company and makes us less vulnerable to changes in market conditions 
we also work with financially sound agencies that focus on this line in targeted geographic areas 
our top ten agencies produced million of direct premiums written  or of total premium writings in the michigan state medical society  or msms  has endorsed american physicians as its exclusive professional liability carrier of choice for years 
we compensate msms for marketing our professional medical liability products to msms members 
american physicians is also endorsed by the michigan osteopathic association  the new mexico medical society  several specialty societies and numerous physician organizations 
underwriting and pricing 
most of our initial underwriting work and customer contact is performed through a centralized process based in our home office 
the home office underwriting department has final responsibility for the issuance  establishment and implementation of underwriting standards for all of our underwritten coverages 
the local office underwriting staff have the authority to evaluate  approve and issue medical professional liability coverage for individual providers and medical groups with annual premiums that do not exceed present threshold amounts or guidelines imposed by the home office 
through our management and actuarial staff  we regularly establish rates and rating classifications for our physician and medical group insureds based on the loss and loss adjustment expense  or lae  experience we have developed over the past years  and the loss and lae experience for the entire medical professional 
table of contents liability market 
we have various rating classifications based on practice location  medical specialty and other liability factors 
we also utilize various discounts  such as claim free credits  to encourage low risk  high profit physicians to insure with american physicians 
the nature of our business requires that we remain sensitive to the marketplace and the pricing strategies of our competitors 
using the market information as our background  we normally set our prices based on our estimated future costs 
from time to time  we may reduce our discounts or apply a premium surcharge to achieve an appropriate return 
pricing flexibility allows us to provide a fair rate commensurate with the assumed liability 
if our pricing strategy cannot yield sufficient premium to cover our costs on a particular type of risk  we may determine not to underwrite that risk 
it is our philosophy not to sacrifice profitability for premium growth 
claims management 
our policies require us to provide a defense for our insureds in any suit involving a medical incident covered by the policy 
the defense costs we incur are in addition to the limit of liability under the policy 
medical professional liability claims often involve the evaluation of highly technical medical issues  severe injuries and conflicting expert opinions 
our strategy for handling medical professional liability claims combines a basic philosophy of vigorously defending against non meritorious claims with an overall commitment to providing outstanding service to our insured physicians and hospitals 
our claims department is responsible for claims investigation  establishment of appropriate case reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses  defense planning and coordination  working closely with attorneys engaged by us to defend a claim and negotiation of the settlement or other disposition of a claim 
we emphasize early evaluation and aggressive management of claims 
a part of our overall claims strategy is to establish regional claims departments in our major markets 
this local presence helps to facilitate better defense attorney coordination by allowing us to meet with defense attorneys and policyholders  and attend trials  as well as develop claims staff that have experience with the region s legal environment  which enables us to more accurately establish case reserves 
when a claim is reported  a claims department professional completes an initial evaluation and sets the initial reserve 
as the discovery process continues  the reserve may be adjusted 
we have established different levels of authority within the claims department for settlement of claims 
other insurance starting in the fourth quarter of  we began to exit the workers compensation line 
we non renewed all policies as of their anniversary date in the process of non renewing policies was substantially completed on june  however  at december   we still had approximately million of net unearned premium that will be earned into on policies which were written during the first half of we currently write small business employee health insurance through a single preferred provider organization located in western michigan 
however  in late  we made the decision to exit this line 
we began non renewing policies july  thus  we will continue to have written and earned premiums through the first half of we previously sold personal and commercial insurance 
we are no longer accepting new business in this line of business and have not renewed business previously written by us in this line

in november  am best reduced the financial strength rating of the apcapital group of companies from a to b 
this downgrade was directly attributable to our third quarter loss announced november  at that time  am best put our rating under further review with a negative outlook pending completion of their analysis 
in january  am best reduced the financial strength rating of american physicians and apspecialty to b  based on their lower capitalization 
our insurance corporation of america subsidiary was given a b rating due to its change in status to a workers compensation run off company 
an insurance company s rating  and particularly its am best rating  is a potential source of competitive advantage or disadvantage in the marketplace 
although any rating downgrade may make it more difficult for us to sell our insurance products  the reduction of our am best rating has not had a material adverse impact on our business to date 
however  further downgrades could have a material adverse impact on our business 
rating agencies such as am best evaluate insurance companies based on their financial strength and ability to pay claims  factors which are more relevant to policyholders and potential customers who are purchasing insurance  and agents who are advising customers  than investors 
financial strength ratings by rating agencies are not ratings of securities or recommendations to buy  hold  or sell any security 
other financial subsidiaries we have developed and acquired a variety of other organizations to offer financial services and consulting to our customers 
these services include captive insurance company arrangements and investment management 
revenues from these sources are not material 
reinsurance in accordance with industry practice  we cede to other insurance companies some of the potential liability under insurance policies we have underwritten 
this practice  called reinsurance  helps us reduce our net liability on individual risks  stabilize our underwriting results and increase our underwriting capacity 
however  if the reinsurer fails to meet its obligations  we remain liable for policyholder obligations 
we pay our reinsurers a percentage of the premium on the related policies for sharing a portion of the risk associated with these policies 
we determine the amount and scope of reinsurance coverage to purchase each year based upon an evaluation of the risks accepted  consultations with reinsurance brokers and a review of market conditions  including the availability and pricing of reinsurance 
our reinsurance arrangements are generally renegotiated annually 
under our primary professional liability reinsurance contract  the portion of the policyholder premium ceded to the reinsurers is swing rated  or experience rated on a retrospective basis 
this swing rated contract is subject to a minimum and maximum premium range to be paid to the reinsurers in the future  depending upon the extent of losses actually paid by the reinsurers 
we pay a provisional premium during the initial policy year 
a liability is recorded to represent an estimate of net additional payments to be made to the reinsurers under the program  based on the level of loss and lae reserves recorded 
during  our largest net insured amount on any medical professional liability risk is  our net retention in workers compensation  in states other than minnesota  is million 
in minnesota  insurers are required to obtain reinsurance from a state facility called the workers compensation reinsurance association  or wcra 
our current net retention on any one claim with respect to the wcra is  to take advantage of emerging markets  we have also utilized quota share reinsurance in the recent past  where we proportionately share the premium and losses with the reinsurer 

table of contents the following table identifies our principal reinsurers  their percentage participation in our aggregate reinsured risk based upon amounts recoverable and their respective am best ratings as of december  am best classifies an a rating as excellent and a and a ratings as superior

this review includes a ratings analysis of each reinsurer participating in a reinsurance contract 
on the basis of this review  as of december   we concluded that there was no material risk of not being paid by our reinsurers 
we believe that our reinsurance is maintained with financially stable reinsurers 
however  we continue to monitor closely the cash flows and surplus levels of pma capital insurance company and converium reinsurance na  inc due to recent announcements made by those companies regarding their status 
our inability to collect on our reinsurance  or the inability of our reinsurers to make payments under the terms of reinsurance  due to insolvency or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves our insurance subsidiaries are required by applicable insurance laws and regulations to maintain reserves for payment of losses and loss adjustment expenses for reported claims and for claims incurred but not reported  arising from policies that have been issued 
generally  these laws and regulations require that we provide for the ultimate cost of those claims without regard to how long it takes to settle them or the time value of money 
we are also required to maintain reserves on a physician s death  disability and retirement  or dd r reserves  which are included in our loss reserves 
the determination of reserves involves actuarial and statistical projections of what we expect to be the cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of such claims based on facts and circumstances then known  estimates of future trends in claims severity  and other variable factors such as inflation and changing judicial theories of liability 
with the exception of our reserves for extended reporting period claims  we do not discount our reserves to recognize for the time value of money 
reserves for extended reporting period claims were million at december   and included a discount of approximately million 
the effect of pre tax income of discount accrued and amortized was not significant 
when a claim is reported to us  claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
this estimate reflects an informed judgment based upon insurance reserving practices appropriate for the relevant line of business and on the experience and knowledge of the estimator regarding the nature and value of the specific claim  the severity of injury or damage  and the policy provisions relating to the type of loss 
case reserves are periodically adjusted by the claims staff  as more information becomes available 
the estimation of ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses is an inherently uncertain process and does not represent an exact calculation of that liability 
we maintain reserves for claims incurred but not reported to provide for future reporting of already incurred claims and developments on reported claims 
the reserve for claims incurred but not reported is determined based on historical loss trends 
we have actuaries on our staff that analyze and develop projections of ultimate losses which are used to establish recorded reserves 
our actuaries utilized standard actuarial techniques to project ultimate losses based on our paid and incurred loss information  as well as drawing from industry data 
these projections are 
table of contents done using actual loss dollars and claim counts 
we analyze loss trends and claims frequency and severity to determine our best estimate of the required reserves 
we then record this best estimate in the company s financial statements 
as required by insurance regulatory authorities  we receive an annual statement of opinion by an independent consulting actuary concerning the adequacy of our reserves 
typically  as of the end of the third quarter of each year  our independent actuary performs an initial analysis of our reserves and provides us with a preliminary indication of what the actuary believes is the appropriate level for our recorded reserves 
after year end  the independent actuary performs a much more in depth analysis on the basis of which the actuary renders an opinion regarding the adequacy of our reserves 
as part of this year end analysis  the independent actuary determines a range of reserve estimates  based on its projection methodologies  and a select amount within the range 
if our recorded reserves are materially less than the independent actuary s select amount  we adjust reserves so that they are near or above their select amount 
this independent review of our reserves is one of the key factors that we rely on in our overall assessment of the adequacy of our reserves 
to the extent that the independent actuary s projections produce results similar to those we have developed internally  we can be reasonably assured that our assumptions and methodologies used to project ultimate losses are adequate 
the following table provides a reconciliation  prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  of beginning and ending loss and loss adjustment expense reserve balances for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands balance  beginning of year less  reinsurance recoverables net balance  beginning of year incurred related to current year prior years total incurred paid related to current year prior years total paid net balance  end of year plus  reinsurance recoverables balance  end of period during   and  management made adjustments to prior year reserves 
these adverse adjustments totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
as a percentage of net reserves as of the beginning of the year  these adjustments were   and  respectively 
during  we commuted a reinsurance treaty with one of our reinsurers  gerling global reinsurance corporation of america  or gerling 
this commutation resulted in million of prior year adverse development 
in addition  the company incurred million of adverse development on other insurance reserves 
this adverse development was caused by slower than expected closure rates on run off claims 
this adverse development was offset by million positive prior year development on medical professional liability reserves  which was the result of favorable claim settlement patterns in our ohio and michigan markets 

table of contents during  the company experienced a sharp increase in the severity of paid losses in our medical professional liability segment  which indicated a much higher trend in claims severity 
as a result  actuarial projections resulted in higher ultimate severities of loss on currently existing claims related to the through accident years  which resulted in management increasing its estimate of incurred but not reported claims related to the through accident years by approximately million in the unfavorable development in was primarily related to our ohio million  florida million and kentucky million markets  partially offset by positive development of million in the michigan market 
we announced  and began our exit from the florida market in and also discontinued writing occurrence based policies in the ohio and kentucky markets in we increased prior year loss reserves in  primarily in our ohio and florida medical professional liability markets due to higher than anticipated severity 
the following table shows the development of the net liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses from through the top line of the table shows the original estimated liabilities at the balance sheet date  including losses incurred but not yet reported 
the upper portion of the table shows the cumulative amounts subsequently paid as of successive year ends with respect to the liability 
the lower portion of the table shows the re estimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year 
the estimates change as claims settle and more information becomes known about the ultimate frequency and severity of claims for individual years 
the deficiency or redundancy exists when the re estimated liability at each december is greater or less than the prior liability estimate 
the cumulative deficiency or redundancy depicted in the table  for any particular calendar year  represents the aggregate change in the initial estimates over all subsequent calendar years 

table of contents the volatility of professional liability claim frequency and severity makes the prediction of the ultimate loss very difficult 
likewise  the long time frame for professional liability claims to develop and be paid further complicates the reserving process 
liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses net of reinsurance recoverable cumulative net paid as of end of year two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later re estimated net liability as of end of year two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later net cumulative deficiency redundancy gross liability end of year reinsurance recoverables net liability end of year gross re estimated liability latest re estimated reinsurance recoverables latest net re estimated liability latest gross cumulative deficiency redundancy during  the gerling global reinsurance corporation gerling commuted their reinsurance contracts with apcapital 
the transaction produced a net loss of million on prior years reserves as a result of apcapital reassuming gerling s obligation for loss and lae in return for consideration which was discounted for the time value of money 
for illustrative purposes  the following cumulative deficiency redundancy amounts exclude the effect of prior year development due to the gerling commutation net cumulative deficiency redundancy excluding gerling commutation 
table of contents as the above table shows  the company experienced adverse development on its net loss and lae reserves excluding the effect of gerling global of million 
the adverse development was the result of million development from the other lines segment offset by million from the professional liability segment 
the other lines segment development was primarily caused by workers compensation reserves developing worse than expected 
the company has made a concerted effort to strengthen case reserves in however  the company also observed a slowdown in the closing of claims with a concurrent an increase in the average paid per closed claim 
for professional liability  the company observed favorable development because of lower than expected paid severity  most notably in the ohio and michigan markets 
in evaluating the information in the table above  it should be noted that each column includes the effects of changes in amounts for prior periods 
the table does not present accident year or policy year development data 
conditions and trends that have affected the development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table 
reserve ranges in an effort to better explain the inherent uncertainty in our net loss and lae reserves  we have developed a reasonable range of estimates around the net carried reserves 
our ranges in the table below were primarily established by reviewing the various actuarial methods used to estimate net loss and lae reserves 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations significant accounting policies unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for further information regarding these various actuarial methods 
net loss and lae reserves medical professional other liability insurance total in thousands low end of range carried reserves high end of range there are several limitations to interpreting reserve ranges which apply in this situation 
the totals in the above table do not necessarily have the same probabilities as the individual ranges by segment as the segments themselves may not be independent 
for example  if workers compensation medical loss costs increase at a rate greater than expected  professional liability loss costs  of which a component is the cost of medical care  may also increase 
there are also macroeconomic effects that may cause professional liability loss costs to increase at a more rapid rate due to the prospect of tort reform  which likely will have little or no impact on workers compensation loss costs 
other macroeconomic effects which may have differing effects by segment include  but are not limited to  changes in the litigiousness of jurisdictions in which we write business  changes in unemployment rates by geographic location  the influence of legislative actions  and changes in political philosophy 
as a result of these factors as well as other unknown factors  there can be no assurance that reserves will develop within these ranges 
the likelihood of reserves emerging differently than the carried reserves diminish as you approach the low and high end of the ranges 
however it is meaningful to note the potential variability in the company s net income before the effect of income taxes if reserves develop to either the low or high end 
the following table shows the effects on pre tax net income if the carried reserves as of december  actually prove to be at the low or high end of the range impact on pre tax income low end of range high end of range 
table of contents statutory vs 
gaap reserves statutory accounting principles require reserves to be reported on a net basis  ie  after reinsurance 
gaap requires reserves to be reported on a gross basis  ie  before reinsurance  with a corresponding asset established for the reinsurance recoverable 
when compared on a net basis  our statutory and gaap reserves are identical  with the exception of the reserves for extended reporting endorsements  approximately million  which are required to be carried as unearned premium reserves for statutory accounting purposes 
investments an important component of our operating results has been the total return on invested assets 
our investment objectives are primarily to maximize current returns  and to generate long term capital appreciation that can ultimately be converted to current income 
we are pursuing these objectives  while maintaining safety of capital  with an emphasis on adequate liquidity for our insurance operations 
all of our investment securities are classified as available for sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
as of december   all of our fixed income investment portfolio  excluding approximately million  or of the total fixed income investment portfolio  of private placement issues  was investment grade 
our fixed income portfolio is managed by one of our subsidiaries 
for additional information regarding our investment results  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
other invested assets include investment real estate and investment real estate limited partnerships 
competition the insurance industry is highly competitive 
we compete with numerous insurance companies and various self insurance mechanisms 
many of our competitors have considerably greater financial resources and higher am best company ratings than we have 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in all of our insurance segments are service quality  name recognition  breadth and flexibility of coverages  financial stability and  to a lesser degree  price 
we believe we compare favorably to many of our competitors based on our excellent service to customers  our close relationship with the medical community  primarily through various medical societies  which affords us a high degree of name recognition  our ability to customize product features and programs to fit the needs of our customers and our long history of financial stability 
these factors will vary by state based on the relative strength of our competitors in each market 
an insurance company s rating  and in particular its am best rating  is a potential source of competitive advantage or disadvantage in the marketplace 
although our rating downgrades in and may negatively affect our ability to compete in the future  the reduction of our am best rating has not had a material adverse impact on our business to date 
segment information see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for information regarding our business segments 
such information is incorporated herein by reference 
insurance regulatory matters general 
insurance companies are subject to supervision and regulation relating to numerous aspects of their business and financial condition in the states in which they transact business 
the nature and extent of such regulation varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
our michigan insurance companies  for example  are subject to supervision and regulation by the office of financial and insurance services for the state of michigan  ofis  and other state departments of insurance 
these regulators establish standards of solvency  licenses insurers and agents  establishes guidelines for investments by insurers  reviews premium rates  reviews the provisions which insurers must make for current losses and future liabilities  reviews transactions involving a change in control and requires the filing of periodic reports relating to financial condition 
in addition  state regulatory examiners  including ofis  perform periodic financial examinations of insurance companies 
such regulation is generally intended for the protection of policyholders rather than shareholders 

table of contents our insurance subsidiaries together are licensed to write insurance in a total of states and are eligible to write excess and surplus lines in states 
however  we currently write excess and surplus business in only of the states where we are licensed or eligible 
our current focus of operations is on our existing states 
holding company regulation 
most states  including michigan  have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems such as ours 
each insurance company in a holding company system is required to register with the insurance supervisory agency of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers within the system 
these laws permit ofis or any other relevant insurance departments to examine apcapital s insurance subsidiaries at any time  to require disclosure of material transactions between apcapital and its insurance subsidiaries  and to require prior approval of sales or purchases of a material amount of assets and the payment of extraordinary dividends 
ofis conducted a financial examination as of december  of each of our three insurance subsidiaries 
no adjustments were proposed as a result of the examinations 
holding company laws also limit the amount of dividends payable by insurance subsidiaries to the parent company 
under michigan law  the maximum dividend that may be paid to apcapital from its insurance subsidiaries during any twelve month period  without prior approval of ofis  is the greater of of each insurance company s statutory surplus  as reported on the most recent annual statement filed with ofis  or the statutory net income  excluding realized gains  for the period covered by such annual statement 
at december   the amount available for payment of dividends without the prior approval of ofis was approximately million 
change of control 
the michigan insurance code requires that ofis receive prior notice of and approve a change of control for apcapital or any of its michigan domiciled insurance subsidiaries 
the michigan insurance code contains a complete definition of control 
in simplified terms  a person  corporation  or other entity would obtain control of american physicians or apcapital if they possessed  had a right to acquire possession  or had the power to direct any other person acquiring possession  directly or indirectly  of or more of the voting securities of either company 
in addition  our plan of conversion provides that no one may acquire more than of the common shares outstanding of apcapital before december  without ofis approval 
to obtain approval for a change of control  the proposed acquirer must file an application with ofis containing detailed information such as the identity and background of the acquirer and its affiliates  the sources of and amount of funds to be used to effect the acquisition  and financial information regarding the proposed acquirer 
risk based capital requirements 
in addition to other state imposed insurance laws and regulations  ofis enforces requirements developed by the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  that require insurance companies to calculate and report information under a risk based formula that attempts to measure capital and surplus needs based on the risks in a company s mix of products and investment portfolio 
under the formula  we first determine our risk based capital base level by taking into account risks with respect to our assets and underwriting risks relating to our liabilities and obligations 
we then compare our total adjusted capital to the base level 
our total adjusted capital is determined by subtracting our liabilities from our assets in accordance with rules established by ofis 
a ratio of total adjusted capital to risk based capital of less than may give rise to enhanced regulatory scrutiny or even a regulatory takeover of the insurer  depending on the extent to which the ratio is less than the ratio for our primary insurance subsidiary  american physicians  has always exceeded in the past  but there can be no assurance that the requirements applicable to american physicians will not increase in the future 
as of december   american physicians risk based capital base level was million and its total adjusted capital was million  for a ratio of the ratio of risk based capital to total adjusted capital for our other two insurance subsidiaries  apspecialty and insurance corporation of america  was and respectively  at december  iris requirements 
the naic has also developed a set of financial ratios  referred to as the insurance regulatory information system  or iris  for use by state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies 
the naic has established an acceptable range of values for each of the 
table of contents iris financial ratios 
generally  an insurance company will become the subject of increased scrutiny when four or more of its iris ratio results fall outside the range deemed acceptable by the naic 
the nature of increased regulatory scrutiny resulting from iris ratio results outside the acceptable range is subject to the judgment of the applicable state insurance department  but generally will result in accelerated reviews of annual and quarterly filings 
in  our insurance company subsidiaries generated certain ratios that varied from values within the naic s acceptable range 
the variations and reasons for the variations are set forth in the table below ratios by company usual range value company apspecialty insurance corporation change in net writings company insurance corporation of america change in net writings two year overall operating ratio change in policyholders surplus one year reserve development to policyholders surplus two year reserve development to policyholders surplus company american physicians assurance corporation change in net writings two year overall operating ratio change in policyholders surplus two year reserve development to policyholders surplus the increase in apspecialty s net premiums written is primarily the result of a novation that resulted in certain reserve and unearned premium balances being transferred to its sister companies  ica and american physicians 
the novation  which is an outright transfer of the rights and obligations associated with the policies affected  was completed to align the company s major lines of business within specific insurance companies 
in connection with the novation  written and earned premiums equal to the novated reserve and unearned premium balances were also transferred  which resulted in a reduction of net premiums written of million 
without the effects of the novation  the results of this ratio would have been  which is within the normal range 
this ratio is outside of the acceptable range due to discontinuing the workers compensation line beginning in  as well as the additional million in net premiums written recorded as a result of the novation described above 
ica s two year operating ratio is elevated because of million adverse development reported for workers compensation  and is further complicated by the novation 
when the balances were novated  losses equal to the reserves transferred were incurred along with an equal amount of earned premiums  which resulted in a loss ratio of on a significant portion of ica s business recorded during the decrease in ica s statutory surplus was primarily the result of an operating loss for the workers compensation line of business 
the ratio would have been worse without the fourth quarter surplus contribution of million from apcapital  ica s parent company 
the one year and two year reserve development to surplus ratios are outside the usual range due to the company s recognition of million adverse development in workers compensation  particularly in the to accident years 
the two year ratio is further impacted by the novation because almost all of the company s workers compensation reserves are now reported on ica  development attributed to this line is also reported on ica 
the two year reserve development compares reserves for accident years and prior to surplus as of december  ica s december  surplus  which was used as the denominator in the calculation  was not proportionate to the december  
table of contents workers compensation reserves  and the corresponding potential for adverse development  which was one of the primary reasons an additional million of surplus was contributed to ica in if ica s december  surplus were used as the denominator in the calculation  the resulting two year development ratio would have been  which is explained primarily by the adverse development in workers compensation 
the change in net writings ratio value of is primarily the result of the novation discussed above  which resulted in a reduction of american physicians net premium writings in related to novated balances of approximately million 
had net premiums written not been reduced in as a result of the novation  the ratio would have been  which is well within the naic s usual range 
the two year overall operating result ratio value of is primarily the result of a two year loss ratio of approximately 
the unusually high loss ratio is a factor of a adverse development on prior year loss reserves of approximately million in  and b a decrease in net premiums earned during of approximately million related to the intercompany novation 
the increase in american physicians statutory surplus was primarily the result of a cash surplus contribution of million in january from its parent  apcapital 
in addition  effective march   apcapital contributed all of the outstanding common stock of its subsidiary apspecialty to american physicians 
the contribution of apspecialty s common stock resulted in a million increase in american physicians surplus 
the two year reserve development to surplus ratio value is outside of the usual range as a result of the significant adverse development on prior year loss reserves in related to the medical professional liability line of business 
guaranty fund 
we participate in various guaranty associations in the states in which we write business that protect policyholders and claimants against losses due to insolvency of insurers 
when an insolvency occurs  the associations are authorized to assess member companies up to the amount of the shortfall of funds  including expenses 
member companies are assessed based on the type and amount of insurance written during the previous calendar year 
we make estimated accruals for our portion of the assessments as information becomes available 
employees as of december   we had employees 
none of the employees are covered by a collective bargaining unit and we believe that employee relations are good

all of our reports filed under the securities exchange act of are available free of charge at our website promptly after they are filed 
in addition  the company s code of ethics covering directors  officers and other employees is also available on our website 
uncertainties relating to forward looking statements we make forward looking statements in this report and may make such statements in future filings with the securities and exchange commission 
we may also make forward looking statements in our press releases or other public or shareholder communications 
our forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and include information about our expectations and possible or assumed future results of our operations 
when we use any of the words believes  expects  anticipates  estimates or similar expressions  we are making forward looking statements 
we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of for all of our forward looking statements 
while we believe that our forward looking statements are reasonable  you should not place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date made 
because these forward looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties  
table of contents many of which are beyond our control or are subject to change  actual results could be materially different 
factors that might cause such a difference include the following the process of estimating the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses involves significant judgment and is complex and imprecise due to the number of variables and assumptions inherent in the estimation process 
these variables include the effects on ultimate loss payments of internal factors such as changes in claims handling practices and changes in the mix of our products  as well as external factors such as changes in loss severity trends  economic inflation  judicial trends and legislative and regulatory changes 
in addition  medical professional liability claims may take several years to resolve due to typical delays in reporting claims to us  the often lengthy discovery process  and the time necessary to defend the claim 
also  claims with similar characteristics may result in very different ultimate losses depending on the state or region where the claim occurred 
all of these factors contribute to the variability in estimating ultimate loss payments  especially since the effects of many of these variables cannot be directly quantified  particularly on a prospective basis 
the assumptions and methodologies used in estimating and establishing the reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are continually reviewed and any adjustments are reflected as income or expense in the period in which the adjustment is made 
any such adjustments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations for the period with respect to which the adjustment is made 
due to the current volatility of losses in the medical professional liability and workers compensation industries  adjustments have occurred in each of the last several years  and additional adjustments may occur in the future 
a deterioration in the current accident year experience could result in a portion or all of our deferred policy acquisition costs not being recoverable  which would result in a charge to income 
our exit from various markets and lines of business  including without limitation our exit from  the workers compensation  health and personal and commercial lines of business  as well as various geographic markets  could result in future charges to income due to unforeseen costs or the need for unanticipated reserve enhancements 
additional reserve enhancements may be necessary due to the volatility of loss reserves on these run off lines 
run off lines typically have increased volatility as paid claim trends often emerge differently than those that have been historically indicated  thus increasing the uncertainty inherent in reserve estimates  especially on longer tailed lines such as workers compensation 
if we are unable to timely and effectively convert data from our new mexico policy administration information system to the same system as used for the underwriting and claims function in our other locations  underwriting and claim controls related to our new mexico operations may continue to operate ineffectively 
as a result  errors or inaccuracies in our processing and recording of premiums  paid losses and loss adjustment expenses and case reserves may not be detected on a timely basis 
although we are taking steps to remediate these control deficiencies  there can be no assurance that we will be effective in doing so 
if our remediation efforts are unsuccessful  there will continue to be a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement in our financial statements relating to our new mexico operation will not be detected 
substantial jury awards against our insureds could impose liability on us exceeding our policy limits or the funds we have reserved for the payment of claims 
tort reform is currently being considered in various forms by congress 
if enacted  such reform could preempt state tort reforms currently in effect in the markets in which we do business 
if federal reforms are less favorable than those currently in place in our markets  such reforms could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if the marketplace puts pressure on pricing increases  we may not be able to obtain expected rate increases 
if competitive or other conditions change  our revenues may decrease or our expenses may increase 

table of contents if we experience substantial increases in claims frequency or severity patterns  our profitability may decline 
we may be unable to collect the full amount of reinsurance recoverable from pma capital insurance company and or converium reinsurance na  inc  as well as our other reinsurers  if their cash flow or surplus levels are inadequate to make claim payments  which could result in a future charge to income 
if reinsurance rates rise significantly or reinsurance from creditworthy reinsurers becomes unavailable or reinsurers are unable to pay our claims  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
the concentration of our business in michigan  illinois  ohio and new mexico leaves us vulnerable to various factors specific to those states 
if our current relationship with medical associations and physicians does not continue  our ability to market our products and compete successfully may be harmed 
the passing of tort reform at a national level may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations pertaining to certain markets that currently have tort reform in place at the state level 
an interruption or change in our relationship with scw agency group  an insurance sales agency that is principally owned by our former president and ceo  could reduce our insurance premiums and net income 
this agency accounts for substantially more of our medical professional liability premiums written than any other agency 
if any of the member companies in the various guaranty associations in which we participate were to become insolvent  we could be assessed by the relevant association in an amount that could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations 
we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for rate increases  which may negatively affect our profitability 
if we fail to comply with insurance industry regulations  or if those regulations become more burdensome to us  we may not be able to operate profitably 
a reduction in our am best company rating could make it more difficult for us to sell our products 
changes in prevailing interest rates and other negative changes in financial market conditions may reduce our revenues  cash flows or assets  including the amount of unrealized gains on investments shown on our balance sheet 
an increase in short term interest rates will increase our debt service costs related to our variable rate long term debt 
changes in current market conditions may adversely impact the property value of real estate investments that we currently hold 
a downturn in general economic conditions or significant increase in inflation in the markets in which we compete could negatively affect our profitability 
other factors not currently anticipated by management may also materially and adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations

table of contents overview of apcapital s operations we are a leading provider of medical professional liability insurance coverage  writing this coverage in states throughout the country  although we focus on the upper midwest and new mexico 
this insurance coverage protects physicians and other health providers from claims filed against them for alleged acts of medical malpractice 
medical professional liability insurance represented of our direct premiums written in in the fourth quarter of  the company began to implement plans to exit our other lines of insurance  workers compensation and health 
we began non renewing these other insurance policies in in late and early  we received downgrades in our financial strength rating from am best 
these downgrades  and their potential impact on our business  are discussed more fully in item business am best company rating  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
the economics of property casualty insurance as a property and casualty insurer  our results of operations are primarily driven by our underwriting results  which are measured by subtracting incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses from net premiums earned 
while this measure is a key performance indicator of an insurance company s operations  it is not uncommon for a property and casualty insurance company to generate an underwriting loss  yet earn a profit overall  because of the availability of investment income to offset the underwriting loss 
an insurance company earns investment income on what is commonly referred to as the float 
the float is money that we hold  in the form of investments  from premiums that we have collected 
although most of these premiums will ultimately be used to make claim payments and to pay for claims adjustment expenses  the period of time that we hold the float prior to paying losses can extend over several years 
the key factors that determine the amount of investment income we are able to generate are the rate of return  or yield  on the float  and the amount of time we are able to hold the float 
most of the insurance policies we write have a one year policy term 
the written premiums associated with policies we write are earned ratably over the year in which we provide insurance coverage 
this means that rate increases that we implement will not be fully earned for up to months as policyholders who renewed immediately prior to the rate increase will not be charged the higher rate for up to months  and then those premiums will take another months to be fully earned 
our loss experience is a major component of our results of operations 
when we receive notice of a claim that is covered under a policy we have issued  our claims adjusters establish a reserve for the expected cost to settle the claim  including estimates of any related legal or other expenses associated with resolving the claim 
these reserves are referred to as case basis reserves 
in addition  at the end of each reporting period  certain losses will have occurred that have not been reported to us 
accordingly  we establish reserves for such incurred but not reported  or ibnr  losses and related loss adjustment expenses 
our incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses represent any payments made to settle losses  including related loss adjustment expense payments  as well as any change in our case basis and ibnr reserves 
paid and incurred losses give different pictures of our loss experience  and examining both can help provide a better understanding of our losses 
paid losses are the cash payments we make in a given year  irrespective of the year in which the claim giving rise to the payment occurred or was reported 
most payments made in a given year are for claims that were reported in previous years because of the extended amount of time required to resolve a claim through litigation or settlement 
incurred losses in any given year reflect our expectations of the amount that will ultimately be paid on claims reported in that year 
incurred losses in a single year  will also reflect any adjustment we make to the expected amounts that must be paid on claims reported during previous years  as well as any changes in our estimates for ibnr 
underwriting expenses represent costs associated with issuing new and renewal business as well as ongoing policy maintenance expenses 
some of these costs  such as commissions and premium taxes  as well as a portion of the salaries related to our underwriting staff  vary with and are primarily related to the production of new and renewal business 
these costs are deferred and amortized over the related period in 
table of contents which we earn the premiums associated with the business written 
other costs that do not vary with the production of new and renewal business are charged to income as incurred 
to ensure the security of our policyholders  we must maintain assets in excess of total liabilities 
this excess  or surplus  is the principal measure used by state insurance regulators  and rating agencies such as am best  to evaluate the company s financial strength 
medical professional liability insurers generally attempt to keep this surplus level approximately equal to their annual net premiums written 
the medical professional liability insurance market the medical professional liability insurance business  like all other property and casualty insurance markets  tends to cycle through what are often referred to as hard and soft markets 
a hard market is generally characterized as a period of rapidly rising premium rates  tightened underwriting standards  narrowed coverage  and the withdrawal of insurers from certain markets 
soft markets  are usually characterized by relatively flat or slow rising premium rates  less stringent underwriting standards  expanded coverage and strong competition among insurers 
in the mid to late s  the medical professional liability insurance industry was generally viewed as being in a soft market 
however  since approximately  the trend in medical professional liability insurance has been towards a harder market 
hard and soft market cycles tend to be more extreme in the medical professional liability business than in other insurance businesses because of the longer period of time required to resolve medical malpractice claims 
the rising cost of medical professional liability insurance has been prominent in the media in recent years 
several factors have contributed to the recent premium rate increases such as an increase in paid losses  decreased investment income due to lower prevailing interest rates  reduced competition and increased reinsurance rates 
the most significant factor contributing to the increase in medical professional liability premiums in recent years is the increase in average paid loss severity 
to combat rising loss costs  we have initiated several actions including exited unprofitable markets such as florida and nevada  ceased writing occurrence based policies in all markets with the exception of michigan  indiana and new mexico  discontinued writing certain high risk specialties  implemented on site risk management assessments on all new business in ohio  kentucky and illinois  implemented a unique communication skills assessment in targeted markets  and reduced policy limits 
tort reform is another factor that affects our business 
tort reform encompasses a variety of subject matters  however  the one most critical to the medical professional liability insurance market is limits on non economic damages and punitive damages 
historically  tort reform has occurred on a state by state basis 
accordingly  losses can vary dramatically by state depending on the level of tort reform the state has enacted 
we monitor state tort reform closely and evaluate any changes for impacts on our current business strategies and estimated loss reserves 
tort reform is currently being considered in various forms by congress 
if enacted  such reform could preempt state tort reforms currently in effect in the markets in which we do business 
if federal reforms are less favorable than those currently in place in our markets  such reforms could have a material adverse effect on our business 
anticipated losses will generally be the primary determinant of premium rates 
we establish medical professional liability premium base rates for particular medical specialties within a given state and sometimes for a specific geographic region within a state 
we also offer discounts or add surcharges for particular policyholder characteristics  such as claims history or participation in any risk management programs 
our premium rates are based on anticipated losses on claims and related expenses  expected investment income  
table of contents our surplus needs  and the desire to earn a reasonable profit for shareholders 
in most states  however  insurance regulators have the authority to approve or deny proposed premium rate changes 
medical professional liability insurance can be written on both a claims made and an occurrence basis 
claims made policies  which are the most common  cover claims reported during the year in which the policy is in effect 
occurrence based policies cover claims arising out of events that have occurred during the year in which the policy was in effect  regardless of when they are reported 
during the last three years  approximately of our medical professional liability direct premiums represented claims made policies  with the remainder representing occurrence based policies 
although we have discontinued writing occurrence based policies in certain states and markets  we have not seen an overall decrease in occurrence based premiums as a result of premium rate increases in new mexico  where we are required to write occurrence based policies by law  and in other states such as michigan 
accurately predicting losses on medical professional liability claims is difficult for several reasons 
first  most medical professional liability claims take several years to resolve 
this often lengthy resolution period reflects the time needed for the discovery of the medical malpractice  which is often not reported to the insured immediately  the filing of a claim  determining  through settlement or trial  the payment responsibilities  if any  associated with the claim  and the payment of the claim 
as a result  we often must estimate the ultimate cost to settle a claim  including related expenses  several years in advance of payment 
second  the range of the ultimate potential loss can vary significantly for individual claims with similar characteristics  making it difficult to predict the ultimate loss associated with any single claim 
third  the ultimate projected loss is based  in part  on actuarial methodologies using relevant historical data  which in some cases may be limited 
we review our estimates quarterly  and as facts and patterns emerge that provide us with more relevant information related to projection of ultimate expected loss costs  we adjust our estimates related to the liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses  with the change in estimates resulting in either an increase or decrease in incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses for the current period 
as with other types of property and casualty insurance  medical professional liability insurance policies are subject to policy limits 
the limits of liability purchased by our medical professional liability policyholders differ by state 
in michigan and new mexico  the most common limits purchased are  of coverage per claim and  of aggregate coverage per year 
in all other states in which we write business  the most common policy limits purchased are million million  and we write no policies with limits in excess of million million 
important agency relationship the principal agency through which we write medical professional liability insurance is scw agency group  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries  collectively referred to as scw 
scw is principally owned by william b 
cheeseman  our former president and chief executive officer and director 
mr 
cheeseman received no cash or other compensation  dividends or other distribution from scw while he was employed by the company 
his only benefit from his ownership interest in scw while he was an employee of the company was the potential appreciation of his investment in scw 
if scw increases the amount of business it writes for us  scw will earn more commission revenue from us 
to the extent the increase in commission revenue we pay scw increases scw s profits  mr 
cheeseman s ownership interest may appreciate 
following his retirement from apcapital on december   mr 
cheeseman took a more active role in scw as an employee of that company 
mr 
cheeseman ceased to be a director of apcapital following its annual meeting of shareholders 
scw has been a significant agent for us for many years 
the commission rates we have paid to scw have been either the same or less than the commission rates we paid to our other agents 
in addition  with limited exceptions  the only medical professional liability insurance sold by scw in michigan was written by the company 
we are not required to sell insurance solely through scw 
we believe these factors have created a more favorable agency relationship for us than we have with our other agents 
commissions scw receives on premiums it writes for apcapital s insurance subsidiaries typically account for to of its revenues 
direct premiums written for us by scw during  and 
table of contents totaled   and  respectively  representing   and of the company s direct premiums written during such years 
commission expense we incurred related to scw approximated   and  in  and  respectively 
based on financial information made available to us  we estimate scw s net profits on the commission revenue earned from us in to be approximately million 
we have not attempted to independently audit or verify the information scw has furnished  although we have no reason to believe it is inaccurate 
for purposes of this disclosure  we have estimated the net profits that scw earned on the revenue received from us by calculating the profit percentage that scw s net profits bears to its total revenue in and applying that percentage to the revenue earned from us 
prior to mr 
cheeseman s retirement  there were various safeguards to protect the company from actual or potential conflicts of interest arising from this relationship 
mr 
cheeseman was prohibited from acting as a director  officer or employee of scw and  pursuant to company policy  did not participate in day to day discussions between the company and scw or in decisions about whether to underwrite business proposed to be written by scw prior to his retirement 
moreover  we applied and continue to apply the same underwriting rating rules to business written by scw as we apply to business written by other agencies 
these underwriting rating rules are generally filed with the regulatory agencies in the various states in which we do business and are established solely by the company in order to control the quality of business submitted by all agents  including scw 
we also monitor our loss experience on the business written by our agents  including scw 
in january  we completed a new year contract with scw 
the agreement provides for american physicians to continue to be the exclusive medical professional liability carrier scw represents in the state of michigan  subject to limited exceptions  such as a downgrade of our am best rating 
however  we continue to have the right to appoint other agents 
scw may continue to represent other insurance companies in states other than michigan 
the contract provides for scw to be paid commissions consistent with the marketplace 
the terms of the new agency agreement were determined by negotiations between our management staff and scw s management  and under the review of independent consultants  and ultimately approved by our board of directors 
in rendering its approval  the board of directors considered the fairness of the agreed rates and determined that they were fair to the company based on an evaluation of market rates and agreements between the company and its other agents  among other considerations 
significant accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis based on historical developments  market conditions  industry trends and other information we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions  and that reported results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by the need to make accounting adjustments to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions from time to time 
adjustments related to changes in estimates are reflected in the company s earnings in the period those estimates changed 
the following policies are those we believe to be the most sensitive to estimates and judgments 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
such information is incorporated herein by reference 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses our consolidated financial statements include estimated reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses related to our various insurance lines of business 
we have a team of actuaries on our staff that analyzes and develops projections of ultimate payments that will be made to settle all losses incurred as of each balance sheet date  and the related loss adjustment expenses 
our actuaries utilize standard actuarial techniques to project ultimate losses based on our paid and incurred loss information and claim count  as well as industry data 
these projections are done using the company s data  including the number of claims reported and paid  and the average severity of reported and paid claims  as well as industry data 
this process 
table of contents assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
a key projection used in the actuarial estimation of ultimate losses takes an average payment severity times a projected total number of claims frequency 
accordingly  any changes in the frequency or severity of claims reported to us can have a significant impact on actuarial estimates of ultimate losses and recorded reserves 
based on these quantitative as well as other qualitative factors  such as a review of current pricing and underwriting initiatives  an evaluation of reinsurance costs and retention levels  and the current reserving practices of the company s claims department  we select a best estimate of ultimate future losses  and then record this best estimate in the company s consolidated financial statements 
as required by insurance regulatory authorities  we receive an annual statement of opinion by an independent consulting actuary concerning the adequacy of our reserves 
when a claim is reported to us  claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
this estimate reflects an informed judgment based upon insurance reserving practices appropriate for the relevant line of business  and on the experience and knowledge of the estimator regarding the nature and value of the specific claim  the severity of injury or damage  and the policy provisions relating to the type of loss 
case reserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary by the claims staff as more information becomes available 
reserves for claims incurred but not reported provide for the future reporting of claims already incurred  and development on claims already reported 
the reserve for claims incurred but not reported is determined based on historical loss trends 
it often takes several years for medical professional liability claims to be resolved  three to six years on average from the time the loss is reported 
as a result  the ultimate payment can be difficult to project due to changes in legal and other economic environmental factors during the intervening period 
in addition  changes in the company s current case reserving philosophy can introduce additional uncertainty into the actuarial estimation process  as a strengthening of case reserves results in higher reported losses  which increases the average severity of claims used in actuarial projections 
therefore  careful consideration must be made when evaluating the strengthening of case reserves to ensure that the impact on ultimate projected losses is not under or overstated 
the process of estimating the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses involves significant judgment and is complex and imprecise due to the number of variables and assumptions inherent in the estimation process 
these variables include the effects on ultimate loss payments of internal factors such as changes in claims handling practices and changes in the mix of our products  as well as external factors such as changes in loss severity trends  economic inflation  judicial trends and legislative and regulatory changes 
in addition  medical professional liability claims may take several years to resolve due to typical delays in reporting claims to us  the often lengthy discovery process  and the time necessary to defend the claim 
in addition  claims with similar characteristics may result in very different ultimate losses depending on the state or region where the claim occurred 
all of these factors contribute to the variability in estimating ultimate loss payments  especially since the affects of many of these variables cannot be directly quantified  particularly on a prospective basis 
although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  we believe that the reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is adequate 
however  there can be no assurance that losses will not exceed the reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  as future trends related to the frequency and severity of claims  and other factors  may develop differently than management has projected 
the assumptions and methodologies used in estimating and establishing the reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are continually reviewed and any adjustments are reflected as income or expense in the period in which the adjustment is made 
historically  such adjustments have not exceeded of our recorded net reserves as of the beginning of the period  but can materially and adversely affect our results of operations when an adjustment is made 
due to the current volatility of losses in the medical professional liability industry  adjustments have occurred in each of the last several years 
with the exception of reserves for extended reporting period claims discussed below  we do not discount our reserves to recognize the time value of money 

table of contents investments investments represent our largest asset and are the primary source of funds to pay insurance claims 
all of our fixed maturity securities are classified as available for sale  which are those securities that would be available to be sold in the future in response to our liquidity needs  changes in market interest rates and asset liability management strategies 
available for sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income  net of deferred taxes 
investment income includes amortization of premium and accrual of discount on the yield to maturity method relating to investments acquired at other than par value 
in late  we started the liquidation of our equity securities portfolio 
at december   we had approximately million of non affiliated private placement equity securities remaining in our portfolio 
these equity securities were carried at market value  as determined by management  with the assistance of the company s third party equity investment manager 
this market value is an approximation of the net realizable value of the equity securities in light of management s intent to sell the securities in the fair value of fixed maturity securities is based on market quotations provided to us by our third party custodian who engages independent third party pricing sources that use valuation models 
the valuation models used by the independent third party pricing sources use indicative information such as ratings  industry  coupon  and maturity along with publicly traded bond prices to determine security specific spreads  and the ultimate fair value of the non publicly traded fixed maturity securities 
real estate is carried at the lesser of historical cost  less accumulated depreciation or estimated fair value as determined by recent appraisals  offers from prospective independent third party buyers  or the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the property 
realized gains or losses on sales or maturities of investments are determined on a specific identification basis and are credited or charged to income 
we periodically review our investment portfolio for any potential credit quality or collection issues and for any securities with respect to which we consider any decline in market value to be other than temporary 
investments which are considered to be other than temporarily impaired  or otti  are written down to their estimated net realizable value as of the end of the period in which the otti was noted 
subsequent recoveries in the fair value of impaired securities are not reported in income  but rather as unrealized gains  net of tax  in comprehensive income 
inherent in our evaluation of a particular security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer  and its future liquidity and earnings potential 
some of the factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in market value is other than temporary are our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value  the recoverability of principal and interest related to the security  the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost for equity securities  or amortized cost for fixed maturity securities  the financial condition  near term and long term earnings and cash flow prospects of the issuer  including relevant industry conditions and trends  and implications of rating agency actions  and the specific reasons that a security is in a significant unrealized loss position  including market conditions that could affect access to liquidity 
the following table shows the aging of unrealized losses included in our investment portfolio as of december  security type months in thousands fixed maturity total 
table of contents during the year ended december   we recorded losses of  related to various stocks whose decline was deemed to be other than temporary based on their anticipated liquidation  as well as  impairment losses on real estate 
during  we sold investment real estate for which  of impairment losses had previously been recorded 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million on enhanced equipment trust certificates that were issued by delta airlines 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of  related to bonds issued by frontier corporation  a subsidiary of global crossings 
these bonds were converted into global crossings common stock in december  and sold by us in during we recorded gross realized losses on the sale of investment securities and investment real estate of approximately million 
approximately million of this loss was realized on the sale of investment real estate 
as a result of our desire to divest our real estate holdings  and thereby reduce our risk related to fluctuations in the real estate market  we were willing to accept a lower offer on the properties  which ultimately resulted in the recorded loss 
the remaining loss of approximately million relates to fixed maturity securities  million  and equity securities  million 
the realized loss on our equity securities was primarily the result of the unusually high turnover in our equity portfolio during  which resulted in numerous sales that generated small dollar losses 
the losses on our fixed maturity portfolio were primarily related to certain securities that we held  which had a rate of interest that was inversely related to the london interbank offered rate 
these securities were maintained as part of our overall interest rate risk management program in the event that interest rates began to decline 
however  interest rates have risen since we acquired the securities  and they were no longer deemed necessary 
in light of the rise in interest rates  the market value of the bonds had declined  which resulted in the loss upon the sale 
in addition to the divestiture of investment real estate properties  we also made other changes in our investment portfolio during with the intent of reducing our exposure to credit and interest rate risk 
these changes included liquidating our high yield bond portfolio and other non investment grade fixed maturity securities  as well as the start of the liquidation of our equity portfolio in the fourth quarter of for further information regarding our investments  including the maturity distribution of fixed maturity securities and unrealized holding gains and losses  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

reserve for extended reporting period claims a portion of the coverage that physicians purchase under claims made policies is for an additional death  disability and retirement ddr insurance benefit 
this ddr coverage provides coverage to the physician for any prior incidents occurring during the coverage period that are reported after their death  disability or retirement 
the loss exposure associated with this product is known as extended reporting period claims 
the reserve for extended reporting period claims coverage is recorded during the term of the original claims made policy  based on the present value of future estimated benefits  including morbidity and mortality assumptions  less the present value of expected future premiums associated with this ddr coverage 
the reserves for these claims fluctuate based on the number of physicians who are eligible for this coverage and their age 
any changes in the ddr reserves are reflected as an expense in the period in which we become aware that an adjustment is necessary 
at december  and  our recorded ddr reserves were million  which includes a discount related to the present value calculation of approximately million 
reinsurance in accordance with industry practice  we cede to other insurance companies some of the potential liability under insurance policies we have underwritten 
this practice  called reinsurance  helps us reduce our net liability on individual risks  stabilize our underwriting results and increase our underwriting capacity 
as payment for sharing a portion of our risk  we are also required to share a part of the premium we receive on the related policies 
we determine the amount and scope of reinsurance coverage to purchase each year based upon an evaluation of the risks accepted  consultations with reinsurance brokers and a review of market 
table of contents conditions  including the availability and pricing of reinsurance 
our reinsurance arrangements are generally renegotiated annually 
reinsurance premiums and losses related to reinsured business are accounted for on bases consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts 
premiums ceded to other companies are reported as a reduction of premium income 
reinsured losses incurred are reported as a reduction of gross losses incurred 
under our primary professional liability reinsurance contract  the portion of the policyholder premium ceded to the reinsurers is swing rated  or experience rated on a retrospective basis 
this swing rated contract is subject to a minimum and maximum premium range to be paid to the reinsurers in the future  depending upon the extent of losses actually paid by the reinsurers 
we pay a provisional premium during the initial policy year 
a liability is recorded to represent an estimate of net additional payments to be made to the reinsurers under the program  based on the level of loss and lae reserves recorded 
to the extent that our estimate for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses changes  the amount of swing rated reinsurance premiums may also change 
we annually review the financial stability of all of our reinsurers 
this review includes a ratings analysis of each reinsurer participating in a reinsurance contract 
at december   we have not recorded an allowance for any potentially uncollectible amounts 
however  we are closely monitoring the cash flows and financial condition of pma capital insurance company and converium reinsurance na  inc in light of announcements made by those companies during at december   we had reinsurance recoverables  including pre paid reinsurance premiums  from pma capital and converium of approximately million and million  respectively 
in may  we commuted our ceded reinsurance treaties with gerling 
we recognized the million received from gerling as reduction of losses and loss adjustment expenses paid thereby reducing losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the current year 
we also eliminated our reinsurance recoverable from gerling thereby increasing losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to recognize the effect of releasing gerling from its obligations under the treaties 
the net effect of the commutation was an increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses of million  partially offset by an  increase in net premiums earned 
income taxes deferred federal income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to the differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities  and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets are recorded for differences that create deductible temporary differences and loss and credit carryforwards  and deferred tax liabilities are recorded for differences that create taxable temporary differences 
deductible temporary differences occur when the recognition of an expense for tax purposes is deferred or revenue accelerated 
taxable temporary differences represent expenses that have been accelerated for tax purposes or revenues that have been deferred 
future realization of the tax benefit of an existing deductible temporary differences or carryforwards ultimately depends on the availability of sufficient taxable income within the appropriate period 
the relevant accounting guidance identifies four sources of taxable income that may be available to realize the tax benefit of deductible temporary differences and carryforwards future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences ie  deferred tax liabilities  taxable income available in available carryback years  tax planning strategies  and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
in making our assessment of the future realization of deferred tax assets  we considered all of the above sources of future taxable income 
our taxable losses in  and mean that there is no taxable income available in the carryback years 
we do not currently have any viable tax planning strategies 
however  
table of contents unrealized gains related to our investment portfolio and other taxable temporary differences do create a source of future taxable income that we have considered in our realization assessment 
future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary difference and carryforwards is the most subjective of the available sources of taxable income as it is based on future earnings projections 
these subjective projections of future taxable income must be weighed against the objective evidence of our recent history of losses 
the net income that we reported in is a positive factor indicating the availability of future taxable income  however  we do not believe that it is sufficient to overcome the negative evidence presented by our losses in  or accordingly  at december   we maintained a valuation allowance 
we will continue to weigh the evidence concerning the availability of future taxable income as of the end of each quarter 
if we continue to report net income in  we believe that there is a strong likelihood that the weight of the positive evidence concerning the availability of future taxable income will exceed the negative evidence presented by our losses in  and  and that the valuation allowance may be reduced or eliminated in the period when such a conclusion is reached 
with the exception of the initial recognition  by the reduction or elimination of the valuation allowance  of certain tax benefits that are credited or charged directly to accumulated other comprehensive income or other shareholders equity accounts  the reduction or the elimination of the valuation allowance will be reported in the period of reversal as a federal income tax benefit and included in net income  which will have a positive impact on our effective tax rate 
changes in the valuation allowance during were allocated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements to federal income taxes a component of net income  other comprehensive income  or other components of shareholders equity  depending on the nature of the deferred item that gave rise to the change 
the establishment of the valuation allowance in was all recorded as federal income tax expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income  included elsewhere in this report 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the deferred tax valuation allowance and its impact on our financial condition and results of operations

deferred policy acquisition costs deferred policy acquisition costs  or dac  are those costs that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new  or renewal  business and include such costs as commissions  premium taxes and other costs incurred in connection with writing business 
these costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
under gaap  the premiums that will be earned in future periods  to which these deferred costs relate  must produce sufficient profits to offset the future expense that will be recognized from the amortization of the dac  that is  the dac must be recoverable 
in evaluating the recoverability of dac  we have made certain assumptions regarding future costs associated with the business written  such as costs to maintain the policies and the ultimate projected loss and loss adjustment expense payments associated with these policies 
in addition  we have considered future investment income in determining the recoverability of dac  which requires certain assumptions regarding the timing of payments of future loss and loss adjustment expenses  as well as the yield on our investment portfolio 
based on our analysis as of december   the dac carried on the consolidated balance sheets  included elsewhere in this report  of million  was deemed to be fully recoverable 
however  during  we wrote off approximately  of dac associated with our other insurance lines as it was deemed to not be recoverable 
while we believe that our assumptions and estimates related to the recoverability of dac are reasonable  historically  our accident year loss ratios have developed unfavorably 
in the event that future unfavorable adjustments to loss reserves occur  the likelihood of our being able to recover these deferred costs will diminish  and the possibility of a write off of a portion or all of our dac in future periods will increase 

table of contents description of ratios analyzed in the analysis of our operating results that follows  we refer to various financial ratios that management uses to analyze and compare the underwriting results of our insurance operations 
these ratios are calculated on a gaap basis and include loss ratio this ratio compares our losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred  net of reinsurance  to our net premiums earned  and indicates how much we expect to pay policyholders for claims and related settlement expenses compared to the amount of premiums we earn 
the calendar year loss ratio uses all losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the current calendar year ie  related to all accident years 
the accident year loss ratio uses only those loss and loss adjustment expenses that relate to the current accident year ie  excludes the effect of development on prior year loss reserves 
the lower the percentage  the more profitable our insurance business is  all other things being equal 
underwriting expense ratio this ratio compares our expenses to obtain new business and renew existing business  plus normal operating expenses  to our net premiums earned 
the ratio is used to measure how efficient we are at obtaining business and operating the insurance segments 
the lower the percentage  the more efficient we are  all else being equal 
sometimes  however  a higher underwriting expense ratio can result in better business as more rigorous risk management and underwriting procedures may result in the non renewal of higher risk accounts  which can in turn improve our loss ratio  and overall profitability 
combined ratio this ratio equals the sum of our loss ratio and underwriting expense ratio 
the lower the percentage  the more profitable our insurance business is 
this ratio excludes the effects of investment income 
the statutory ratios will differ from gaap ratios as a result of differences in accounting between the statutory basis of accounting and gaap 
additionally  the denominator for the underwriting expense ratio for gaap is net premiums earned  compared to net premiums written for the statutory underwriting expense ratio

partially offsetting these positive factors were increases in the underwriting losses of the other insurance lines segment  which were primarily attributable to the run off of the workers compensation and health lines of insurance  and increases in general and administrative expenses 
the net loss reported in was the result of the unfavorable development on 
table of contents prior year loss reserves  primarily related to our medical professional liability segment  and an increase in paid loss severity noted during the third quarter  particularly in our florida  ohio and kentucky markets 
we also established the deferred tax valuation allowance of million in the third quarter of  as we determined at that time there was not adequate support regarding the availability of future taxable income based on our recent loss history 
once the company has re established a pattern of profitability  the deferred tax asset valuation allowance may be reduced  or eliminated  based on the availability of future taxable income  which will create a federal income tax benefit in the period of reversal 
net premiums earned decreased during  as compared to  primarily as a result of our exit from the other insurance lines of business  which we announced in the fourth quarter of these decreases were partially offset by the effect of premium rate increases in our medical professional liability line of business and an  increase in net premiums earned related to the commutation of our reinsurance treaties with gerling 
we anticipate that net premiums earned will continue to remain at lower levels than in previous years for the near future as we complete our exit from the other insurance lines 
however  we believe that rate increases related to our medical professional liability line will eventually offset the decrease in net premiums earned from the exit of these lines 
the increase in investment income was the result of strong returns on our collateralized mortgage obligations and high yield bond portfolios during the first part of the year  one time call premiums of million and a decrease in the percentage of our investment portfolio allocated to short term investments 
the yield on our investment portfolio was for compared to for during  we liquidated our million high yield bond investment portfolio for a pre tax gain of million 
in addition  we liquidated the majority of our other non investment grade securities for a pre tax gain of million 
the liquidation of our high yield bonds and other non investment grade securities has reduced the overall risk level associated with our investment portfolio  but is likely to decrease future investment income as we reinvest in lower risk  lower yielding securities 
offsetting the above mentioned gains was a million charge for the write off of capitalized software costs associated with an information system project involving a computer system to administer medical professional liability policies and claims and a pre tax realized loss on the sale of investment real estate of million 
the information system project  which began in the fall of  was not producing the anticipated results and management decided to discontinue the project 
in addition  we recorded a  impairment charge related to other investment real estate properties 
incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses were million in  a decrease of million compared to this decrease was the result of the million of unfavorable development on prior year loss reserves recorded in prior year unfavorable loss reserve development in was million  which consists of unfavorable development related to the other insurance line of business  and a million increase in incurred losses from the commutation of our reinsurance treaties with gerling in  partially offset by favorable development on the medical professional liability line of business 
the gerling commutation is more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

our incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses are analyzed more fully in the discussions of our individual operating segment results 
underwriting expenses were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from this decrease was the result of our lower premium volume  which lowered the corresponding commission and premium tax expense 
in addition  we downsized the non operational support staff in our home office during the first half of in total  we eliminated approximately positions with severances totaling approximately million during the year ended december  these positions represent annual salary and employee benefit costs of approximately million 
investment expenses were million for the year ended december   a decrease of  from the same period of this decrease is primarily related to the liquidation of our high yield portfolio during the first half of and the sale of some of our investment real estate

general and administrative expenses increased million during  primarily due to increased legal  audit and other professional fees incurred as a result of actions taken to comply with the sarbanes oxley act and related sec requirements and the exploration of strategic alternatives by the board of directors 
we anticipate general and administrative expenses to decrease in to levels below those incurred in  but not as low as previously experienced in prior years as the company will continue to incur costs associated with ongoing sarbanes oxley compliance 
other expenses for consist of contract termination costs incurred in connection with the sub lease of approximately  square feet of office space in chicago 
during  we incurred restructuring expenses related to employee separation costs as a result of terminations in connection with our exit from the other insurance segment 
as we continue our exit from our other insurance lines in and beyond  we anticipate incurring approximately  of additional employee separation costs in future periods 
the decrease in federal income tax expense in was the result of the establishment of the deferred tax valuation allowance in once we have re established a pattern of profitability  and can demonstrate the availability of future taxable income  the deferred tax valuation allowance may be reduced  which will create a federal income tax benefit in the period of reduction 
compared to the net loss reported for was primarily attributable to unfavorable development on prior year loss reserves of million and the establishment of a deferred tax valuation allowance of million 
the unfavorable development on prior year loss reserves was primarily related to our medical professional liability segment  and was the result of an increase in paid loss severity noted during the third quarter  particularly in our florida  ohio and kentucky markets 
we also established the deferred tax valuation allowance in the third quarter of our net loss in was primarily the result of a million underwriting loss  and a million charge  net of tax  for the write off of goodwill  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  partially offset by million of investment income 
net premiums earned decreased during  as compared to  primarily as a result of the restructuring of our workers compensation book of business that began in in the fourth quarter of  we announced our intention to exit the workers compensation and health insurance lines of business 
the yield on our investment portfolio was for compared to for the lower yield in was the result of a general decline in interest rates combined with a higher cash balance during the first part of the year  which produces a significantly lower yield than longer term more productive assets 
we delayed investing a portion of the cash flow generated during the first half of due to the very low interest rate environment and our reluctance to lock in longer term interest rates at prevailing levels

this was partially offset by our reduced exposure in the florida market  the discontinuance of ohio and kentucky occurrence based policies and reduced policies in force in illinois 
our physician policy count at december  has decreased approximately from december  this decline was the result of increased price competition in selected markets and strict underwriting standards

table of contents december   an increase of 
although we began our exit from the florida market in december and our premiums written in that state have declined significantly  we continue to have direct premiums written in that state as a result of installment premiums on extended reporting coverage  which we were required by florida state law to offer insureds as we non renewed their policies 
the premiums for these policies may be paid in annual installments  not to exceed three years 
accordingly  with the exception of premiums related to pic  we should not have any premium writings in florida after direct premiums written by pic in the state of florida increased million during to million compared to our investment in  and consolidation of pic is more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
such information is incorporated herein by reference we believe that the current pricing environment for medical professional liability insurance is favorable 
we expect medical professional liability direct premiums written to increase moderately in the future as the company is granted additional rate increases by regulatory authorities 
however  we anticipate that rate increases in may not be as significant as those granted in prior years 
our net premiums written and earned during increased a greater percentage than direct premiums written as effective january  we began retaining a participation in our primary excess of loss reinsurance layer 
this increase in net written premiums also resulted in the larger percentage increase in net earned premiums 
effective january   we will only have one excess of loss reinsurance treaty

the loss ratio  on an accident year basis  was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the accident year loss ratio was primarily the result of rate increases in all markets  exiting florida and certain occurrence based markets and stricter underwriting standards  the increase in underwriting expenses is attributable to the higher direct written premiums  the payment of severance costs relating to a reduction in headcount  and an increase in professional service costs relating to our initial internal controls audit required by the sarbanes oxley act and related sec rules 
compared to direct premiums written for the medical professional liability segment increased in primarily as a result of rate increases in virtually all markets  partially offset by our non renewal of policies in our florida market

net premiums earned  however  did not decrease as much as direct and net premiums written  as premiums associated with workers compensation policies written in continue to be earned in at december   approximately million of net unearned premium related to the workers compensation line of insurance remained 
however  approximately million of this net unearned premium relates to involuntary reinsurance that we are required to assume in many states 
this assumed reinsurance is based primarily on the amount of direct premium we write in a given state 
accordingly  we anticipate that we will 
table of contents see this assumed reinsurance decrease dramatically in  which should reduce both our premium revenues and incurred losses 
incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses decreased primarily as a result of the decrease in exposure associated with the reduced number of covered lives in our health line  and the number of policies in force for workers compensation 
prior year reserves developed unfavorably during the year by million  primarily those relating to the workers compensation business 
the unfavorable development on prior accident year reserves is primarily the result of increasing reserve estimates due to an increasing paid severity trend 
in addition  with the centralization of remaining workers compensation claims processing in our louisville  kentucky office  and in an effort to expedite the run off process  we have reviewed a substantial portion of all outstanding claim files and are attempting to settle claims as quickly as possible 
at december  and  we had  and  respectively  open workers compensation claims 
this increased effort has resulted in higher reported losses than those originally projected in the december  reserve estimates 
as we continue the run off of other insurance claims  loss reserves will continue to be volatile and additional adverse development on prior year losses may occur 
the decrease in underwriting expenses is primarily the result of reduced salary and employee benefit costs as a result of the departure of the other insurance management team in the last nine months of also  as a result of the decreased premium volume  there was a decrease in corporate and shared services salary  employee benefit and other costs allocated to the other insurance lines segment 
as we continue our exit from these lines  these underwriting expenses should continue to decrease 
compared to other insurance lines direct premiums written decreased during as a result of the restructuring of the books of business initiated in and the subsequent decision to exit these lines completely in net premiums earned did not decrease as much as direct premiums written as we continued to earn in the premiums that were written in the restructuring of the books of business  combined with rate increases and improved claims management  have translated into lower loss and loss adjustment expenses and lower calendar year and accident year loss ratios 
the decrease in underwriting expenses was primarily the result of the decrease in premiums written

the increase in these expenses was partially offset by an increase in other income

apcapital s ongoing cash flow will consist primarily of dividends and other permissible payments from its subsidiaries and investment earnings on funds held 
the payment of dividends to apcapital by its insurance subsidiaries is subject to limitations imposed by applicable law 
apcapital s primary uses of cash  on both a short and long term bases include periodic interest payments  operating expenses  and the repayment of the debentures 
in january  apcapital made a million cash surplus contribution to american physicians to increase its statutory capital and surplus 
in december  american physicians  paid an million dividend to apcapital to ensure that the holding company had cash to service debt costs and other operating expenses 
in addition  this allowed apcapital the ability to make a surplus contribution of million to insurance corporation of america  to meet regulatory requirements concerning adequate surplus levels 
apcapital also received a dividend of  from its subsidiary apindemnity in december after the dividends and contribution  apcapital s cash and cash equivalent resources totaled approximately million  which will be held at apcapital for future debt service costs

we repurchased  and  shares  at a cost of million and million  during and  respectively  bringing the total number of shares purchased pursuant to these plans to  at a total cost of  or an average price per share of 
our repurchase of shares is subject to limitations that may be imposed by applicable laws and regulations and the rules of the nasdaq stock market 
the timing of the purchases and the number of shares to be bought at any one time depend on market conditions and the company s capital requirements 
as of december   there are approximately  shares of the september  stock repurchase program remaining to be purchased 
we continually evaluate the benefits of repurchasing our shares 
our net cash flow generated by operations was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to million provided by operations for the cash generated by operations in was primarily the result of premiums collected  net of reinsurance premiums paid  of approximately million  which exceeded losses paid of approximately million 
premiums collected in excess of losses paid in were approximately million 
in general  our investment income 
table of contents offsets cash paid for underwriting and general and administrative expenses 
a large portion of our investment expense is related to depreciation on investment in real estate  which is a non cash charge 
moderate premium rate increases are expected to have a positive impact on our cash flows from operations in at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents available and an investment portfolio of million 
the portfolio includes million of bonds maturing in the next year to meet short term cash flow needs 
on a long term basis  fixed income securities are purchased on a basis intended to provide adequate cash flows from future maturities to meet future policyholder obligations and ongoing cash needs to fund operations 
as of december   our fixed maturity portfolio included million of bonds that mature in the next one to five years and million that mature in the next five to ten years 
in addition  at december   we have million of mortgage backed securities that provide periodic principal repayments 
we currently maintain a relatively short investment posture with million in cash and other cash equivalents 
over the next three to six months  we intend to deploy these cash resources in various other securities  including taxable municiples  investment grade corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the anticipated maturities of our fixed maturity securities

based on historical trends  market conditions and our business plans  we believe that our existing resources and sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our short and long term liquidity needs 
however  economic  market and regulatory conditions may change  and there can be no assurance that our funds will be sufficient to meet these liquidity needs 
financial condition in evaluating our financial condition  two factors are the most critical 
first  the availability of adequate statutory capital and surplus to satisfy state regulators and to support our current am best rating  and second  the adequacy of our reserves for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses 
statutory capital and surplus our statutory capital and surplus  which we refer to collectively as surplus  at december  was approximately million  which results in a net premiums written to surplus ratio of 
statutory surplus at december  was approximately million  for a net premiums written to surplus ratio of the decrease in our ratio of net premiums written to surplus was primarily the result of the exit from the other insurance lines of business in  which resulted in lower premiums written during  as well as our improved medical professional liability underwriting results 
in addition  apcapital contributed million to american physicians in january  american physicians paid a dividend of million to apcapital in december  and apcapital made a surplus contribution to ica for million in december reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses the adequacy of our reserves for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is another critical factor in evaluating our financial condition 
for the year ended december   we recorded an increase in ultimate loss estimates  net of reinsurance of million  or of million of net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as of december  the increase in net ultimate loss estimates reflected revisions in the estimated reserves as a result of actual claims activity in calendar year that differed from projected activity  as well as million of unfavorable development on prior year reserves as a result of the gerling commutation 
specifically  in  a pattern of increasing paid severity emerged on our workers compensation losses  causing an upward revision in the expected future severities on both known and unknown claims 
this increase was offset by favorable development on medical professional liability losses due to lower than expected paid severity  most notably in the ohio and michigan markets 
the gerling commutation is more fully discussed in note of the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which information is herein incorporated by reference 

table of contents the following table shows reported claim counts  open claim counts  the average net case reserve per open claim  and the average claim payment on claims that were closed with a payment for our medical professional liability segment at or for the years ended december   and average net case average paid number number reserve claim per at or for the year ended of reported of open per open claim closed december  claims claims claim with payment due to the long tailed nature of the medical professional liability line of insurance  changes in the actuarially projected ultimate loss severity can have an even greater impact on the balance of recorded reserves than with most other property and casualty insurance lines 
while we believe that our estimate for ultimate projected losses related to our medical professional liability segment is adequate based on our open and reported claim counts  there can be no assurance that additional significant reserve enhancements will not be necessary in the future given the many variables inherent in such estimates and the extended period of time that it can take for claim patterns to emerge 
activity in the liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses by insurance segment for the year ended december  was as follows medical other professional insurance all liability lines segments in thousands balance  december  less  reinsurance recoverables net reserves  december  incurred related to current year gerling global commutation prior years paid related to current year gerling global commutation prior years net reserves  december  plus  reinsurance recoverables balance  december  development as a of december  net reserves also see part i item business loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for a longer term view on the development of our prior year loss reserves  as well as our estimated reserve ranges

table of contents other significant balance sheet items our invested assets consist primarily of fixed maturity and equity securities  which are carried in the consolidated balance sheets  included elsewhere in this report  at their estimated fair value  and investment real estate and investment real estate limited partnerships 
at december   our investment portfolio included net unrealized gains of approximately million  a decrease of million compared to december  net unrealized gains are reported  net of tax  in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets and represented approximately and of consolidated shareholders equity at december  and  respectively 
generally  the estimated fair value of our fixed maturity securities is inversely related to current interest rates 
therefore  as interest rates rise  our net unrealized gains will fall

premiums receivable decreased million  or  to million at december  the decrease is primarily due to our exit from the workers compensation lines of business during reinsurance recoverables decreased  or  to million at december  reinsurance recoverables  on a gaap basis  represent reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses ceded under the various reinsurance treaties we have in place  as well as receivables from reinsurers for loss payments we have made and are entitled to recover under the terms of the treaties 
during  we commuted our reinsurance treaties with gerling resulting in a decrease in reinsurance recoverables of million during nearly offsetting this decrease was an increase related to the higher severity of projected losses related to medical professional liability policies 
property and equipment decreased million  or  to million at december  the decrease is due primarily to a million charge for the write off of capitalized software costs associated with an information system project involving a computer system to administer medical professional liability policies and claims 
the information system project  which began in the fall of  was not producing the anticipated results and management decided to discontinue the project 
in addition  we wrote off approximately  of capitalized leasehold improvements related to office space that we lease in chicago  illinois during the fourth quarter of the decision was made not to use the improved space for its intended purpose  and the space was subleased in the fourth quarter of accordingly  the leasehold improvements associated with the subleased space were considered impaired  and written off 
at december  we have no recorded deferred federal income tax assets due to the establishment of a valuation allowance during based on the company s recent loss experience  it is uncertain that sufficient taxable income will exist in the periods when the deductible temporary differences that gave rise to the deferred tax assets are expected to reverse 
once the company has re established a pattern of profitability  the deferred tax asset valuation allowance may be reduced in whole or in part upon evaluation of the availability of future taxable income 
during  we acquired intangible assets with respect to certain covenants not to compete in connection with our investment in pic and the retirement of our former president and ceo 
these assets are discussed more fully in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

unearned premiums decreased million  or  to million at december  the decrease is primarily due to our exit from the workers compensation lines of business during there is less than  of direct unearned premium  million on a net basis  remaining related to workers compensation as of december  in may  we issued million of debentures 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these transactions 
such information is incorporated herein by reference 

table of contents accrued expenses and other liabilities at december  were million  an increase of million compared to december  this increase was primarily attributable to million in payables for securities at december  partially offset by a decrease of million in ceded reinsurance premiums payable  primarily related to our medical professional liability reinsurance treaties  and a million decrease in premiums paid in advance 
our medical professional liability reinsurance treaties are swing rated  on a retrospective basis 
in accordance with the treaties  we pay a provisional premium to the reinsurer  and after three years  the provisional premium is either increased or decreased depending on the actual loss experience on the business written during a given treaty year 
in light of our recent loss experience  we have recorded ceded premiums during and at approximately the maximum liability due under the treaties 
shareholders equity at december  was million  an increase of  from million at december  retained earnings increased million as a result of the net income recorded for the year ended december  this increase was offset by a decrease in unrealized appreciation on investments  net of tax  of million 
the decrease in unrealized gains was due to declines in market values of fixed income securities caused by rising interest rates and due to the recognition of some gains during the year as we realigned our investment portfolio 
changes in the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance accounted for an additional million negative effect on equity 
the company s book value per common share outstanding at december  was per share  based on  shares outstanding  compared to per common share outstanding at december  total shares outstanding at december  were  off balance sheet arrangements in may  we formed two subsidiary statutory trusts for the purpose of issuing mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities  referred to as trust preferred securities 
the proceeds from the trust preferred securities that were issued were used by the trusts to purchase debentures issued by apcapital 
apcapital used the amounts borrowed pursuant to these debentures to increase its available capital and has subsequently contributed substantially all of the proceeds to american physicians to increase its statutory surplus 
the debentures and the trust preferred securities have terms and maturities that mirror each other 
in accordance with the guidance given in financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 variable interest entities  we have not consolidated these subsidiary trusts 
apcapital has guaranteed that amounts paid to the trusts related to the debentures  will subsequently be remitted to the holders of the trust preferred securities 
in accordance with the nature of the transactions  the amounts guaranteed by apcapital  are also recorded as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements  as they represent obligations to the trusts  which are in turn obligated to the holders of the trust preferred securities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we invest primarily in fixed maturity securities  which are interest sensitive assets 
accordingly  our primary market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates 
as of december   the majority of our investment portfolio was invested in fixed maturity securities 
the fixed maturity securities primarily consisted of us government and agency bonds  high quality corporate bonds  mortgage backed securities and tax exempt us municipal bonds 
qualitative information about market risk investments in our portfolio have varying degrees of risk 
the primary market risk exposure to the fixed maturity portfolio is interest rate risk  which is limited somewhat by our management of duration 
the distribution of maturities and sector concentrations are monitored on a regular basis 
equity securities are carried at quoted market values 
the fair value of publicly traded fixed maturity securities is based upon independent market quotations 
the fair value of non publicly traded securities is based on independent third party pricing sources that use valuation models 
the valuation models used by the independent third party pricing sources use indicative information such as ratings  industry  coupon  and maturity along with publicly traded bond prices to determine security specific spreads  and the ultimate fair value of the non publicly traded fixed maturity securities 
realized gains or losses on sales or maturities of investments are determined on a specific identification basis and are credited or charged to income 
at december   all of our fixed maturity portfolio excluding approximately million of private placement issues  which is approximately of the total fixed income security portfolio was considered investment grade 
we define investment grade securities as those that have a standards poors credit rating of bbb and above 
non investment grade securities typically bear more credit risk than those of investment grade quality 
credit risk is the risk that amounts due the company by creditors may not ultimately be collected 
we periodically review our investment portfolio for any potential credit quality or collection issues and for any securities with respect to which we consider any decline in market value to be other than temporary 
our policy for recording otti write downs is more fully discussed in item management s discussion and analysis significant accounting policies  investments 
the cross referenced information is included herein by reference 
during  we liquidated our million high yield bond investment portfolio for a pre tax gain of million 
in addition  we liquidated the majority of our other non investment grade securities for a pre tax gain of million 
the liquidation of our high yield bonds and other non investment grade securities has reduced the overall risk level associated with our investment portfolio  but is likely to decrease future investment income as we reinvest in lower risk  lower yielding securities 
approximately million of the mortgage backed securities purchased are interest only certificates 
unlike traditional fixed maturity securities  the fair value of these investments is not inversely related to interest rates  but rather  moves in the same direction as interest rates as the underlying financial instruments are mortgage backed securities 
with mortgage backed securities  as interest rates rise  prepayments will decrease  which means that the interest only certificates will generate interest for a longer period of time than originally anticipated  which in turn will increase the fair value of these investments 
approximately million of these interest only certificates have an inverse floating rate of interest tied to the london interbank offered rate 
the company has determined that these inverse floating interest only certificates contain an embedded derivative as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative 
table of contents instruments and hedging activities 
because the company cannot readily segregate the fair value of the embedded derivative from the host debt instrument  the entire change in the fair value of these inverse floating interest only certificates is reported in earnings as investment income 
for the years ended december  and  a loss of approximately  and a gain of approximately  respectively  were included in investment income for the change in fair value of the inverse floating interest only certificates 
quantitative information about market risk at december   our fixed income security portfolio was valued at million and had an average modified duration of years  compared to a portfolio valued at million with an average modified duration of years at december  of the million at december   million were interest only certificates that had a modified duration of years  compared to million of interest only certificates with a modified duration of at december  the following tables show the effects of a change in interest rates on the fair value and duration of our entire fixed maturity portfolio at december  and  and then separately for our interest only certificates
