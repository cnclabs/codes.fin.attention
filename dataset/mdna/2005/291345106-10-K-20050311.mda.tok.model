item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general emisphere technologies  inc is a biopharmaceutical company specializing in the oral delivery of therapeutic macromolecules and other compounds that are not currently deliverable by oral means 
since our inception in  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to research and development conducted on our own behalf and in collaborations with corporate partners and academic research institutions 
our product pipeline includes product candidates for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases  osteoporosis  growth disorders  diabetes  asthma allergies  obesity and infectious diseases 
development and commercialization of these product candidates entails risk and significant expense 
since inception  we have had no product sales from these product candidates 
business overview we have developed and continue to enhance the human resource and physical infrastructure necessary to achieve our goal of becoming the premier oral drug delivery company 
we have a significant and growing patent estate to protect our discoveries  proprietary technologies and carrier library 
we continue to invest resources in research capabilities that improve our understanding of the mechanisms of action of the carriers in order to select the appropriate carriers to deliver the drug candidate in the most efficient manner  redesign and update our computer modeling and in vitro testing capabilities to optimize carrier drug selection  select animal models that best mimic the human response  explore the formulation of drug and carrier to optimize delivery  and study oral  buccal  transdermal  sublingual and topical approaches to drug delivery 
we utilize resources to  among other things  conduct feasibility studies to determine if an emisphere carrier can deliver a given drug 
a feasibility study is a pre clinical or clinical study of approximately six months 
we conduct feasibility studies when we believe that significant opportunities exist  or when requested by pharmaceutical companies who seek our assistance to deliver an injectable drug or to improve the delivery of an oral drug 
the costs of these studies typically are reimbursed 
from these feasibility studies  further collaborations may develop  including larger clinical studies and partnerships 
government  universities and other biotech companies 
the costs of these studies may or may not be reimbursed 
as a result of our strategy  our partners novartis and roche are  at their own expense  actively developing sct and an unnamed small molecule compound  respectively  using emisphere carriers 
in  our primary focus was on developing oral heparin and insulin  which are self funded projects 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  contract research revenue was approximately million in  representing an increase of approximately million or  compared to the year ended december  revenue for primarily related to licensing revenue from initiation of the roche collaboration for an unnamed small molecule compound and the novartis collaboration for rhgh 
total operating expenses were approximately million for  a decrease of approximately million or  compared to the year ended december  total operating expenses include research and development costs of million  a decrease of million or  compared to the year ended december  the decrease consisted of a million decrease in occupancy costs  a million decrease in clinical trial expenses  and a million decrease in all other research costs 
the decrease in occupancy costs was due to the surrender of a portion of the leased space at the tarrytown facility in late the decrease in clinical trial expenses primarily was due to the final reconciliation of payments related to the protect liquid oral heparin trials 
the decrease in all other research costs of million consisted of million in reduced compensation and related expenses  million in reduced lab clinical supply costs  and million in lower consulting and other miscellaneous costs 
general and administrative expenses for were approximately million  an increase of approximately million  or  compared to the year ended december  the increase is primarily the result of increased professional fees associated with the litigation with lilly 
tarrytown facility transaction during  in order to streamline operations and reduce expenditures  we entered into a transaction to surrender to the landlord approximately of our leased space the surrendered space at the tarrytown facility 
the surrendered space primarily consists of office space  which was subsequently leased to another tenant the subsequent tenant at the tarrytown facility 
annual cost savings from the transaction are expected to be approximately million for the remainder of the lease term  which extends through august in the event that the subsequent tenant vacates the space before august   we are contingently liable for the rent payments and will be required to re let the space through august  completion of the lease amendment and related agreements took place in october in connection with this transaction  we agreed to sell most of the furniture and equipment in the surrendered space to the subsequent tenant 
the subsequent tenant has agreed to make certain payments furniture payments which will be made directly to the landlord on a monthly basis 
a rental credit equal to the furniture payment will be applied against our rent payment to the landlord on a monthly basis 
total payments under the agreement are approximately million and extend through august the transaction between emisphere and the subsequent tenant has been accounted for as an operating lease  with all furniture payments recorded as rental income 
we retain a security interest in the furniture and equipment until all required payments have been made 
the lease of these assets will result in a reduction of depreciation expense of million in each of years and  and million in through we compared the net book value of the furniture and equipment to be leased to the fair value  which was determined to be the net present value of the furniture payments  or million  and determined that the assets were impaired 
based on this evaluation  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the year ended december   which was included in loss on impairment of intangible and fixed assets on the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   we performed an evaluation of the assets being leased and determined that no impairment had occurred 
farmington facility transaction we own a facility of  square feet located on acres of land in farmington  connecticut 
in the third quarter of  we announced our decision to cease operations at and sell the facility 
we do not currently have a purchaser for this facility and we cannot be certain when or if we will consummate a sale of the facility 
a previously interested purchaser terminated its interest in the facility subsequent to year end and we may not find an alternate buyer 
in january  an adjoining landowner filed a notice of pendency on the property claiming certain rights under a right of way  and in addition filed suit in a matter captioned farmington avenue baptist church  plaintiff  vs 
farm tech corporation  defendant  superior court of the state of connecticut  judicial district of hartford 
depositions of the pastor and the attorney for the adjoining landowner have been completed 
this litigation is ongoing and may have an adverse effect on our ability to sell the facility 
costs associated with maintaining the facility eg  utilities  insurance  maintenance and real estate taxes were approximately million in and will continue at approximately the same level until the facility is sold 
as of december   we performed an evaluation of the land  building and equipment available for sale at the farmington facility  which has a carrying value of million 
we evaluated the following two components of the facility i land  building and equipment that would most likely be transferred to the buyer when the sale is consummated such as equipment which is attached to the structure and expensive to remove  and ii equipment that is portable and available for sale and would most likely be retained by us 
we evaluated the land  building and attached equipment based on an appraisal from a real estate broker which was qualified regarding the litigation discussed above and determined that an impairment loss on the carrying value of the land  building and attached equipment had not been triggered 
in the event that we are not successful in selling the farmington facility  we may need to record an impairment loss on the land  building and attached equipment 
subsequent to the decision to sell the farmington facility  we transferred equipment with a net book value of million for use at the tarrytown facility and equipment with a net book value of million was sold 
the remaining items of equipment were then evaluated for potential impairment 
the evaluations were based on the age and condition of the equipment  potential offers from third parties  quotes from scientific equipment resellers  and recent sales of similar equipment at auction or by us 
based on this evaluation  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the year ended december   which was included in loss on impairment of intangible and fixed assets on the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   we performed an evaluation of the equipment held for sale at the farmington facility and determined that no impairment had occurred 
the land  building  and equipment at the farmington facility that are available for sale are included at their carrying value in land  building and equipment held for sale  net on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of december  the million of equipment transferred out of the farmington facility is included in equipment and leasehold improvements  net on the consolidated balance sheets 
purchased technology impairment at december   we performed an evaluation of the recoverability of the remaining purchased technology related to the solid forms of oral heparin 
we are proceeding with planned studies related to this formulation and we estimate that future undiscounted cash flows from programs related to the solid forms of oral heparin are sufficient to realize the carrying value of the asset 
therefore  an impairment of the remaining purchased technology has not occurred as of december  a negative outcome in the development of solid oral heparin may trigger a write down of related patents  currently valued at million  in the future 
estimated amortization expense for the purchased technology is million for each of the next five years 
depreciation and amortization costs were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or  as compared to the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to the surrender of the leased space at the tarrytown facility at the end of overall  our operating loss was million for  a decrease of million  or  compared to the year ended december  the operating loss of million for included restructuring and impairment charges of million 
there were no restructuring and impairment charges in excluding restructuring and impairment charges  the operating loss represents a million decrease compared to the operating loss 
other expense and income was million of expense for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to the year ended december  the change is primarily the result of a decrease in investment income of million  plus an increase in interest expense of million related to the note due to elan 
see liquidity and capital resources for further discussion concerning the elan note 
the decrease in investment income resulted from lower cash and investment balances 
as a result of the above factors  we sustained a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  contract research revenue was million in  representing a decrease of million or compared to the year ended december  revenue for primarily related to research and development expense reimbursements under collaborative agreements with lilly 
the decrease primarily was attributable to the winding down of rhgh phase i clinical studies in collaboration with lilly 
costs associated with contract research revenue approximate such revenue and are included in research and development expenses 
total operating expenses were million for  a decrease of million  or  compared to the year ended december  total operating expenses included restructuring costs and loss on asset impairment of million 
the total operating expenses for  excluding the restructuring costs and loss on asset impairment  were million  a decrease of million  or compared to the year ended december  the details of this decrease are outlined below 
the impact of the discontinuation of our liquid oral heparin project and the subsequent restructuring and impairment charges are outlined in restructuring and loss on impairment of intangible and fixed assets below 
research and development costs were million for  a decrease of million or  compared to the year ended december  the decrease consisted of a million decrease in clinical trial expenses and a million decrease in all other research costs 
the decrease in clinical trial expenses primarily was due to a million decrease in protect related clinical trial expenses resulting from the completion of the trial and a million decrease in phase i proof of concept clinical trial expenses resulting from the completion of the trials for rhgh  oral insulin  solid oral heparin  and cromolyn sodium 
the decrease in all other research costs of million consisted of million in reduced compensation and related expenses  million in reduced lab clinical supplies costs  million in lower consulting and professional fees and million in lower operating costs 
overall  a majority of the decrease in other research costs was due to the completion of the protect trial and the subsequent reduction in work force and closing of our connecticut research facility farmtech  both of which were initiated in the impact in of the closing of our farmtech operations was a million decrease in other research costs  which is included in the million total decrease in other research costs 
during  we did not incur any significant project costs related to the liquid oral heparin program and related initiatives other than certain close out expenses 
as a result  the liquid oral heparin project expense for excluding restructuring and impairment costs decreased by a total of million compared to the year ended december   consisting of a decrease of million in clinical trial expenses  million in compensation and travel costs  million in consulting  million in lab clinical supplies  million in production facility design work and million in all other expenses 
general and administrative expenses for were million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the year ended december  the decrease primarily was the result of a decrease of million in compensation and related expenses due to the elimination of the chief operating officer s position in  a decline in severance costs  lower headcount and lower relocation expenses 
the remaining decrease of million primarily was related to the closing of our farmtech operations and the reduction of research and development support activity 
restructuring 
in  we announced a plan for restructuring our operations  which included the discontinuation of our liquid oral heparin program and related initiatives  and a reduction of associated infrastructure 
additionally  in the third quarter of  we evaluated several alternatives to consolidate our two research facilities located in tarrytown  new york and farmington  connecticut in order to eliminate excess capacity  reduce spending  and raise cash 
we decided to dispose of the farmington research facility 
as a result of the restructuring plan  we announced a reduction in force  which was implemented during may and june at the tarrytown facility and november and december at the farmington facility 
restructuring charges were adjusted by thousand and thousand in and  respectively  to reflect actual expenditures 
the reduction in force in included the termination of full time and temporary employees  including administrative personnel and scientists and research assistants 
four additional employees at the farmington research facility were terminated in we paid thousand in stay bonuses to certain farmtech employees who were asked to remain at the facility for an extended period of time during the phase out of the facility 
the restructuring plan resulted in the reduction of our full time work force by approximately 
the following table presents the original restructuring accruals for tarrytown and farmington  the adjustments to these accruals  and the amounts paid through december  estimated restructuring expenses actual disbursements adjustments restructuring reserve as of december  in thousands severance and accrued vacation outplacement services employee benefits contract exit costs other total loss on impairment of intangible and fixed assets 
we recorded asset impairments in and resulting from our decision to refocus operations and reduce costs and to surrender of our leased space in tarrytown  new york to the landlord and to lease some of the equipment in that space to the subsequent tenant see tarrytown facility transaction below 
management assessed the recoverability of certain intangible and fixed assets related to the oral liquid heparin program and the associated infrastructure 
a loss on impairment was recorded in of million  an increase of million or over the prior year  which includes an impairment charge of million related to furniture and equipment situated at the tarrytown facility 
the remaining million represents a write down of certain farmtech assets to fair value  which was assessed based on the age and condition of the equipment  potential offers from third parties  quotes from scientific equipment resellers  and recent sales of similar equipment at auction or by us 
also in  we concluded that a total impairment was required with respect to the portion of the purchased technology representing patents related to the discontinued liquid oral heparin program 
we recorded an impairment charge of million  comprised of million for purchased technology and million for fixed assets which were to be used for the liquid oral heparin development program 
tarrytown facility transaction during  in order to streamline operations and reduce expenditures  we entered into a transaction to surrender to the landlord approximately of the leased space the surrendered space at our tarrytown facility 
the surrendered space primarily consists of office space  which was subsequently leased to another tenant the subsequent tenant at the tarrytown facility 
annual cost savings from the transaction are expected to be approximately million for the remainder of the lease term  which extends through august in the event that the subsequent tenant vacates the space before august   we are contingently liable for the rent payments and will be required to re let the space through august  completion of the lease amendment and related agreements took place in october the agreement describes four distinct areas to be surrendered  three of which were vacated and surrendered to the subsequent tenant as of december  the fourth space was vacated in march in connection with this transaction  we agreed to sell most of the furniture and equipment in the surrendered space to the subsequent tenant 
through a contractual agreement with us  the subsequent tenant has agreed to make certain payments furniture payments which will be made directly to the landlord on a monthly basis 
a rental credit equal to each furniture payment will be applied against our rent payment to the landlord on a monthly basis 
total payments under the agreement are million and extend through august the transaction between the subsequent tenant and us has been accounted for as an operating lease  with all furniture payments recorded as rental income 
we retain a security interest in the furniture and equipment until all required payments have been made 
prior to the transaction  we removed assets with a net book value of million for use elsewhere in the tarrytown facility 
we compared the net book value of the furniture and equipment to be leased to the fair value  which was determined to be the net present value of the furniture payments  or million  and determined that the assets were impaired 
based on this evaluation  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the year ended december   which has been included in loss on impairment of intangible and fixed assets on the consolidated statements of operations 
the lease of these assets will result in a reduction of depreciation expense of million in each of years    and million in years through farmington facility transaction in the third quarter of  we decided to dispose of our farmington  connecticut research facility 
we do not currently have a purchaser for this facility and we cannot be certain when or if we will consummate a sale of the facility 
a previously interested purchaser has terminated its interest in the facility and we may not find an alternate buyer 
as of december   we performed an evaluation of the land  building and equipment available for sale at the farmington facility  which has a carrying value of million 
we evaluated the following two components of the facility i land  building and equipment that would most likely be transferred to the buyer when the sale is consummated such as equipment which is attached to the structure and expensive to remove  and ii equipment that is portable and available for sale and would most likely be retained by us 
we evaluated the land  building and attached equipment based on the sale price in the contract and determined that an impairment loss of the carrying value of the land  building and attached equipment had not occurred as of december  in the event that we are not successful in selling the farmington facility  we may need to record an impairment loss on the land  building and attached equipment 
subsequent to the decision to sell the farmington facility  we transferred equipment with a net book value of million for use at the tarrytown facility and equipment with a net book value of million was sold 
the remaining equipment was then evaluated individually for potential impairment 
the evaluations were based on the age and condition of the equipment  potential offers from third parties  quotes from scientific equipment resellers  and recent sales of similar equipment at auction or by us 
based on this evaluation  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the year ended december   which has been included in loss on impairment of intangible and fixed assets on the consolidated statement of operations 
the land  building  and equipment at the farmington facility that are available for sale are included at their carrying value in land  building and equipment held for sale  net on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of december  the million of equipment transferred out of the farmington facility is included in equipment and leasehold improvements  net on the consolidated balance sheets 
purchased technology impairment at december   we performed an evaluation of the recoverability of the remaining purchased technology related to the solid forms of oral heparin 
we are proceeding with planned studies related to this formulation and we estimate that future undiscounted cash flows from programs related to the solid forms of oral heparin are sufficient to realize the carrying value of the asset 
therefore  an impairment of the remaining purchased technology has not been triggered as of december  the net carrying value of the remaining purchased technology is million 
a negative outcome in the development of solid oral heparin may trigger a write down of related patents in the future 
estimated amortization expense for the purchased technology is thousand for each of the next five years 
depreciation and amortization costs were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  as compared to the year ended december  this decrease is primarily the result of depreciation expense related to the farmington research facility  which was classified as held for sale as of december  and therefore was not depreciated during  offset by increases in depreciation for assets put into service at the tarrytown facility in overall  our operating loss was million including the restructuring and impairment charges in the year ended december   a decrease of million as compared to a million operating loss for the year ended december  excluding the restructuring and asset impairment charges the operating loss was million in the year ended december  or a decrease of million compared to other expense and income was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  as compared to the change is primarily the result of a decrease in investment income of million  plus an increase in interest expense of million related to the note due to elan 
see liquidity and capital resources for further information concerning the elan note 
the decrease in investment income resulted from lower cash and investment balances and lower interest rates 
as a result of the above factors  we sustained a net loss of million  including restructuring and impairment charges  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
excluding the restructuring and impairment charges the net loss was million in the year ended december   a decrease of million or compared to liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  we have generated significant losses from operations and we anticipate that we will continue to generate significant losses from operations for the foreseeable future 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
our net loss was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our cash outlays from operations and capital expenditures were million for our stockholders equity decreased from million as of december  to a stockholders deficit of million as of december  we have also made substantial debt payments to elan and have commitments to make additional payments during we have limited capital resources and operations to date have been funded with the proceeds from collaborative research agreements  public and private equity and debt financings and income earned on investments 
these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the audit report prepared by our independent registered public accounting firm relating to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  includes an explanatory paragraph expressing the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources  without implementing cost reductions  raising additional capital  or obtaining substantial cash inflows from potential partners for our products  will enable us to continue operations through the end of the second quarter of should we be unable to raise needed capital by april  we have developed a plan whereby we would significantly decrease operating costs by reducing our workforce and scaling back research and development efforts 
these decreases would allow us to continue to operate through december  however  if our restructuring efforts as discussed herein are not sufficient due to unanticipated costs and expenses  we may be required to discontinue  shutdown  or cease operations 
we are continuing to address our liquidity issues through various means including the financing matters discussed below 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments totaling million  a decrease of  compared to december  net cash used in operations was million in  as compared to million in the year ended december   a decrease of million resulting from continued cost cutting initiatives and the receipt of upfront payments associated with new collaborations entered into in capital expenditures were million in compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the decrease in capital expenditures was primarily due to continued cost cutting initiatives 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to cash provided of million during the year ended december   a change of million 
this use of cash in reflects the early paydown of the elan note payable  partially offset by the proceeds of the convertible note payable issued to novartis 
the proceeds from the exercise of stock options increased by million from  due to higher prices of our common stock  particularly during the first quarter of on december   we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with kingsbridge  providing for the commitment of kingsbridge to purchase up to million of our common stock until december  in return for the commitment  we issued to kingsbridge a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of representing a premium to the market price of shares of our common stock on the date of issuance of the warrant 
under the terms of the common stock purchase agreement  we may  at our election  draw funds from kingsbridge in amounts up to of our market capitalization at the time of the draw 
only one drawdown is permitted per drawdown pricing period  which is a period of days  with a minimum of trading days between each drawdown pricing period 
in exchange for each draw  we will sell to kingsbridge newly issued shares of our common stock priced at a discount of between of the average trading price of our common stock during the financing period  with the reduced discount applying if the price of the common stock is equal to or greater than per share 
we will set the minimum acceptable purchase price of any shares to be issued to kingsbridge during the term of the common stock purchase agreement  which  in no event  may be less than per share 
our right to begin drawing funds will commence upon the sec s declaring effective a registration statement to be filed by us 
we are under no obligation to access any of the capital available under the common stock purchase agreement 
kingsbridge may terminate this agreement based on material adverse effects on our business  operations  properties or financial condition excluding material adverse effects relating to formation or dissolution of partnerships or the results of any clinical trials 
in addition  we can effect other debt and equity financings without restriction  provided that such financings do not use any floating or other post issuance adjustable discount to the market price of our common stock 
kingsbridge is precluded from short selling any of our common stock during the term of the common stock purchase agreement 
in  we entered into a joint venture with elan to develop oral heparin 
in connection with the re purchase of elan s joint venture interest in  we issued a zero coupon note the original elan note to elan 
the original elan note had an issue price of million and an original issue discount at maturity of million and a maturity date of july  on december   we entered into a security purchase agreement with elan  providing for our purchase of our indebtedness to elan under the original elan note 
the value of the original elan note plus accrued interest on december  was approximately million 
pursuant to the security purchase agreement  we paid elan million and issued to elan  shares of our common stock with a market value of approximately million 
also  we issued to elan a new zero coupon note with an issue price of approximately million the modified elan note  representing the accrued value of the original elan note minus the sum of the cash payment and the value of the  shares 
under the security purchase agreement  we have the right to make a cash payment of million and issue  shares on april  and a final cash payment of million and the issuance of  shares of our common stock on june  in exchange for the remaining balance of the modified elan note 
alternatively  prior to march   we have the right to make a cash payment of million  and issue to elan a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock with an exercise price equal to the volume weighted average price for our common stock for the period of twenty consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the date of issuance of such warrant in exchange for the modified elan note 
we may also defer the cash payments and the common stock issuances to a date not later than september  if we exercise that right and elect to defer the million installment due on april   we are required to issue to elan an adjusted modified note the adjusted note equal to the outstanding balance of the modified elan note plus approximately million the value of the  shares issued on december  in exchange for the modified elan note and we will be obligated to pay elan thousand per month for each month during which the adjusted note remains outstanding 
if we do not complete the payments and the common stock issuances by september   we will be obligated to continue the payment of thousand per month until the full repayment of the adjusted note any time between september  and the maturity date of the original elan note july  
on december  we issued a million convertible note the novartis note to novartis in connection with a new research collaboration option relating to the development of pth the novartis note bears interest at a rate of prior to december   from december  through december   and from that point until maturity on december  we have the option to pay interest in cash on a current basis or accrue the periodic interest as an addition to the principal amount of the novartis note 
we may convert the novartis note at any time prior to maturity into a number of shares of our common stock equal to the principal and accrued and unpaid interest to be converted divided by the then market price of our common stock  provided certain conditions are met  including that the number of shares issued to novartis  when issued  does not exceed of the total shares of company common stock outstanding  that at the time of such conversion no event of default under the note has occurred and is continuing  and that there is either an effective shelf registration statement in effect covering the resale of the shares issued in connection with such conversion or the shares may be resold by novartis pursuant to sec rule k 
under the novartis note  an event of default shall be deemed to have occurred if we default on the payment of the principal amount of  and accrued and unpaid interest on  the novartis note upon maturity  we suffer a bankruptcy or similar insolvency event or proceeding  we materially breach a representation or warranty  we fail to timely cure a default in the payment of any other indebtedness in excess of a certain material threshold  or there occurs an acceleration of indebtedness in excess of that threshold  we suffer and do not discharge in a timely manner a final judgment for the payment of a sum in excess of a certain material threshold  we become entitled to terminate the registration of our securities or the filing of reports under the securities exchange act of  our common stock will be delisted from nasdaq  we experience a change of control including by  among other things  a change in the composition of a majority of our board other than as approved by the board in any one year period  a merger which results in our stockholders holding shares that represent less than a majority of the voting power of the merged entity  and any other acquisition by a third party of shares that represent a majority of the voting power of the company  we sell substantially all of our assets  or we are effectively unable to honor or perform our obligations under the new research collaboration option relating to the development of pth upon the occurrence of any such event of default prior to conversion  any unpaid principal and accrued interest on the novartis note would become immediately due and payable 
if the novartis note is converted into our common stock  novartis would have the right to require us to repurchase the shares of common stock within six months after an event of default under the novartis note  for an aggregate purchase price equal to the principal and interest that was converted  plus interest from the date of conversion  as if no conversion had occurred 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no material off balance sheet arrangements  other than operating leases 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into agreements with third parties that include indemnification provisions which  in our judgment  are normal and customary for companies in our industry sector 
these agreements are typically with business partners  clinical sites  and suppliers 
pursuant to these agreements  we generally agree to indemnify  hold harmless  and reimburse indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified parties with respect to our product candidates  use of such product candidates  or other actions taken or omitted by us 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited 
we have not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions 
as a result  the estimated fair value of liabilities relating to these provisions is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these provisions as of december  in the normal course of business  we may be confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability 
these generally relate to lawsuits  claims  environmental actions or the actions of various regulatory agencies 
we consult with counsel and other appropriate experts to assess the claim 
if  in our opinion  we have incurred a probable loss as set forth by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  an estimate is made of the loss and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
after consultation with legal counsel  we do not anticipate that liabilities arising out of currently pending or threatened lawsuits and claims  including the pending litigation described in part i  item legal proceedings  will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
significant contractual obligations as of december  are as follows amount due in type of obligation total obligation less than year to years to years more than years in thousands long term debt short term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations clinical research organizations total in july  we acquired from elan our ownership interest in ebbisham a jointly owned entity created by us and elan  in exchange for a seven year   zero coupon note due july carrying a interest rate  compounding semi annually the elan note  plus royalties on oral heparin product sales  subject to an annual maximum and certain milestone payments 
in connection with any payment on the elan note made by the emisphere  we have the right to require elan to purchase our common stock at the market price at an aggregate price equal to such payment made  subject to the following conditions i the acceptance by the fda of a new drug application from emisphere involving any heparin product  ii our closing stock price remaining at or above per share for the consecutive trading days prior to the date we exercise this right and iii the exercise of this right would not require the application of the equity accounting method by elan 
in december  we entered into a security purchase agreement with elan and made a prepayment on the note of million in cash and million in common stock 
see liquidity and capital resources above for further information concerning the elan note and related security purchase agreement 
at december   the balance on the elan note was million 
in december  we issued a million convertible note payable to novartis the novartis note due december interest may be paid annually or accreted as additional principal 
we may convert the novartis note at any time prior to maturity into a number of shares of our common stock equal to the principal and accrued and unpaid interest to be converted divided by the then market price of our common stock  provided certain conditions are met  including that the number of shares issued to novartis  when issued  does not exceed of the total shares of company common stock outstanding  that at the time of such conversion no event of default under the note has occurred and is continuing  and that there is either an effective shelf registration statement in effect covering the resale of the shares issued in connection with such conversion or the shares may be resold by novartis pursuant to sec rule k 
upon the occurrence of an event of default prior to conversion  any unpaid principal and accrued interest on the novartis note would become immediately due and payable

at december   the balance on the novartis note was million 
the operating lease is related to the tarrytown facility 
under the terms of the agreement with the landlord to surrender a portion of this space in  we are contingently liable for the rent payments and will be required to re let the space through august  if the subsequent tenant vacates the surrendered space before august  we have excluded such payments from the above table because we believe that the possibility of such an event occurring is remote 
in the event that the subsequent tenant vacates the space  the maximum amount which we would be obligated to pay would be million million in less than one year and million in one to three years for rent  real estate taxes and operating expenses 
we are obligated to make payments under certain contracts with third parties who provide clinical research services to support our ongoing research and development 
research and development costs we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to research and development conducted on our own behalf self funded and in collaborations with corporate partners partnered 
generally  research and development expenditures are allocated to specific research projects 
due to various uncertainties and risks  including those described in risk factors below  relating to the progress of our product candidates through development stages  clinical trials  regulatory approval  commercialization and market acceptance  it is not possible to accurately predict future spending or time to completion by project or project category 
the following table summarizes research and development spending to date by project category year ended december  cumulative spending to date research feasibility projects self funded partnered development projects oral heparin self funded oral insulin self funded partnered all other self funded other total all projects cumulative spending from august  through december  research is classified as resources expended to expand the ability to create new carriers  to ascertain the mechanisms of action of carriers  and to establish computer based modeling capabilities  prototype formulations  animal models  and in vitro testing capabilities 
during the year ended december   thousand of research and development expenses  related to certain projects  was reclassified as restructuring for severance charges in the consolidated statement of operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states involves the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
certain of these estimates and assumptions are considered to be critical accounting policies  due to their complexity  subjectivity  and uncertainty  along with their relevance to our financial performance 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
these policies and their key characteristics are outlined below 
investments 
we invest excess cash in accordance with a policy objective seeking to preserve both liquidity and safety of principal 
we consider all highly liquid  interest bearing debt instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents may include demand deposits held in banks and interest bearing money market funds 
investments are carried at fair value and are considered to be available for sale 
accordingly  unrealized holding gains and losses are reported in stockholders equity 
we generally invest our excess funds in obligations of the us government and its agencies  bank deposits  mortgage backed securities  and investment grade debt securities issued by corporations and financial institutions at ratings of a or a standard and poor s 
although our investments carry high ratings when purchased  a lowering of the rating of the corporate debt securities in our portfolio could result in an impairment 
purchased technology 
purchased technology represents the value assigned to patents underlying research and development projects of ebbisham ltd  related to oral heparin  that were commenced but not yet completed as of the date of our acquisition of full ownership and which  if unsuccessful  have no alternative future use 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  the fair value of purchased technology is reviewed for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable 
an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value  is triggered if the carrying amount exceeds estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
at december   purchased technology had a carrying value of million  net of amortization 
we amortize purchased technology on a straight line basis over a period of years  the average life of the related patents 
estimated amortization expense for the purchased technology is thousand for each of the next five years 
equipment and leasehold improvements 
equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost 
depreciation and amortization are provided for on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or of the improvements whichever is shorter 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs that do not materially extend the useful lives of the respective assets are charged to expense as incurred 
the cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization of assets retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts and any gain or loss is recognized in operations 
impairment of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas  we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value  is triggered if the carrying amount exceeds estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
we recognized impairments on long lived assets of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
these impairments were based on estimates of future cash flows  including potential offers from third parties  quotes from scientific equipment resellers  and recent sales of similar equipment at auction or by us 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates  which would result in additional impairment losses or losses on disposal of the assets 
clinical trial accrual methodology 
clinical trial expenses represent obligations resulting from our contracts with various research organizations in connection with conducting clinical trials for our product candidates 
we account for those expenses on an accrual basis according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient enrollment and the timing of the various aspects of the trial 
accruals are recorded in accordance with the following methodology i the costs for period expenses  such as investigator meetings and initial start up costs  are expensed as incurred based on management s estimates  which are impacted by any change in the number of sites  number of patients and patient start dates  ii direct service costs  which are primarily on going monitoring costs  are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the contract  and iii principal investigator expenses that are directly associated with recruitment are recognized based on actual patient recruitment 
all changes to the contract amounts due to change orders are analyzed and recognized in accordance with the above methodology 
change orders are triggered by changes in the scope  time to completion and the number of sites 
during the course of a trial  we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  and financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force no 
accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
revenue includes amounts earned from collaborative agreements and feasibility studies and is comprised of reimbursed research and development costs  as well as upfront and research and development milestone payments 
deferred revenue represents payments received which are related to future performance 
non refundable upfront and research and development milestone payments and payments for services are recognized as revenue as the related services are performed over the term of the collaboration 
revenue recognized is the lower of the percentage complete  measured by incurred costs  applied to expected contractual payments or the total non refundable cash received to date 
with regards to revenue from non refundable fees  changes in assumptions of estimated costs to complete could have a material impact on the revenue recognized 
revenue is expected to fluctuate from year to year and is dependent upon the timing of work plans mutually agreed to with collaborators and to the allocation of efforts between emisphere and our collaborators 
future impact of recently issued accounting standards in march  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf  regarding disclosures about unrealized losses on available for sale debt and equity securities accounted for under sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the scope of the consensus is to give guidance on when an investment is impaired  whether the impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
the effective date of the recognition and measurement guidance in eitf has been delayed until the implementation guidance provided by a fasb staff position on the issue is finalized 
the disclosure guidance is unaffected by the delay and is effective for fiscal years ending after june  we adopted the disclosure provisions of eitf in our annual financial statements for the year ended december  and do not anticipate that the recognition and measurement guidance  when released  will significantly impact our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
the revised statement  sfas r  share based payment  establishes standards for share based transactions in which an entity receives employee s services for a equity instruments of the entity  such as stock options  or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas r eliminates the option of accounting for share based compensation transactions using apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and requires that companies expense the fair value of employee stock options and similar awards  as measured on the awards grant date 
for public companies  sfas r is effective at the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  we plan to adopt sfas r in our fiscal quarter ending september  sfas r applies to all awards granted after the date of adoption  and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after that date 
we may apply sfas r using one of the following transition methods 
we may apply sfas r using a modified version of prospective application only  under which compensation cost is recognized only for the portion of awards outstanding for which the requisite service has not been rendered as of the adoption date  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under sfas for pro forma disclosures 
we may also elect to apply a modified version of retrospective application  which involves restating our financial statements to give effect to the fair value based method of accounting for awards on a basis consistent with the disclosures required by sfas for either all prior periods for which sfas was effective or prior interim periods in the year of adoption only 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas r  including developing a valuation model and selecting a transition method 
we expect the adoption of sfas r will have significant impact on our financial statements  but we have not determined the extent of the impact 
transactions with related parties during  two former members of the board of directors resigned their board positions and became consultants to emisphere 
risk factors the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward looking statements that we make in this report and elsewhere including oral statements from time to time 
any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business  our operating results  our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward looking statements are made in this report 
we have incurred substantial losses since inception and as we expect to continue to incur development expenses for self funded programs and partnered programs and for programs for which we are attempting to secure a partner  we are likely to require additional capital and if additional capital is not raised our ability to continue as a going concern is in substantial doubt 
since our inception in  we have generated significant losses from operations and we anticipate that we will continue to generate significant losses from operations for the foreseeable future 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
our net loss was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our cash outlays from operations and capital expenditures were million for our stockholders equity decreased from million as of december  to a stockholders deficit of million as of december  we have also made substantial debt payments to elan and have commitments to make additional payments during we have limited capital resources and operations to date have been funded with the proceeds from collaborative research agreements  public and private equity and debt financings and income earned on investments 
these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the audit report prepared by our independent registered public accounting firm relating to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  includes an explanatory paragraph expressing the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources  without implementing cost reductions  raising additional capital  or obtaining substantial cash inflows from potential partners for our products  will enable us to continue operations through the end of the second quarter of should we be unable to raise needed capital by april  we have developed a plan whereby we would significantly decrease operating costs by reducing our workforce and scaling back research and development efforts 
these decreases would allow us to continue to operate through december  however  if our restructuring efforts as discussed herein are not sufficient due to unanticipated costs and expenses  we may be required to discontinue  shutdown  or cease operations 
this may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital 
if additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders 
in  we entered into a joint venture with elan to develop oral heparin 
in connection with the re purchase of elan s joint venture interest in  we issued a zero coupon note the original elan note to elan 
the original elan note had an issue price of million and an original issue discount at maturity of  and a maturity date of july  on december   we entered into a security purchase agreement the security purchase agreement with elan  providing for our purchase of our indebtedness to elan under the original elan note 
the value of the original elan note plus accrued interest on december  was approximately million 
pursuant to the security purchase agreement  we paid elan million and issued to elan  shares of our common stock with a market value of approximately million 
also  we issued to elan a new zero coupon note with an issue price of approximately million the modified elan note  representing the accrued value of the original elan note minus the sum of the cash payment and the value of the  shares 
under the security purchase agreement  we have the right to make a cash payment of million and issue  shares on april  and a final cash payment of million and the issuance of  shares of our common stock on june  in exchange for the remaining balance of the modified elan note 
alternatively  prior to march   we have the right to make a cash payment of million  and issue to elan a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock with an exercise price equal to the volume weighted average price for our common stock for the period of twenty consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the date of issuance of such warrant in exchange for the modified elan note 
we may also defer the cash payments and the common stock issuances to a date not later than september  if we exercise that right and elect to defer the million installment due on april   we are required to issue to elan an adjusted modified note the adjusted note equal to the outstanding balance of the modified elan note plus approximately million the value of the  shares issued on december  in exchange for the modified elan note and we will be obligated to pay elan  per month for each month during which the adjusted note remains outstanding 
if we do not complete the payments and the common stock issuances by september   we will be obligated to continue the payment of  per month until the full repayment of the adjusted note any time between september  and the maturity date of the original elan note july  
on december  we issued a million convertible note the novartis note to novartis in connection with a new research collaboration option relating to the development of pth the novartis note bears interest at a rate of prior to december   from december  through december   and from that point until maturity on december  we have the option to pay interest in cash on a current basis or accrue the periodic interest as an addition to the principal amount of the novartis note 
we may convert the novartis note at any time prior to maturity into a number of shares of our common stock equal to the principal and accrued and unpaid interest to be converted divided by the then market price of our common stock  provided certain conditions are met  including that the number of shares issued to novartis  when issued  does not exceed of the total shares of company common stock outstanding  that at the time of such conversion no event of default under the note has occurred and is continuing  and that there is either an effective shelf registration statement in effect covering the resale of the shares issued in connection with such conversion or the shares may be resold by novartis pursuant to sec rule k 
under the novartis note  an event of default shall be deemed to have occurred if we default on the payment of the principal amount of  and accrued and unpaid interest on  the novartis note upon maturity  we suffer a bankruptcy or similar insolvency event or proceeding  we materially breach a representation or warranty  we fail to timely cure a default in the payment of any other indebtedness in excess of a certain material threshold  or there occurs an acceleration of indebtedness in excess of that threshold  we suffer and do not discharge in a timely manner a final judgment for the payment of a sum in excess of a certain material threshold  we become entitled to terminate the registration of our securities or the filing of reports under the securities exchange act of  our common stock will be delisted from nasdaq  we experience a change of control including by  among other things  a change in the composition of a majority of our board other than as approved by the board in any one year period  a merger which results in our stockholders holding shares that represent less than a majority of the voting power of the merged entity  and any other acquisition by a third party of shares that represent a majority of the voting power of the company  we sell substantially all of our assets  or we are effectively unable to honor or perform our obligations under the new research collaboration option relating to the development of pth upon the occurrence of any such event of default prior to conversion  any unpaid principal and accrued interest on the novartis note would become immediately due and payable 
if the novartis note is converted into our common stock  novartis would have the right to require us to repurchase the shares of common stock within six months after an event of default under the novartis note  for an aggregate purchase price equal to the principal and interest that was converted  plus interest from the date of conversion  as if no conversion had occurred 
if we are unable to generate sufficient revenue from potential partners or raise additional capital  we will be required to curtail our development efforts  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to realize the commercial potential of our products 
if we fail to generate sufficient revenue or raise additional capital  we will have to undergo further restructuring and downsize our operations 
under those circumstances  our failure to restructure would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern 
historically  we have been able to implement cost reductions when necessary 
in may  we announced a plan for restructuring our operations  which included the discontinuation of our liquid oral heparin program and related initiatives  and a reduction of associated infrastructure 
in the third quarter of  we decided to dispose of our farmington  connecticut research facility 
these actions reduced our full time work force by approximately 
if our current funding and any proceeds of sales of shares of common stock to kingsbridge  if any  are not sufficient for our operations or our common stock purchase agreement with kingsbridge terminates  we may be required to restructure and reduce spending 
the resultant curtailment of our development efforts could have a material adverse effect on our ability to realize the commercial potential of our products and achieve long term profitability 
we are highly dependent on the clinical success of our oral heparin and insulin product candidates 
oral heparin and oral insulin are our two lead programs and are among our most advanced programs 
to date  we have invested million and million  in oral heparin and oral insulin  respectively 
we believe that  based on market size  these two products  if approved  could represent our largest sources of revenue 
if we fail to obtain regulatory approval for either of these products  either solely through our own efforts or through collaborations with one or more major pharmaceutical companies  our ability to fund future operations from operating revenue or issuance of additional equity is likely to be adversely affected 
we are not dependent on successful culmination of clinical trials or regulatory approval of any particular one of our other product candidate programs because our investment in each such program and reward upon successful completion of each such program is substantially less significant to our long term viability 
oral heparin heparin delivery is a highly competitive area 
other companies currently are developing spray buccal or alternate forms of heparin and other anti thrombotics have recently received european approval eg  astrazeneca s exanta 
we are developing solid dosage forms of oral heparin and have commenced phase iii testing for the snac heparin molecule combination 
we previously developed a liquid form of oral heparin and in conducted a phase iii clinical trial that was completed in early the trial did not meet its endpoint of superiority to lovenox  a leading low molecular weight heparin 
we believe that the trial failed to meet its endpoint of superiority possibly due in part to the poor taste of the liquid formulation 
we subsequently restructured our operations  which included the discontinuation of our liquid oral heparin program and related initiatives  and a reduction of associated infrastructure 
the resulting restructuring charge to earnings was approximately million 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in connection with the restructuring  we performed an evaluation of certain intangible and fixed assets to determine if their carrying amount exceeded their fair value 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million 
in  we recorded an additional impairment charge of million 
we cannot assure you that competitive heparin products will not have an adverse effect on our heparin product development efforts or that future clinical trials related to our solid form of oral heparin will meet targeted endpoints 
if future clinical trials related to oral heparin fail to meet the targeted endpoints  we likely would discontinue our oral heparin program and write off any remaining oral heparin investment 
in  we formed a joint venture with elan to develop oral forms of heparin 
in july  we reacquired all product  marketing and technology rights for our heparin products from elan 
in accordance with the termination agreement with elan  we will be required to pay elan royalties on our sales of oral heparin  subject to an annual cap of million 
oral insulin insulin delivery is a highly competitive area 
other companies currently are developing buccal or aerosol pulmonary forms of insulin eg  aventis pfizer nektar s exubera 
our oral insulin product candidate has demonstrated favorable data in early patient studies in both type and type diabetics 
however  we cannot assure you that future clinical trials related to our oral insulin will meet targeted endpoints  with the result that we may fail to obtain the necessary regulatory approval for sale of oral insulin  either alone or in collaboration with a major pharmaceutical company 
if such circumstances were to occur  we likely would discontinue our oral insulin program and write off any remaining oral insulin investment 
we are highly dependent upon collaborative partners to develop and commercialize compounds using our delivery agents 
a key part of our strategy is to form collaborations with pharmaceutical companies that will assist us in developing  testing  obtaining government approval for and commercializing oral forms of therapeutic macromolecules using the eligen technology 
we have collaborative agreements for candidates in clinical development with novartis and roche  and as noted below  we are in litigation with lilly and have given lilly notice of termination of our agreements 
we negotiate specific ownership rights with respect to the intellectual property developed as a result of the collaboration with each partner 
while ownership rights vary from program to program  in general we retain ownership rights to developments relating to our carrier and the collaborator retains rights related to the drug product developed 
despite our existing agreements  we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into additional collaborative arrangements to develop products utilizing our drug delivery technology  any existing or future collaborative arrangements will be sustainable or successful  the product candidates in collaborative arrangements will be further developed by partners in a timely fashion  any collaborative partner will not infringe upon our intellectual property position in violation of the terms of the collaboration contract  or milestones in collaborative agreements will be met and milestone payments will be received 
if we are unable to obtain development assistance and funds from other pharmaceutical companies to fund a portion of our product development costs and to commercialize our product candidates  we may be unable to issue equity upon favorable terms to allow us to raise sufficient capital to fund clinical development of our product candidates 
lack of funding would cause us to delay  scale back or curtail clinical development of one or more of our projects 
the determination of the specific project to curtail would depend upon the relative future economic value to us of each program 
our collaborative partners control the clinical development of the drug candidates and may terminate their efforts at will 
novartis controls the clinical development of oral calcitonin and oral rhgh 
pending the results of our litigation with lilly  novartis also has an option to control the clinical development of oral pth 
roche controls the clinical development of the small molecule compound for which they have licensed our technology 
although we influence the clinical program through participation on a steering committee for each product  novartis and roche control the decision making for the design and timing of their respective clinical studies 
as noted below  we are in litigation with lilly and have given lilly notice of termination of our agreements 
moreover  the agreements with novartis and roche provide that each may terminate its programs at will for any reason and without any financial penalty or requirement to fund any further clinical studies 
we cannot assure you that novartis or roche will continue to advance the clinical development of the drug candidates subject to collaboration 
our collaborative partners are free to develop competing products 
aside from provisions preventing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property by our collaborative partners  there is nothing in our collaborative agreements that prevents our partners from developing competing products 
if one of our partners were to develop a competing product  our collaboration could be substantially jeopardized 
we are currently in litigation with one of our collaborative partners  and an adverse determination of our patent infringement claims in that case could limit our future ability to realize on the potential value of those patents 
there is currently pending in the united states district court for the southern district of indiana  indianapolis division  a lawsuit with eli lilly and company 
the suit results from a notice that we delivered to lilly declaring that lilly was in material breach of certain research and collaboration agreements entered into with lilly with respect to the development of oral formulations of recombinant parathyroid hormone  pth following receipt of the notice  lilly filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment declaring that lilly is not in breach of its agreements with us concerning oral formulations of recombinant parathyroid hormone  pth  and an order preliminarily and permanently enjoining us from terminating those agreements 
on february   we served lilly with an amended counterclaim  alleging that lilly filed certain patent applications relating to the use of our proprietary technology in combination with another drug  in violation of our agreements with lilly  and that the activities disclosed in such applications infringe upon our patents 
we are also alleging that lilly has breached the agreements by failing to make a milestone payment of million  as required upon the completion of oral pth product phase i studies 
lilly has denied that the million currently is due on the basis that the requisite phase i studies have not been completed and that the patent applications that it filed relating to the use of our proprietary technology in combination with another drug is not in violation of our agreements with lilly  and that the activities disclosed in such applications do not infringe upon our patents 
on february   the court entered a case management plan and the parties commenced the exchange of discovery materials in march by notice dated august   we notified lilly that in light of lilly s ongoing  repeated and uncured violations of its pth license agreement  both its agreements with us were terminated 
thereafter  lilly amended its complaint to seek a declaration that we are not entitled to terminate those agreements and also to seek declarations that lilly has not infringed our patents 
the case went to trial on january  the trial lasted days and closing arguments were heard on february  an adverse determination in this litigation concerning our claim that lilly has infringed upon our patents could limit our future ability to realize on the potential value of those patents 
although the costs of litigating this matter may be material  we anticipate that we will have sufficient financial resources to fund future costs and we do not anticipate any significant impact on our ability to develop our product candidates 
through december   we have incurred approximately million in expenses relating to this litigation 
although we are not currently involved in litigation with any of our other collaborative partners and have no reason to believe that such litigation will arise  it is possible that in the future this may not be the case 
were we to become involved in litigation with another of our collaborative partners  we would bear the additional expense of the litigation and we would likely suffer an adverse impact on both the program covered by the collaborative agreement and our relationship with the particular collaborative partner 
our product candidates are in various stages of development  and we cannot be certain that any will be suitable for commercial purposes 
to be profitable  we must successfully research  develop  obtain regulatory approval for  manufacture  introduce  market and distribute our products under development  or secure a partner to provide financial and other assistance with these steps 
the time necessary to achieve these goals for any individual product is long and uncertain 
before we or a potential partner can sell any of our products under development  we must demonstrate through preclinical animal studies and clinical human trials that each product is safe and effective for human use for each targeted indication 
we cannot be certain that we or our current or future partners will be able to begin  or continue  planned clinical trials for our product candidates  or if we are able  that the product candidates will prove to be safe and will produce their intended effects 
a number of companies in the drug delivery  biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials  even after showing promising results in earlier studies or trials 
we cannot assure you that favorable results in any preclinical study or early clinical trial will mean that favorable results will ultimately be obtained in future clinical trials 
nor can we assure you that results of limited animal and human studies are indicative of results that would be achieved in future animal studies or human clinical studies  all or some of which will be required in order to have our product candidates obtain regulatory approval 
similarly  we cannot assure you that any of our product candidates will be approved by the fda 
for example  we initially set out to develop a liquid formulation of oral heparin 
at the end of  we initiated a phase iii study of our oral heparin liquid formulation 
the multi center  double blind  double dummy phase iii trial was referred to as the protect trial prophylaxis with oral snac heparin against thromboembolic complications following total hip replacement surgery 
we enrolled  patients in our protect trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a solution oral heparin formulation using our eligen oral drug delivery technology for the prevention of dvt in total hip replacement surgery patients a surgical patient population that historically has had a high rate of dvt 
the goal of the protect trial was to demonstrate the superior efficacy and comparable safety of our oral heparin when dosed postoperatively for a day regimen  as compared to injectable enoxaparin  when dosed postoperatively for a day regimen 
a day regimen of injectable enoxaparin  marketed by aventis pharma sa under the lovenox trademark  is the standard of care in the prevention of dvt  as determined by the american college of chest physicians sixth consensus conference 
the endpoint of the protect trial was dvt occurrence in the days following surgery  or pulmonary embolism or death 
investigators at more than international sites evaluated a liquid form of heparin  consisting of the emisphere delivery agent  snac sodium n 
hydroxybenzoyl amino caprylate  in combination with unfractionated heparin  when dosed orally in a day regimen  compared to enoxaparin  when dosed subcutaneously by injection in a day regimen 
total dvts were determined by bilateral venogram  the fda standard for measurement  measured at days following surgery 
a team of radiologists at boston s massachusetts general hospital read all the venographies produced to determine the presence of a blood clot thrombus 
on may   we announced initial results from the protect study 
those initial results did not demonstrate the superiority of oral heparin  when dosed in a day treatment regimen  compared to enoxaparin administered by injection in a day dosing regimen in preventing dvts 
unless the clinical data has utility in other development programs or the safety data from the protect trial is deemed useable  the termination of clinical trials for a product candidate may result in a loss of our cumulative investment in the product candidate 
these expenses are primarily costs of engaging clinical contract research organization and production of clinical supplies of the drug candidate 
our future business success depends heavily upon regulatory approvals  which can be difficult to obtain for a variety of reasons  including cost 
our preclinical studies and clinical trials  as well as the manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates  are subject to extensive  costly and rigorous regulation by various governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
the process of obtaining required approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities often takes many years  is expensive and can vary significantly based on the type  complexity and novelty of the product candidates 
we cannot assure you that we  either independently or in collaboration with others  will meet the applicable regulatory criteria in order to receive the required approvals for manufacturing and marketing 
delays in obtaining united states or foreign approvals for our self developed projects could result in substantial additional costs to us  and  therefore  could adversely affect our ability to compete with other companies 
additionally  delays in obtaining regulatory approvals encountered by others with whom we collaborate also could adversely affect our business and prospects 
even if regulatory approval of a product is obtained  the approval may place limitations on the intended uses of the product  and may restrict the way in which we or our partner may market the product 
the regulatory approval process presents several risks to us in general  preclinical tests and clinical trials can take many years  and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
the data obtained from these tests and trials can be susceptible to varying interpretation that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
delays or rejections may be encountered during any stage of the regulatory process based upon the failure of the clinical or other data to demonstrate compliance with  or upon the failure of the product to meet  a regulatory agency s requirements for safety  efficacy and quality or  in the case of a product seeking an orphan drug indication  because another designee received approval first 
requirements for approval may become more stringent due to changes in regulatory agency policy  or the adoption of new regulations or legislation 
the scope of any regulatory approval  when obtained  may significantly limit the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed and may impose significant limitations in the nature of warnings  precautions and contraindications that could materially affect the profitability of the drug 
approved drugs  as well as their manufacturers  are subject to continuing and on going review  and discovery of previously unknown problems with these products or the failure to adhere to manufacturing or quality control requirements may result in restrictions on their manufacture  sale or use or in their withdrawal from the market 
regulatory authorities and agencies may promulgate additional regulations restricting the sale of our existing and proposed products 
once a product receives marketing approval  the fda may not permit us to market that product for broader or different applications  or may not grant us clearance with respect to separate product applications that represent extensions of our basic technology 
in addition  the fda may withdraw or modify existing clearances in a significant manner or promulgate additional regulations restricting the sale of our present or proposed products 
additionally  we face the risk that our competitors may gain fda approval for a product before us 
having a competitor reach the market before us would impede the future commercial success for our competing product because we believe that the fda uses heightened standards of approval for products once approval has been granted to a competing product in a particular product area 
we believe that this standard generally limits new approvals to only those products that meet or exceed the standards set by the previously approved product 
we may not be able to sell our farmington facility 
in the third quarter of  we decided to dispose of our farmington  connecticut research facility 
we do not currently have a purchaser for this facility and we cannot be certain of when or if we will consummate a sale of the facility 
a previously interested purchaser has terminated its interest in the facility and we may not find an alternate buyer 
in january  an adjoining landowner filed a notice of pendency on the property claiming certain rights under a right of way  and in addition filed suit in a matter captioned farmington avenue baptist church  plaintiff  vs 
farm tech corporation  defendant  superior court of the state of connecticut  judicial district of hartford 
depositions of the pastor and the attorney for the adjoining landowner have been completed 
this litigation is ongoing and may have an adverse effect on our ability to sell the facility 
the sale of the farmington facility may not occur in the near future and the costs associated with the facility eg  utilities  insurance  maintenance and real estate taxes will require continued cash outlays 
the carrying value of the farmington facility as of december  was million 
our business will suffer if we cannot adequately protect our patent and proprietary rights 
although we have patents for some of our product candidates and have applied for additional patents  there can be no assurance that patents applied for will be granted  that patents granted to or acquired by us now or in the future will be valid and enforceable and provide us with meaningful protection from competition or that we will possess the financial resources necessary to enforce any of our patents 
also  we cannot be certain that any products that we or a licensee develop will not infringe upon any patent or other intellectual property right of a third party 
we also rely upon trade secrets  know how and continuing technological advances to develop and maintain our competitive position 
we maintain a policy of requiring employees  scientific advisors  consultants and collaborators to execute confidentiality and invention assignment agreements upon commencement of a relationship with us 
we cannot assure you that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information 
part of our strategy involves collaborative arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies for the development of new formulations of drugs developed by others and  ultimately  the receipt of royalties on sales of the new formulations of those drugs 
these drugs are generally the property of the pharmaceutical companies and may be the subject of patents or patent applications and other rights of protection owned by the pharmaceutical companies 
to the extent those patents or other forms of rights expire  become invalid or otherwise ineffective  or to the extent those drugs are covered by patents or other forms of protection owned by third parties  sales of those drugs by the collaborating pharmaceutical company may be restricted  limited  enjoined  or may cease 
accordingly  the potential for royalty revenues to us may be adversely affected 
we may be at risk of having to obtain a license from third parties making proprietary improvements to our technology 
there is a possibility that third parties may make improvements or innovations to our technology in a more expeditious manner than we do 
although we are not aware of any such circumstance related to our product portfolio  should such circumstances arise  we may need to obtain a license from such third party to obtain the benefit of the improvement or innovation 
royalties payable under such a license would reduce our share of total revenue 
such a license may not be available to us at all or on commercially reasonable terms 
although we currently do not know of any circumstances related to our product portfolio which would lead us to believe that a third party has developed any improvements or innovation with respect to our technology  we cannot assure you that such circumstances will not arise in the future 
we cannot reasonably determine the cost to us of the effect of being unable to obtain any such license 
we are dependent on third parties to manufacture and  in some cases  test our products 
we have a facility to manufacture a limited quantity of clinical supplies containing emisphere delivery agents 
currently  we have no manufacturing facilities for production of any therapeutic compounds under consideration as products 
we have no facilities for clinical testing 
the success of our self developed programs is dependent upon securing manufacturing capabilities and contracting with clinical service providers 
the availability of manufacturers is limited by both the capacity of such manufacturers and their regulatory compliance 
among the conditions for nda approval is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer s quality control and manufacturing procedures continually conform with the fda s current gmp gmp are regulations established by the fda that govern the manufacture  processing  packing  storage and testing of drugs intended for human use 
in complying with gmp  manufacturers must devote extensive time  money and effort in the area of production and quality control and quality assurance to maintain full technical compliance 
manufacturing facilities and company records are subject to periodic inspections by the fda to ensure compliance 
if a manufacturing facility is not in substantial compliance with these requirements  regulatory enforcement action may be taken by the fda  which may include seeking an injunction against shipment of products from the facility and recall of products previously shipped from the facility 
such actions could severely delay our ability to obtain product from that particular source 
the success of our clinical trials and our partnerships is dependent on the proposed or current partner s capacity and ability to adequately manufacture drug products to meet the proposed demand of each respective market 
although any significant delay in obtaining a supply source which could result from  for example  an fda determination that such manufacturer does not comply with current gmp could harm our potential for success 
additionally  if a current manufacturer were to lose its ability to meet our supply demands during a clinical trial  the trial may be delayed or may even need to be abandoned 
we may face product liability claims related to participation in clinical trials or future products 
we have product liability insurance with a policy limit of million per occurrence and in the aggregate 
the testing  manufacture and marketing of products for humans utilizing our drug delivery technology may expose us to potential product liability and other claims 
these may be claims directly by consumers or by pharmaceutical companies or others selling our future products 
we seek to structure development programs with pharmaceutical companies that would complete the development  manufacturing and marketing of the finished product in a manner that would protect us from such liability  but the indemnity undertakings for product liability claims that we secure from the pharmaceutical companies may prove to be insufficient 
we are subject to environmental  health and safety laws and regulations for which we incur costs to comply 
we use some hazardous materials in our research and development activities and are subject to environmental  health and safety laws and regulations governing the use of such materials 
for example  our operations involve the controlled use of chemicals  biologicals and radioactive materials and we bear the costs of complying with the various regulations governing the use of such materials 
costs of compliance have not been material to date 
while we believe we are currently in compliance with the federal  state and local laws governing the use of such materials  we cannot be certain that accidental injury or contamination will not occur 
should we be held liable or face regulatory actions regarding an accident involving personal injury or an environmental release  we potentially could incur costs in excess of our resources or insurance coverage  although  to date  we have not had to deal with any such actions 
during each of  and  we incurred costs of approximately thousand in our compliance with environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
we face rapid technological change and intense competition 
our success depends  in part  upon maintaining a competitive position in the development of products and technologies in an evolving field in which developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace 
we compete with other drug delivery  biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  research organizations  individual scientists and non profit organizations engaged in the development of alternative drug delivery technologies or new drug research and testing  as well as with entities developing new drugs that may be orally active 
many of these competitors have greater research and development capabilities  experience  and marketing  financial and managerial resources than we have  and  therefore  represent significant competition 
our products  when developed and marketed  may compete with existing parenteral or other versions of the same drug  some of which are well established in the marketplace and manufactured by formidable competitors  as well as other existing drugs 
for example  our oral heparin product candidate  if successful  would compete with intravenous heparin  injectable low molecular weight heparin and oral warfarin  as well as the recently approved injectable pentasaccharide and oral melagatran products 
these products are marketed throughout the world by leading pharmaceutical companies such as aventis pharma sa  pfizer  inc and bristol myers squibb company 
similarly  our salmon calcitonin product candidate  if developed and marketed  would compete with a wide array of existing osteoporosis therapies  including a nasal dosage form of salmon calcitonin  estrogen replacement therapy  selective estrogen receptor modulators  bisphosphonates and other compounds in development 
our competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies or obtaining government approval for products before we do 
developments by others may render our product candidates  or the therapeutic macromolecules used in combination with our product candidates  noncompetitive or obsolete 
for example  nobex corporation has an oral insulin formulation being developed and at least one competitor has notified the fda that it is developing a competing formulation of salmon calcitonin 
we cannot assure you that  if our products are marketed  they will be preferred to existing drugs or that they will be preferred to or available before other products in development 
if a competitor announces a successful clinical study involving a product that may be competitive with one of our product candidates or an approval by a regulatory agency of the marketing of a competitive product  such announcement may have a material adverse effect on our operations or future prospects resulting from reduced sales of future products that we may wish to bring to market or from an adverse impact on the price of our common stock or our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates 
we are dependent on our key personnel and if we cannot recruit and retain leaders in our research  development  manufacturing  and commercial organizations  our business will be harmed 
we are highly dependent on our executive officers 
our chairman and ceo  michael goldberg  md  has been with emisphere for fourteen years 
we would be significantly disadvantaged if dr 
goldberg were to leave emisphere 
the loss of other officers could have an adverse effect as well  given their specific knowledge related to our proprietary technology and personal relationships with our pharmaceutical company partners 
if we are not able to retain our executive officers  our business may suffer 
none of our key officers are nearing retirement age or have announced any intention to leave emisphere 
we have an employment contract with dr 
goldberg that extends through august of we do not maintain key man life insurance policies for any of our executive officers 
there is intense competition in the biotechnology industry for qualified scientists and managerial personnel in the development  manufacture  and commercialization of drugs 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for developing our business 
additionally  because of the knowledge and experience of our scientific personnel and their specific knowledge with respect to our drug carriers the continued development of our product candidates could be adversely affected by the loss of any significant number of such personnel 
provisions of our corporate charter documents  delaware law and our stockholder rights plan may dissuade potential acquirors  prevent the replacement or removal of our current management and may thereby affect the price of our common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
of these  shares   are currently designated series a junior participating cumulative preferred stock a preferred stock in connection with our stockholder rights plan  and the remaining  shares remain available for future issuance 
rights of holders of common stock may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
we also have a stockholder rights plan  commonly referred to as a poison pill  in which preferred stock purchase rights the rights have been granted at the rate of one one hundredth of a share of a preferred stock at an exercise price of for each share of our common stock 
the rights are not exercisable or transferable apart from the common stock  until the earlier of i ten days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons have acquired beneficial ownership of or more of our outstanding common stock or ii ten business days or such later date  as defined following the commencement of  or announcement of an intention to make a tender offer or exchange offer  the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person  or group  of or more of our outstanding common stock 
if we enter into consolidation  merger  or other business combinations  as defined  each right would entitle the holder upon exercise to receive  in lieu of shares of a preferred stock  a number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company having a value of two times the exercise price of the right  as defined 
by potentially diluting the ownership of the acquiring company  our rights plan may dissuade prospective acquirors of our company 
the a preferred stockholders will be entitled to a preferential cumulative quarterly dividend of the greater of per share or times the per share dividend declared on our stock and are also entitled to a liquidation preference  thereby hindering an acquiror s ability to freely pay dividends or to liquidate the company following an acquisition 
each a preferred stock share will have votes and will vote together with the common shares  effectively preventing an acquiror from removing existing management 
the rights contain anti dilutive provisions  are redeemable at our option  subject to certain defined restrictions for 
per right  and expire on february  additional provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting common stock 
these include provisions that classify our board of directors  limit the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent  call special meetings  remove a director for cause  amend the by laws or approve a merger with another company 
we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law which prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
for purposes of section  a business combination includes a merger  asset sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder  and an interested stockholder is a person who  either alone or together with affiliates and associates  owns or within the past three years  did own or more of the corporation s voting stock 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile 
the trading price for our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
the market prices for securities of drug delivery  biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have historically been highly volatile 
factors that could adversely affect our stock price include fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of partnerships or technological collaborations  innovations or new products by us or our competitors  governmental regulation  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety of drugs developed by us or others  the results of preclinical testing and clinical studies or trials by us  our partners or our competitors  litigation  general stock market and economic conditions  number of shares available for trading float  inclusion in or dropping from stock indexes 
as of december   our week high and low closing market price for our common stock was and  respectively 
future sales of common stock or warrants  or the prospect of future sales  may depress our stock price 
sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock or warrants  or the perception that sales could occur  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
as of december   there were outstanding options to purchase up to  shares of our common stock that are currently exercisable  and additional outstanding options to purchase up to  shares of common stock that are exercisable over the next several years 
the holders of these options have an opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock with a resulting dilution in the interests of the other 
the existence of these options may adversely affect the terms on which we may be able to obtain additional financing 
in connection with the common stock purchase agreement with kingsbridge described above  we entered into a registration rights agreement with kingsbridge the registration rights agreement 
under the terms of the registration rights agreement  we granted registration rights to kingsbridge concerning the resale by kingsbridge of the  shares of our common stock that may be purchased by kingsbridge pursuant to the warrant that was issued to kingsbridge on december  the registration rights agreement also grants registration rights to kingsbridge for up to million worth of common stock that we in our discretion choose to sell in the future to kingsbridge under the common stock purchase agreement 
the registration rights agreement requires us to file a registration statement concerning such shares of our common stock with the sec within sixty calendar days after december  we must use our commercially reasonable efforts to have the registration statement declared effective by the securities and exchange commission within one hundred twenty calendar days after december  in addition  currently   shares of our common stock and outstanding options to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock are subject to piggyback registration rights  at the option of the option holder  in the event we register any of our common stock for the account of any person other than emisphere other than a registration statement on form s or s or an offering to our existing security holders or pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan  or any other registration which is not appropriate for the registration of these particular options 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary investment objective is to preserve principal while maximizing yield without significantly increasing risk 
our investments consist of us mortgage backed securities  commercial paper  corporate notes and corporate equities 
our fixed rate interest bearing investments totaled million at december  of this total  million mature in less than one year and million mature in one to two years 
we have classified all investments as short term based on our intent to liquidate the investments to fund operations over the upcoming twelve month period 
due to the conservative nature of our short term fixed interest rate investments maturities in less than one year  we do not believe that they have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
the value of our fixed interest rate long term investments is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in a change in the fair value of these investments due to differences between the current market interest rate and the rate prevailing at the date of original purchase of the investment 
reasonably expected changes in prevailing interest rates would not materially impact the value of our long term investments
