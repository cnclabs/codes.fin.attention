the results of operations of a b bolt have been included in our operating results from the date of acquisition 
on december   t energy services  inc  a private delaware corporation former t  merged into ihi  a texas corporation  with ihi surviving the merger 
in connection with the merger  the combined company was reincorporated in delaware under the name t energy services  inc and implemented a one for ten reverse stock split of its common stock 
the merger was treated for accounting purposes as a purchase of ihi by former t a reverse acquisition in a purchase business transaction 
the purchase method of accounting requires that we carry forward former t s net assets at their historical book values and reflect ihi s net assets at their estimated fair market values  with the fair market value of the purchase consideration in excess of the fair market value of ihi s identifiable net assets treated as goodwill 
the historical financial data presented in this annual report on form k includes the historical financial condition and operating results of t prior to its merger with ihi 
for the year  the historical financial data also includes the two weeks of operations of the combined company from december  to december  as part of the merger with ihi  we acquired a non energy subsidiary 
because the subsidiary s operations were outside our strategic focus  at the time of the merger  we identified this operation as one to be sold 
the sale was completed in july on december   our shares of common stock began trading on the nasdaq national market under the new symbol ttes 
immediately after the merger  first reserve fund viii  lp first reserve owned approximately of our common shares  and collectively all of the former t stockholders including first reserve owned approximately of our common shares  with the remaining of our common shares being held by the stockholders of ihi immediately prior to the merger

table of contents combined company  and the management of former t and six of former t s director designees assumed the management and director duties for the combined company 
in mid year  we hired a new management team that undertook an in depth evaluation of our businesses and products with the purpose of maximizing stockholder value and positioning t for future growth 
during the fourth quarter of  we committed to a formal plan to sell certain non core assets within our products segment 
the sale of these assets was consummated in february the assets sold comprised substantially all of the assets of lss lone star houston inc  bolt manufacturing co  inc d b a walker bolt manufacturing company and whir acquisition  inc d b a ameritech manufacturing  collectively  the fastener businesses

pursuant to the asset sale agreement  the buyer purchased all of the assets of the fastener businesses for a purchase price of million  subject to a working capital adjustment after closing 
we received million in cash on february   which was immediately used to pay down our wells fargo term loan 
in addition  we received two promissory notes in the amount of million and million  respectively 
we did not record these two notes as their ultimate collection is contingent upon the occurrence of certain specified events which management believes are not probable of occurring 
at december   the assets held for sale constituted a business and thus were classified as discontinued operations 
goodwill was allocated based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit being disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit remaining 
for the year ended december   we recorded a loss of million  net of tax  based upon a pending sales contract 
included in this loss was a goodwill impairment charge of million and a long lived asset impairment of million 
in the fourth quarter of  our management completed its evaluation of each of our business segment s product lines and service revenues for expected future performance and developed a new strategy and operating plan 
management based its expectations for t s future performance on then current market conditions and on each of the business segment s potential to maximize the value of the overall business by either expansion or growth of product lines and services  internally and through acquisitions  and in both the domestic and international markets 
we reevaluated our expectations for the earnings  growth and contribution of the products segment for and concluded that the segment would continue to contribute positively to t s consolidated results of operations and cash flows but at a much reduced level 
this determination took into account the continued softness in the gulf of mexico upstream and downstream oil and gas industry as well as lower revenues generated from larger fabricated equipment and component sales 
in addition  we expected lower revenues from the electrical motor and generator repair and storage business 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million  of which million is attributable to the company s custom coatings business  during the fourth quarter of on goodwill attributable to our products segment 
during the second quarter of  we again reevaluated our expectations for the earnings  growth and contribution of the products segment 
as part of this reevaluation  we decided to sell substantially all of the remaining assets within our products segment  except for certain assets related to the company s custom coatings business  along with certain assets within our pressure control segment 
a portion of the remaining products segment assets were sold during may and june for million and million  respectively

at june   pressure control goodwill was allocated based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit being disposed and the portion of the reporting unit remaining 
this resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of million during the second quarter of  related to the assets being sold within our pressure control segment 
in addition to the goodwill impairment charge  we recorded a million charge to other intangible assets and a million charge to tangible assets related to the products and pressure control dispositions during the second quarter of during the second quarter of  we also sold certain assets of the spray weld division of o m equipment  lp for cash of million 
these assets did not constitute a business  however  they did qualify as assets held for sale 
accordingly  they are presented as such on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
the disposition of these assets resulted in a loss on sale of  which included a  write down of other intangible assets 
the results of operations are classified in income from continuing operations for the periods presented 
on september   we entered into loan agreements to refinance our senior and subordinated credit facilities with our existing lenders 
the proceeds from these credit facilities will be used to refinance debt  to finance acquisitions and for general corporate and working capital purposes

historical trends and outlook the following table sets forth certain statistics that are reflective of recent historical market conditions wti henry hub united states gulf of mexico canada year ended oil gas rig count rig count rig count december  december  december  source average price per barrel for the year calculated by t using daily data published by the united states department of energy on its website  www

demand for our products and services is cyclical and dependent upon activity in the oil and gas industry and the profitability  cash flow and willingness of oil and gas companies and drilling contractors to spend capital on the exploration  development and production of oil and gas reserves in the gulf of mexico and the united states gulf coast regions  where our products and services are primarily sold  and to a lesser degree  canada 
the level of exploration and production  especially in the gulf of mexico  is highly sensitive to current and projected oil and natural gas prices  which have historically been characterized by significant volatility 
over the last several years  the united states drilling rig count has fluctuated due to world economic and political trends that influence the supply and demand for energy  the price of oil and natural gas and the level of exploration and drilling 
the united states drilling rig count increased steadily throughout and however  the average gulf of mexico rig count remained at relatively low levels throughout before a further decline during  and the canadian rig count increased throughout but remained relatively flat during 
table of contents our revenue growth will continue to be heavily dependent upon the timing and strength of the recovery in the gulf of mexico market and our gains in market share outside the gulf of mexico 
the extent and timing of any recovery in the gulf of mexico market and gains in market share outside the gulf of mexico are not predictable 
as illustrated in the table above  the market price of oil and gas alone is not an indicator of a recovery in these markets 
many external factors  including world economic and political conditions  quotas established by opec organization of petroleum exporting countries and weather conditions  will influence the recovery and strength of the industry 
based on our assessment of external factors and our current levels of inquiry and quotation  we believe that activity levels will increase during results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating statement data for each of our segments for each of the years presented in thousands

principal debt instruments 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million borrowed under our senior credit facility and other bank financings 
as of december   as a result of the lesser of the leverage ratio covenant and the senior leverage ratio covenant  as defined in the credit agreement for our senior credit facility  our availability under our revolving credit facility was limited to million 
on september   we amended and restated our senior credit facility and subordinated term loan 
the amended and restated senior credit facility provides for a million revolving line of credit  maturing september   that we can increase by up to million not to exceed a total commitment of million 
the senior credit facility consists of a revolving credit facility that includes a swing line subfacility up to million and a letter of credit subfacility up to million 
we have capitalized million of deferred loan costs in connection with the amended and restated senior credit facility 
we intend to use the proceeds from any advances made pursuant to the senior credit facility to refinance indebtedness  for working capital purposes  capital expenditures  and to fund acquisitions 
the applicable interest rate of the senior credit facility is governed by our leverage ratio and ranges from prime plus or libor plus to prime plus or libor plus 
at december   the senior credit facility bore interest at  with interest payable quarterly 
we are required to prepay the senior credit facility under certain circumstances with the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales  insurance proceeds and equity issuances subject to certain conditions 
the senior credit facility provides  among other covenants and 
table of contents restrictions  that we comply with certain financial covenants  including a limitation on capital expenditures  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a minimum consolidated net worth  maximum leverage and senior leverage ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants under the senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
the senior credit facility s weighted average interest rate  including amortization of loan costs  for the year ended december  was  due primarily to the amount of the deferred loan costs amortization 
the weighted average interest rate  excluding amortization of deferred loan costs  was

the principal balance was due in full on december  we believe that cash generated from operations and amounts available under our amended and restated senior credit facility and from other sources of debt will be sufficient to fund existing operations  working capital needs  capital expenditure requirements and financing obligations 
we also believe any significant increase in capital expenditures caused by any need to increase manufacturing capacity can be funded from operations or through debt financing 
we intend to pursue additional acquisition candidates  but the timing  size or success of any acquisition effort and the related potential capital commitments cannot be predicted 
we expect to fund future cash acquisitions primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings  including the unborrowed portion of our senior credit facility or new debt issuances  but may also issue additional equity either directly or in connection with an acquisition 
however  there can be no assurance that acquisition funds will be available at terms acceptable to us

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation is based upon our consolidated financial statements 
we prepare these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we base our estimates on historical experience  available information and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this annual report on form k 
the accounting policies we believe are the most critical to our reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and estimates are described below 

table of contents accounts receivable accounts receivable are stated at the historical carrying amount  net of write offs and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our receivables are exposed to concentrations of credit risk since a majority of our business is conducted with companies in the oil and gas  petrochemical  chemical and petroleum refining industries in the gulf coast region and canada 
we continually monitor collections and evaluate the financial strength of our customers but do not require collateral to support our domestic customer receivables 
we may require collateral to support our international customer receivables  if any 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential collection issues in addition to reserves for specific accounts receivable where collection is no longer probable 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates we have in the past or that our losses will not exceed the amount reserved 
inventory we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and slow moving inventory to write down the recorded cost of inventory to its fair market value 
this analysis is based primarily on the length of time the item has remained in inventory and management s consideration of current and expected market conditions 
however  a significant decrease in demand and a further weakening of market conditions could result in further writedowns in inventory carrying values and charges to earnings 
long lived assets long lived assets to be held and used by us are reviewed to determine whether any events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
long lived assets include property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangibles 
for long lived assets to be held and used  we base our evaluation on impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets  any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions or factors that may be present 
if such impairment indicators are present or other factors exist that indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  we determine whether an impairment has occurred through the use of an undiscounted cash flows analysis of the asset at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
the undiscounted cash flow analysis consists of estimating the future cash flows that are directly associated with and expected to arise from the use and eventual disposition of the asset over its remaining useful life 
these cash flows are inherently subjective and require significant estimates based upon historical experience and future expectations such as budgets and internal projections 
if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the long lived asset  an impairment has occurred  and we recognize a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the asset 
the fair value of the asset is measured using quoted market prices or  in the absence of quoted market prices  is based on an estimate of discounted cash flows 
for the years ended december   and  no significant impairment has occurred for assets of continuing operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses and represents a significant portion of our assets 
identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based upon fair market value at the date of acquisition 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this standard changes the accounting for goodwill and certain other intangible assets from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
the standard also requires a reassessment of the useful lives of identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill and at least an annual test for impairment of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives 
during  we completed the transitional goodwill and indefinite life intangibles impairment tests as well as the annual impairment tests required by sfas no 
during  our calculations indicated the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount and  accordingly  goodwill and indefinite life intangibles were not impaired 
our annual tests of impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles are performed as of december 
table of contents the fair values of our reporting units were determined based on the reporting units projected discounted cash flow and publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples of comparable businesses 
in mid year  we hired a new management team that undertook an in depth evaluation of our businesses and products with the purpose of maximizing stockholder value and positioning t for future growth 
in the fourth quarter of  our management completed its evaluation of each of our business segment s product lines and service revenues for expected future performance and developed a new strategy and operating plan 
management based its expectations for t s future performance on then current market conditions and on each of the business segment s potential to maximize the value of the overall business by either expansion or growth of product lines and services  internally and through acquisitions  and in both the domestic and international markets 
during the fourth quarter of  we committed to a formal plan to sell certain non core assets within our products segment 
at december   the assets held for sale constituted a business and thus were classified as discontinued operations 
goodwill was allocated based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit being disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit remaining 
for the year ended december   we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million related to these assets being disposed of 
in connection with the disposition of these certain non core assets  we reevaluated our expectations for the earnings  growth and contribution of the products segment for and concluded that the segment would continue to contribute positively to t s consolidated results of operations and cash flows but at a much reduced level 
this determination took into account continued softness in the gulf of mexico upstream and downstream oil and gas industry as well as lower revenues generated from larger fabricated equipment and component sales 
in addition  we expected lower revenues from the electrical motor and generator repair and storage business 
accordingly  at december   we assessed the realizability of the company s recorded goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with sfas no 
our analysis indicated that goodwill was impaired for the remaining businesses within the products segment as their carrying value was greater than fair value 
we then performed a discounted cash flow analysis and used other market methods to estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill and intangibles 
this assessment indicated that goodwill of million  of which million is attributable to the company s custom coatings business  was impaired 
during the second quarter of  we again reevaluated our expectations for the earnings  growth and contribution of the products segment 
as part of this reevaluation  we decided to sell substantially all of the remaining assets within our products segment  except for certain assets related to the company s custom coatings business  along with certain assets within our pressure control segment 
thus  at june   pressure control goodwill was allocated based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit being disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit remaining 
this resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of million in discontinued operations during the second quarter of  related to the assets being sold within our pressure control segment 
due to the sale of substantially all of the assets of our products segment and since our custom coatings business is insignificant to the consolidated results of our company and also has similar economic characteristics  customers and products to our pressure control segment  we realigned our operating segments during june the three historical reporting segments of pressure control  products and distribution now operate under two reporting segments pressure control and distribution 
accordingly  all historical segment results reflect the new operating structure 
at december   we completed the annual impairment test required by sfas no 
our calculations indicated the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount and  accordingly  goodwill and indefinite life intangibles were not impaired 
the fair values of our reporting units were determined based on the reporting units projected discounted cash flow and publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples of comparable businesses 
certain estimates and judgments are required in our fair value calculations 
we have determined no impairment exists  however  if for any reason the fair value of our goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets declines below the carrying value in the future  we may incur charges for the impairment 
we will 
table of contents continue to test on a consistent measurement date unless events occur or circumstances change between annual impairment tests that would more likely than not reduce fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
self insurance we are self insured up to certain levels for our group medical coverage 
the amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured  up to a limit 
liabilities associated with these risks are estimated by considering historical claims experience 
although we believe adequate reserves have been provided for expected liabilities arising from our self insured obligations  projections of future losses are inherently uncertain  and it is possible that our estimates of these liabilities will change over the near term as circumstances develop 
income taxes we provide for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this standard takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
our effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
we operate in a number of domestic tax jurisdictions and certain foreign tax jurisdictions under various legal forms 
as a result  we are subject to domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions and tax agreements and treaties among the various taxing authorities 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will expire before realization of the benefit or that future deductibility is not probable 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends upon the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the future 
this requires us to use estimates and make assumptions regarding significant future events such as the taxability of entities operating in the various taxing jurisdictions 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all reasonably available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income 
in estimating future taxable income  we develop assumptions  including the amount of future state  federal and international pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment 
when the likelihood of the realization of existing deferred tax assets changes  adjustments to the valuation allowance are charged  in the period in which the determination is made  either to income or goodwill  depending upon when that portion of the valuation allowance was originally created 
in addition  we have identified various domestic and international tax planning strategies we would implement  if necessary  to enable the realization of our deferred tax assets 
as of december   our net deferred tax assets were million excluding a related valuation allowance of million 
as of december   our net deferred tax assets were million excluding a related valuation allowance of million 
in  we recorded a net reduction of million to our valuation allowance 
this reduction is the result of a million decrease in the valuation allowance to recognize a federal deferred tax asset to the extent of federal net deferred tax liabilities  partially offset by an increase in net operating loss carryforwards 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse the risks and rewards of ownership among their owners and other parties involved 
the provisions of interpretation no 
are applicable immediately to all variable interest entities created 
table of contents after january  and require certain disclosures for all variable interest entities 
in december  the fasb published a revision to fin fin r to clarify some of the provisions of the interpretation and to defer the effective date of implementation for certain entities created before january  under the guidance of fin r  entities that do not have interests in structures that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities are required to apply the provisions of the interpretation in financial statements for periods ending after march  the adoption of fin and fin r did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb  chapter 
sfas clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
this statement requires that abnormal amounts be recognized as current period charges in all circumstances 
in addition  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe the implementation of sfas will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
generally  the approach to accounting for share based payments in sfas r  is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
sfas r is effective at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact this will have  but do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp and fasb staff position no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp 
fsp clarifies the guidance in sfas no 
and provides that the new deduction for qualified domestic production activities under the american jobs creation act of the act should be accounted for as a special deduction under sfas  not as a tax rate reduction  because the deduction is contingent on performing activities identified in the act 
fsp addresses the effect of the act s one time deduction for qualifying repatriations of foreign earnings 
fsp allows additional time for companies to determine whether any foreign earnings will be repatriated under the act s one time deduction for repatriated earnings and how the act affects whether undistributed earnings continue to qualify for sfas s exception from recognizing deferred tax liabilities 
fsp and fsp were both effective upon issuance 
we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of fsp and fsp will have on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the value of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we are exposed to some market risk due to the floating interest rate under our revolving credit facility and certain of our term debt 
as of december   our revolving credit facility had a principal balance of million and our variable long term debt had a principal balance of million  with interest rates that float with prime or libor 
a increase in interest rates could result in a million annual increase in interest expense on the existing principal balances 
we are also exposed to some market risk due to the foreign currency exchange rates related to our canadian operations 
we conduct our canadian business in the local currency  and thus the effects of foreign currency fluctuations are largely mitigated because the local expenses of such foreign operations are also denominated in the same currency 
assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date  resulting in translation adjustments that are reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section on our consolidated balance sheet 
less than of our net assets are impacted by changes in foreign currency in relation to the us dollar 
we recorded a million adjustment to our equity 
table of contents account for the year ended december  to reflect the net impact of the change in foreign currency exchange rate
