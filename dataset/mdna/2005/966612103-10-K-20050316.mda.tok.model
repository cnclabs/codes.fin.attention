item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of this discussion and analysis is to focus on significant changes in the financial condition of whitney holding corporation and its subsidiaries the company or whitney and on their results of operations during  and virtually all of the company s operations are contained in its banking subsidiary  whitney national bank the bank 
this discussion and analysis is intended to highlight and supplement information presented elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in item certain financial information in prior years has been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation 
forward looking statements this discussion includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
forward looking statements provide projections of results of operations or of financial condition or state other forward looking information  such as expectations about future conditions and descriptions of future plans and strategies 
forward looking statements often contain words such as anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  forecast  goal  intend  plan  project or other words of similar meaning 
the forward looking statements made in this discussion include  but may not be limited to a discussion of potential earnings volatility from changes in the estimated allowance for loan losses over time  b comments on the expected growth rate of the loan portfolio and conditions impacting certain industries represented in the customer base  c statements of the results of net interest income simulations run by the company to measure interest rate sensitivity  d comments about the performance of whitney s net interest income  net interest margin  yields on the loan and investment portfolios  and deposit rates assuming certain conditions  e comments about possible future levels of home loan refinancing activity  and f comments on expected changes or trends in expense levels for retirement benefits  current health benefits  equipment and data processing  amortization of intangibles  advertising and promotion and corporate value tax 
whitney s ability to accurately project results or predict the effects of future plans or strategies is inherently limited 
although whitney believes that the expectations reflected in forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions  actual results and performance could differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause actual results to differ from those expressed in the company s forward looking statements include  but are not limited to o changes in economic and business conditions  including those caused by natural disasters or by acts of war or terrorism  that directly or indirectly affect the financial health of whitney s customer base 
o changes in interest rates that affect the pricing of whitney s financial products  the demand for its financial services and the valuation of its financial assets and liabilities 
o changes in laws and regulations that significantly affect the activities of the banking industry and the industry s competitive position relative to other financial service providers 
o technological changes affecting the nature or delivery of financial products or services and the cost of providing them 
o the failure to capitalize on growth opportunities and realize cost savings in connection with business acquisitions 
o management s inability to develop and execute plans for whitney to effectively respond to unexpected changes 
whitney does not intend  and undertakes no obligation  to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of differences in actual results  changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting such statements 
overview whitney earned million in  or less than the million earned in per share earnings in were per basic share and per diluted share  each approximately lower than in the key components of s earnings performance follow o net interest income  on a taxable equivalent te basis  increased in  consistent with the growth in average earning assets over whitney s net interest margin te held steady between these periods 
the most important factors behind the increase in net interest income te in were loan growth and an improved mix of earning assets  rising market interest rates over the latter half of the year  continued liquidity in the deposit base  and careful management of the pricing structure for loans and deposits 
o the direction of overall credit quality was favorable during and whitney was able to reduce its allowance for loan losses by million from the end of net charge offs totaled million in  up from million in when the company made a significant recovery on a single relationship 
for  the company recognized a million provision for loan losses compared to a negative provision of million in o noninterest income decreased  or million  in fee income generated by whitney s secondary mortgage market operations was down million to a level less than half that generated in on a sharp reduction in home loan refinancing activity 
rising short term market rates led to an increase in the earnings credit allowed against service charges on certain business deposit accounts  which contributed to a  or million  decrease in deposit service charge income 
fees from bank cards were up  or million  in  on continued growth in transaction volumes 
trust service fees rose  or 
million  on new customer development and improved equity market valuations 
o noninterest expense was  or million  higher in the primary reason for this increase was the  or million  increase in personnel expense 
employee compensation increased  or million  with million of the total increase coming from the stock based component of management incentive compensation plans 
employee benefits expense was up  or million  mainly related to pension and current health benefits 
banking operations acquired in contributed approximately  or million  to the total increase in personnel expense for the year 
noninterest expense in also included a million loss on the abandonment of certain noncancelable facility leases  
million in costs to convert acquired operations to whitney s system and a 
million casualty loss for hurricane damage 
critical accounting policies whitney prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
a discussion of certain accounting principles and methods of applying those principles that are particularly important to this process is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in applying these principles to determine the amounts and other disclosures that are presented in the financial statements and discussed in this section  the company is required to make estimates and assumptions 
whitney believes that the determination of its estimate of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its application of other significant accounting policies 
factors considered in this determination and management s process are discussed in note and in the following section on loans  credit risk management and allowance for loan losses 
although management believes it has identified appropriate factors for review and designed and implemented adequate procedures to support the estimation process that are consistently followed  the allowance remains an estimate about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
over time  changes in economic conditions or the actual or perceived financial condition of whitney s credit customers or other factors can materially impact the allowance estimate  potentially subjecting the company to significant earnings volatility 
management makes a variety of assumptions in applying principles that govern the accounting for retirement benefits under the company s defined benefit pension plan 
these assumptions are essential to the actuarial valuation that determines the amounts whitney recognizes and certain disclosures it makes in the consolidated financial statements related to the operation of this plan see note in item 
two of the more significant assumptions concern the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate needed to discount projected benefits to their present value 
changes in these assumptions impact the cost of pension benefits recognized in earnings 
certain assumptions are closely tied to current conditions and are generally revised at each measurement date 
for example  the discount rate is set with reference to market yields on high quality fixed income investments 
other assumptions  such as the rate of return on assets  are determined  in part  with reference to historical and expected conditions over time and are not as susceptible to frequent revision 
holding other factors constant  pension cost will move opposite to changes in either the discount rate or the rate of return on assets 
recent trends in pension costs are discussed in the section on noninterest expense 
financial condition loans  credit risk management and allowance for loan losses loan portfolio developments total loans increased  or million  from year end  after growing in approximately million of loans was added through a business acquisition in the third quarter of the loan portfolio has grown consistently throughout and new customer development and demand from whitney s established customer base for commercial  commercial real estate and real estate development and construction loans has accounted for most of the increase 
table shows loan balances by type of loan at december  and at the end of the previous four years 
table loans outstanding by type december in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural      real estate commercial  construction and other      real estate residential mortgage      individuals      total loans      the portfolio of commercial loans  other than those secured by real property  was up million  or  compared to year end this portfolio sector grew million  or  in from the end of the bank acquisition in had little impact on this portfolio segment 
overall the portfolio remained well diversified  with customers in a wide range of industries  including oil and gas exploration and production  marine transportation  wholesale and retail trade in various durable and nondurable products and the manufacture of such products  financial services  and professional services 
also included in the commercial loan category are loans to individuals  generally secured by collateral other than real estate  that are used to fund investments in new or expanded business opportunities 
there have been no major trends or changes in the concentration mix of this portfolio category from year end the rate of commercial loan growth at the bank in will depend mainly on the economic fundamentals affecting its customers as well as on its ability to continue to develop customers in the newer parts of its market and take advantage of competitive circumstances to attract new business in its established market 
at december   outstanding loans to oil and gas industry customers represented approximately of total loans 
the outstanding balance of million at year end was comparable to the balance at the end of the major portion of the company s customer base in this industry provides transportation and other services and products to support exploration and production activities 
whitney seeks service and supply customers who are quality operators that can manage through volatile commodity price cycles 
with expectations of sustained higher commodity prices  whitney has increased its attention to lending opportunities in the exploration and production sector during and outstanding loans to exploration and production companies totaled close to a quarter of the industry portfolio at the end of the bank has a petroleum engineer on staff who participates in the underwriting of loans to exploration and production customers 
management  through the bank s credit policy committee  monitors both industry fundamentals and portfolio performance and credit quality on a formal ongoing basis and establishes and adjusts internal exposure guidelines as a percent of capital both for the industry as a whole and for individual sectors within the industry 
the level of activity in this industry continues to have an important impact on the economies of certain portions of whitney s market area  particularly southern louisiana and houston 
outstanding balances under participations in larger shared credit loan commitments totaled approximately million at december   including million related to the oil and gas industry 
substantially all such shared credits are with customers operating in whitney s market area 
the commercial real estate portfolio includes loans for construction and real estate development  both commercial and residential  loans secured by multi family residential properties  and loans secured by properties used in commercial or industrial operations 
this portfolio sector grew  or million  in  and  or million  in approximately million  or close to a third  of the growth in was from loans with acquired operations 
whitney has been able to develop new business in this highly competitive market throughout its market area  and the company continues to finance new projects for its established customer base 
the pace of new real estate project development has increased with improving economic conditions and higher confidence that these conditions will be sustained 
the level of growth achieved in a given period will be impacted by expected paydowns on and permanent takeouts of seasoned projects as developers take advantage of continued favorable long term financing rates 
the bank s credit policy committee has also set exposure guidelines for the overall portfolio of commercial real estate loans as well as for loans to developers or owner users that are secured by various subcategories of property 
as with lending to the oil and gas industry  management regularly monitors real estate industry fundamentals and portfolio credit quality 
in recent years  activity in this portfolio sector has been driven by the development of retail  small office and commercial facilities by customers throughout whitney s market area  and by apartment and condominium projects  particularly in the eastern gulf coast region 
financing activity for hotel and other hospitality industry projects  which have largely been concentrated in the new orleans metropolitan area  has slowed over this period 
the residential mortgage loan portfolio grew by million  or  from the end of to year end  with a third of this growth from acquisitions 
whitney has increased the promotion of tailored mortgage products that are held in the portfolio  although it continues to sell most conventional residential mortgage loan production in the secondary market 
this portfolio sector had declined over the previous three years as many loans refinanced while new production was sold 
there was little change in the total of fixed term home equity loans outstanding during this loan product offers customers the opportunity to leverage increased home values and equity to obtain tax advantaged consumer financing 
the rate of growth in this product slowed in recent years as borrowers increasingly tapped home equity when refinancing their primary home mortgages 
loans to individuals include various consumer installment and credit line loan products other than fixed term home equity loans 
this portfolio sector has grown moderately for several years  mainly from the promotion of secured personal credit lines

written credit policies define underwriting criteria  concentration guidelines  and lending approval processes that cover individual authority and the appropriate involvement of regional loan committees and a senior loan committee 
the senior loan committee is composed of the bank s senior lenders  senior officers in credit administration  the president and the chairman and chief executive officer 
commercial credits  including commercial real estate loans  are underwritten principally based upon cash flow coverage  but additional support is regularly obtained through collateralization and guarantees 
commercial loans are typically relationship based rather than transaction driven 
loan concentrations are monitored monthly by management and the board of directors 
consumer loans are centrally underwritten with the support of automated credit scoring tools  with appropriate secondary review procedures 
a strong monitoring process is the key to early identification of problem credits 
lending officers are responsible for ongoing monitoring and the assignment of risk ratings to individual loans based on established guidelines 
an independent credit review function reporting to the audit committee of the board of directors assesses the accuracy of officer ratings and the timeliness of rating changes and performs concurrent reviews of the underwriting processes 
once a problem relationship over a certain size threshold is identified  a quarterly watch committee process is initiated 
the watch committee  composed of senior lending and credit administration management  must approve any substantive changes to identified problem credits and assigns relationships to the special credits department when appropriate 
management s evaluation of credit risk in the portfolio is ultimately reflected in the estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the portfolio that is reported in the company s financial statements as the allowance for loan losses 
changes in this ongoing evaluation over time are reflected in the provision for loan losses charged to expense 
the methodology for determining the allowance involves significant judgment and important factors that influence this judgment are re evaluated quarterly to respond to changing conditions 
the recorded allowance encompasses three elements allowances established for losses on criticized loans  allowances based on historical loss experience for loans with acceptable credit quality and groups of homogeneous loans not individually rated  and allowances based on general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors internal and external to the company 
criticized loans are credits with above average weaknesses as identified through the internal risk rating process 
criticized loans include those that are deemed to be impaired as defined by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
specific allowances are determined for impaired loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s contractual interest rate  the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  or  when available  the loan s observable market price 
the allowance for the remainder of criticized loans is calculated by applying loss factors to loan balances aggregated by the severity of the internal risk rating 
the loss factors applied to criticized loans are determined with reference to the results of migration analysis  which analyzes the charge off experience over time for loans with in each rating category 
for the second element  loans assessed as having average or better credit quality with similar risk ratings and homogeneous loans not subject to individual rating  such as residential mortgage loans  consumer installment loans and draws under consumer credit lines  are grouped together and individual loss factors are applied to each group 
the loss factors for homogeneous loan groups are based on average historical charge off information 
industry based factors are applied to other portfolio segments for which migration analysis has not been performed 
determining the final element of the allowance involves assessing how other current factors  both internal and external  impact the accuracy of results obtained for the other two elements 
internally  management must consider whether trends have been identified in the quality of underwriting and loan administration as well as in the timely identification of credit quality issues 
management also monitors shifts in portfolio concentrations and other changes in portfolio characteristics that indicate levels of risk not fully captured in the loss factors 
external factors include local and national economic trends  as well as changes in the economic fundamentals of specific industries that are well represented in whitney s customer base 
management has established procedures to help ensure a consistent approach to this inherently judgmental process over time

the initial reset dates on these securities are mainly within four to six years from the end of whitney has increased the proportion of both mortgage backed securities and state and municipal obligations held in the portfolio over the past two years and the duration of the portfolio increased to years at december  from years at year end the duration of the portfolio at december  would extend to years assuming an immediate basis point increase in market rates  according to the company s asset liability management model 
duration provides a measure of the sensitivity of the portfolio s fair value to changes in interest rates 
securities available for sale constituted of the total investment portfolio at december  there was a net unrealized loss on this portfolio segment of million at year end gross losses totaled million and were mainly related to mortgage backed securities and certain longer maturity u

government agency securities 
the gross losses represented a little over of the total amortized cost for the underlying securities 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides information on the process followed by management to evaluate whether unrealized losses on securities  both those available for sale and those held to maturity  represent impairment that is other than temporary and that should be recognized with a charge to operations 
substantially all the unrealized losses at december  resulted from increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased 
management identified no value impairment related to credit quality in the portfolio 
at december   management had both the intent and ability to hold value impaired securities until full recovery of cost and no impairment was evaluated as other than temporary 
no impairment losses were recognized in any of the three years in the period ended december  the company does not normally maintain a trading portfolio  other than holding trading account securities for short periods while buying and selling securities for customers 
such securities  if any  are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets

deposits and borrowings deposits at december  were up  or million  from the level at year end deposits with locations acquired in contributed approximately to the growth rate for the year

lower cost deposits made up a little more than three quarters of total deposits at the end of both and  and noninterest bearing demand deposits held steady at close to one third of deposits 
each of these percentages was up slightly from the end of higher cost time deposits at december  were up  or million  compared to year end acquired deposits contributed million to this increase  including approximately million of time deposits of  and over 
the increase in time deposits of  or more in mainly reflected the attraction of temporary excess funds of certain larger commercial customers to treasury management deposit products and the addition of competitively bid public funds  partly as an alternative to other short term borrowings 
public fund time deposits totaled million at december   up million from december  table maturities of time deposits deposits of deposits of  less than in thousands or more  total three months or less    over three months through six months    over six months through twelve months    over twelve months    total    short term and other borrowings increased  or million  from year end  but were up  or million  on average compared to the prior year 
the main source of short term borrowings has been the sale of securities under repurchase agreements to customers using whitney s treasury management sweep product 
the total of borrowings from customers under repurchase agreements was stable between the end of and s year end  but has declined on average  or million  in and in  in part reflecting a shift to treasury management and other deposit products with the elimination of any comparative yield advantage 
because of the underlying customer relationship  these borrowings serve as a relatively stable source of funds 
during  the bank began using advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb as an additional source of short term funds to support loan growth 
at december   such advances totaled million  and the average borrowings during the year totaled million 
other sources of wholesale short term funding include federal funds purchased and brokered repurchase agreements 
additional information on borrowings  including yields and maximum amounts borrowed  is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
shareholders equity and capital adequacy shareholders equity totaled million at december   which represented an increase of million from the end of during  whitney retained million of earnings  net of dividends declared  but this was partly offset by an million decrease in other comprehensive income representing an unrealized net holding loss on securities available for sale during the million shares issued in a business acquisition in august were valued at million  and whitney recognized million in additional equity during from activity in stock based compensation plans for employees and directors  including option exercises 
the company repurchased thousand shares at a cost of million under a plan announced in october total shareholders equity grew million in  to million at december  net retained earnings of million and million in additional equity from stock based compensation plan activity were partly offset by a million other comprehensive loss 
the company paid a relatively stable percentage of its earnings in dividends over the last three years 
the dividend payout ratio was in  in and in the ratios in table indicate that the company remained strongly capitalized at december  the increase in risk weighted assets at december  from the end of resulted mainly from an increase in loans and other on balance sheet assets  including those acquired in business combinations  and  to a lesser degree  from growth in off balance sheet obligations  such as loan facilities and letters of credit  which are converted to assets for the risk based capital calculations 
goodwill and other intangible assets recognized in a business acquisition are excluded from risk weighted assets 
these intangible assets  however  are also deducted in determining regulatory capital and serve to offset the addition to capital for the value of shares issued as consideration for the acquisition

liquidity management and contractual obligations liquidity management the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available to meet cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  while at the same time meeting the operating  capital and strategic cash flow needs of the company and the bank 
whitney develops its liquidity management strategies and measures and monitors liquidity risk as part of its overall asset liability management process  making full use of quantitative modeling tools available to project cash flows under a variety of possible scenarios 
projections are also made assuming credit stressed conditions  although such conditions are not likely to arise 
on the liability side  liquidity management focuses on growing the base of core deposits at competitive rates  including the use of treasury management products for commercial customers  while at the same time ensuring access to economical wholesale funding sources 
the section above on deposits and borrowings discusses changes in these liability funding sources in whitney national bank is a member of the federal home loan bank system 
this membership provides access to a variety of fhlb advance products as an alternative source of funds  and the bank increased its use of this funding source during in addition  both the company and the bank have access to external funding sources in the financial markets  and the bank has developed the ability to gather deposits at a nationwide level  although it has not used this ability to date 
liquidity management on the asset side primarily addresses the composition and maturity structure of the loan portfolio and the portfolio of investment securities and their ability to generate cash flows from scheduled payments  contractual maturities  and prepayments  through use as collateral for borrowings  and through possible sale or securitization 
table above presents the contractual maturity structure of the loan portfolio and table presents contractual investment maturities 
cash generated from operations is another important source of funds to meet liquidity needs 
the consolidated statements of cash flows present operating cash flows and summarize all significant sources and uses of funds for each year in the three year period ended december  continued high levels of liquidity in the deposit base helped support increased loan production and overall earning asset growth in and again in management anticipates that some of this funds availability will moderate with increased economic activity  renewed confidence in the capital markets and rising market interest rates and has factored this possibility into its liquidity projections and planning processes 
at december   whitney holding corporation had approximately million in cash and demand notes from the bank available to provide liquidity for acquisitions  dividend payments to shareholders  stock repurchases or other corporate uses  before consideration of any future dividends that may be received from the bank 
during  the bank will have available an amount equal to approximately million plus its current net income to declare as dividends to the company without prior regulatory approval 
in october  the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to million shares of its common stock 
as of december   whitney had repurchased  shares at a total cost of million 
based on the company s closing stock price at year end  the cash outlay to complete the repurchase program would total approximately million 
the repurchase program extends through october whitney has announced an agreement to acquire destin bancshares  inc for stock and cash in a transaction expected to close in the first half of the cash component of the purchase price will total approximately million 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes payments due from the company under specified long term and certain other contractual obligations as of december  obligations under deposit contracts and short term fhlb advances are not included 
the maturities of time deposits are scheduled in table above in the section on deposits and borrowings 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides information on short term fhlb advances outstanding at year end purchase obligations represent legal and binding contracts to purchase services or goods that cannot be settled or terminated without paying substantially all of the contractual amounts 
the balance includes approximately million under contracts to construct or improve bank facilities 
not included are a number of contracts entered into to support ongoing operations that either do not specify fixed or minimum amounts of goods or services or are cancelable on short notice without cause and without significant penalty 
the consolidated statements of cash flows provide a picture of whitney s ability to fund these and other more significant cash operating expenses  such as interest expense and compensation and benefits  out of current operating cash flows

a million nonqualified plan obligation was recorded at year end c the recorded obligation for postretirement benefits other than pensions was million at december  the funding to purchase benefits for current retirees  net of retiree contributions  has not been significant 
off balance sheet arrangements as a normal part of its business  the company enters into arrangements that create financial obligations that are not recognized  wholly or in part  in the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these arrangements  such as noncancelable operating leases  are reflected in table above 
the most significant off balance sheet obligations are the bank s commitments under traditional credit related financial instruments 
table schedules these commitments as of december  by the periods in which they expire 
commitments under credit card and personal credit lines generally have no stated maturity 
table credit related commitments dollars in thousands commitments expiring by period from december  less than more than total year years years years loan commitments revolving     loan commitments nonrevolving    credit card and personal credit lines   standby and other letters of credit    total     revolving loan commitments are issued primarily to support commercial activities 
the availability of funds under revolving loan commitments generally depends on whether the borrower continues to meet credit standards established in the underlying contract and has not violated other contractual conditions 
many such commitments are used only partially or not at all before they expire 
credit card and personal credit lines are generally subject to cancellation if the borrower s credit quality deteriorates  and many lines remain partly or wholly unused 
unfunded balances on revolving loan commitments and credit lines should not be used to project actual future liquidity requirements 
nonrevolving loan commitments are issued mainly to provide financing for the acquisition and development or construction of real property  both commercial and residential  although many are not expected to lead to permanent financing by the bank 
expectations about the level of draws under all credit related commitments are incorporated into the company s liquidity and asset liability management models 
substantially all of the letters of credit are standby agreements that obligate the bank to fulfill a customer s financial commitments to a third party if the customer is unable to perform 
the bank issues standby letters of credit primarily to provide credit enhancement to its customers other commercial or public financing arrangements and to help them demonstrate financial capacity to vendors 
the company has historically had minimal calls to perform under standby agreements 
asset liability management the objective of the company s asset liability management is to implement strategies for the funding and deployment of its financial resources that are expected to maximize soundness and profitability over time at acceptable levels of risk 
interest rate sensitivity is the potential impact of changing rate environments on both net interest income and cash flows 
the company has developed a model to measure its interest rate sensitivity by running net interest income simulations and monitoring the economic value of equity 
the model can be used to test the company s sensitivity in various economic environments 
the model incorporates management s assumptions and expectations regarding such factors as loan and deposit growth  pricing  prepayment speeds and spreads between interest rates 
assumptions can also be entered into the model to evaluate the impact of possible strategic responses to changes in the competitive environment 
management  through the company s asset liability committee  monitors simulation results against rate sensitivity guidelines specified in whitney s asset liability management policy 
the net interest income simulations run at the end of indicated that whitney was moderately asset sensitive over the near term  similar to its position at year end based on these simulations  annual net interest income te would be expected to increase million  or  and decrease million  or  if interest rates instantaneously increased or decreased  respectively  from current rates by basis points 
these changes are measured against the results of a base simulation run that uses current growth forecasts and assumes a stable rate environment and structure 
the comparable simulation run at year end produced results that ranged from a positive impact on net interest income te of million  or  to a negative impact of million  or 
at the end of each year  additional simulations were run applying instantaneous parallel rate shocks up to basis points as well as gradual rate changes of up to basis points 
in the recent rate environment  certain downward rate shocks caused unrealistic model assumptions  and the results from these simulation runs were disregarded 
the actual impact that changes in interest rates have on net interest income will depend on many factors 
these include whitney s ability to achieve expected growth in earning assets and maintain a desired mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the actual timing when assets and liabilities reprice  the magnitude of interest rate changes  interest rate spreads and the level of success of asset liability management strategies implemented 
the method used for measuring longer term interest rate risk is the economic value of equity analysis 
at year end  the simulated measure of the company s sensitivity was acceptable under internal guidelines at all levels of rate shock that produced realistic model assumptions 
changes in interest rates affect the fair values of financial instruments 
the earlier section on investment securities and notes and to the consolidated financial statements contain information regarding fair values 
the bank has used interest rate swaps on a limited basis to bring the market risk associated with the longer duration fixed rate loans desired by some customers in line with whitney s asset liability management objectives 
no interest rate swap agreements were in effect at december  swap activity has had minimal impact on financial condition and results of operations 
other than this swap activity  the company has made no investments in financial instruments or participated in agreements with values that are linked to or derived from changes in the value of some underlying asset or index 
these are commonly referred to as derivatives and include such instruments as futures  forward contracts  option contracts  and other financial arrangements with similar characteristics 
management continues to evaluate whether to make additional use of derivatives as part of its asset liability and liquidity management processes 
results of operations net interest income te whitney s net interest income te increased million  or  in  consistent with the growth in average earning assets from the net interest margin te was essentially stable between these periods 
the net interest margin is net interest income te as a percent of average earning assets 
the most important factors behind the increase in net interest income in were loan growth and an improved mix of earning assets  rising market interest rates over the second half of the year  continued liquidity in the deposit base  and careful management of the pricing structure for both loans and deposits 
tables and provide details on the components of the company s net interest income te and net interest margin te 
average loans  which in table includes loans held for sale  increased in and comprised of average earning assets for the period  up from in a further shift to variable pricing within the loan portfolio and the concentration of loan growth in high quality commercial credits contributed to a basis point decline in annual loan yields te between and this trend also positioned the portfolio for more rapid yield improvement with rising short term market rates  as was evident in the basis point increase in loan yields te from the second quarter to the fourth quarter of as of year end  balances of loans with adjustable rates tied to short term market rate indices or prime totaled approximately of the dollar value of the portfolio  compared with at the end of after several years of sustained low market interest rates  short term rates began to increase in mid prompting an increase in bank prime rates totaling basis points by year end 
the yield on the largely fixed rate investment portfolio is less responsive to changes in market rates and the overall investment portfolio yield te has fluctuated within a narrow range during and the overall yield te on average earning assets was in compared to in  a decrease of basis points 
the overall earning asset yield has increased basis points during the second half of compared to the yield in s second quarter 
the overall cost of funds decreased basis points between and as with earning assets  however  the cost of funds has increased since the second quarter of with rising market rates 
whitney s management of the deposit pricing structure helped limit this increase between the second and fourth quarters of to basis points 
the cost of interest bearing deposits declined basis points in  but increased basis points during the second half of the year 
substantially all of this increase was from a basis point increase in the rate paid on time deposits  which partly reflected a higher level of public funds in the deposit base as well as the cost structure of deposits acquired in a business combination in the third quarter of the overall rate on short term and other borrowings  which is more sensitive to market rate changes  increased basis points between and and was up basis points from the second quarter to the fourth quarter of changes in the mix of funding sources have a significant impact on the direction of the overall cost of funds 
the overall funding mix shifted only slightly in compared to average noninterest bearing deposits funded of average earning assets in  up from in  and the percentage of funding from all noninterest bearing sources was steady at between these periods 
lower cost interest bearing deposits supported of earning assets in  down slightly from in higher cost sources of funds  which include time deposits and short term and other borrowings  totaled of average earning assets in and in whitney s ability to maintain this favorable mix of funding sources will depend heavily on  among other factors  its success in growing or retaining the deposit base in a highly competitive environment and in managing its deposit pricing structure as rates rise on alternative financial products available to its customers

net interest income te was little changed between and the operating environment for much of proved a more difficult one for generating growth in net interest income te 
the most important characteristics of this environment for whitney were sustained low market interest rates  high levels of liquidity in the deposit base  and moderate but improving loan demand 
the relative stability of the net interest margin te  which declined basis points  was the result of numerous factors  including the implementation of successful pricing strategies on deposits  careful deployment of excess liquidity in the deposit base  and pricing discipline on loans in a highly competitive market 
earning assets grew by compared to  mainly reflecting accelerated loan growth toward the latter part of asset yields trended lower in as higher yielding fixed rate instruments gradually repriced and new funds  including those from accelerated home mortgage refinancings  were invested in an environment of low  though relatively stable  market interest rates 
loan yields te decreased basis points compared to  and the average yield te on the investment portfolio was lower by basis points  including the impact of a basis point decrease in the yield on mortgage backed issues 
the decrease in the overall yield te on earning assets was limited to basis points in as loan growth and a redeployment of excess liquidity from short term investments to the investment portfolio improved the earning asset mix 
in this rate environment  whitney s funding costs also trended down in  including the impact of the gradual repricing of fixed rate time deposits 
sustained low rates and demand for deposit products allowed whitney to implement deposit pricing strategies to help shift the mix of funding sources in favor of noninterest bearing and lower cost interest bearing sources 
the average rate on lower cost interest bearing deposits decreased basis points in  and the average rate on time deposits was down basis points compared to the overall cost of funds in was basis points lower than in provision for loan losses the overall credit risk profile of whitney s customer base improved in both and with these improvements  whitney was able to reduce its allowance for loan losses by million in  following a reduction of million in net charge offs were million in  compared to million in when there was a significant recovery on a single relationship 
in  whitney recognized a million provision for losses  compared to a negative provision of million in and a million provision in for a more detailed discussion of changes in the allowance for loan losses  nonperforming assets and general credit quality  see the earlier section on loans  credit risk management and allowance for loan losses 
the future level of the allowance and provisions for loan losses will reflect management s ongoing evaluation of credit risk  based on established internal policies and practices 
noninterest income table shows the components of noninterest income for each year in the three year period ended december   along with the percent changes between years for each component 
noninterest income decreased  or million  in after increasing  or million  in table noninterest income dollars in thousands change change service charges on deposit accounts    bank card fees    trust service fees    secondary mortgage market operations    atm fees    investment services income    other fees and charges    other operating income    net gain on sales and other revenue from foreclosed assets    net gains on disposals of surplus property a securities transactions total noninterest income    a not meaningful 
income from service charges on deposit accounts declined  or million  in  but was little changed between and service charges include periodic account maintenance fees  for both business and personal customers  charges for specific transactions or services  such as processing return items or wire transfers  and other revenue associated with deposit accounts  such as commissions on check sales 
account maintenance fees for business customers were down  or million  in  after increasing in the fees charged on a large number of business accounts are based on an analysis of account activity  and these accounts are allowed to offset accumulated charges with an earnings credit based on balances maintained in the account 
the rate used to calculate the earnings credit is based on short term market rates 
analysis account fees declined  or million  in  reflecting in large part the increase in the earnings credit rate over the latter half of growth in analysis fee income in recent years has also been restrained by higher levels of liquidity in the deposit base  some reduction in the volume of chargeable transactions  and the migration of customers with lower transaction volumes to fixed fee business account products 
total fixed fee account fees  though still small relative to total analysis fees  increased in and in personal account service charges were lower in both and  by approximately 
million in each period  largely reflecting the loss of lower balance customers to competitive no fee account products  which have been aggressively promoted in parts of whitney s market area 
income from charges for specific transactions and services increased 
million in after a 
million decrease in the increase in reflected improved pricing and expanded services 
bank card fees increased  or approximately million  in both and this category includes fees from activity on bank issued credit and debit cards 
fee income from credit card activity grew in  consistent with the growth in transaction volume  and was up in debit card fee income was up  or 
million  in  on a increase in transaction volume 
this followed income growth of  or 
million  in when transaction volume rose 
the growth in fee income in did not fully reflect the underlying growth in transaction volume because of a temporary rate reduction starting in august under the terms of a settlement between visa usa and merchants 
visa usa subsequently restructured debit transaction rates in early  effectively lowering them to below pre settlement levels 
the fees generated per transaction under the restructured rates  however  have been somewhat higher than under the temporary rate reduction in trust service fees in increased  or 
million  compared to from new business and improved equity market valuations relative to the earlier period 
during  whitney positioned additional relationship officers to attract and service trust and wealth management customers across its market area 
the decrease in trust service fees between and was also largely related to equity market valuations during these periods 
investment service income decreased in and in market conditions in and limited demand for fixed income securities transactions among whitney s customer base and reduced the demand for and the profitability of annuity products 
at the same time  there was some improvement in retail brokerage activity in both and with improving equity markets and investor confidence 
fee income generated by whitney s secondary mortgage market operations in decreased million to a level less than half that generated in this followed an increase of million  or  in low rates have benefited loan production volumes for several years by prompting homeowners to refinance and by helping sustain demand for new home purchases 
although rates remained low during from a historical perspective  they could not stimulate refinancing activity to the levels seen in and total home loan production  including loans originated for the portfolio  was million in  million in and million in refinancing activity accounted for approximately of the total dollar volume of loans originated in  compared to in and in whitney sold approximately of total production in  compared to in and in given the current rate environment  a significant resurgence in refinancing activity is not expected over the near term 
fees on letters of credit and unused loan commitments are the main component of other fees and charges and were the major factor in the increase in this income category in successful lending efforts led to another increase in credit related fees in  but this was more than offset by the elimination of revenues from an outsourcing agreement that was cancelled 
other operating income in included a gain of million recognized on the sale of a portfolio of seasoned loans originated under affordable housing programs 
the net gain on sales and other revenue from foreclosed assets includes income from grandfathered assets that vary from year to year as opportunities for sales arise 
management evaluates its banking facilities on an ongoing basis to identify possible under utilization and to determine the need for functional improvements  relocations or possible sales 
the net gains recognized in each period from dispositions of surplus banking property are shown in table noninterest expense table shows the components of noninterest expense for each year in the three year period ended december   along with the percent changes between years for each component 
noninterest expense increased  or million  in  following an increase of  or million  between and table noninterest expense dollars in thousands change change employee compensation    employee benefits    total personnel    net occupancy    equipment and data processing    telecommunication and postage    corporate value and franchise taxes    legal and other professional services    amortization of intangibles    security and other outsourced services    advertising and promotion    operating supplies    bank card processing services    deposit insurance and regulatory fees    miscellaneous operating losses    other operating expense    total noninterest expense    personnel expense represented more than half of the company s noninterest expense in each period and was the major factor in fluctuations from year to year 
employee compensation increased  or million  in  and was up  or million  in employee compensation includes base pay  compensation earned under sales based and other employee incentive programs  and compensation expense under management incentive plans 
base pay rose  or million  in  with acquired operations contributing approximately to the total percentage increase 
this followed a  or million  increase from to with continued attention to efficient management of human resources  whitney s full time equivalent staff grew less than from year end to the end of the average staff level increased approximately in  largely from acquisitions  new branches and added relationship officers  but had declined in from employees earned million less under sales based incentive plans during than in incentive compensation in had been million higher than in incentive pay for residential mortgage loan production was the main factor in each year  reflecting the significant fluctuations between periods in loan origination volumes 
increased stock based compensation was the main factor behind increases in management incentive plan expense of million in and million in whitney has recognized stock based compensation expense with respect to performance based restricted stock grants that have been awarded under long term incentive plans for key employees 
this expense fluctuates with changes in the company s stock price  employee participation levels  and expectations about the extent to which performance objectives will be met 
as is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  new authoritative guidance has been issued that establishes the fair value based method as the exclusive method of accounting for stock based compensation and is effective for awards  including awards of stock options  which are granted  modified  repurchased  or cancelled after june  this new guidance also changes how whitney will calculate compensation expense for unvested restricted stock awards beginning with the third quarter of it is unlikely that the new calculation will yield results materially different from those that would be determined under the current method 
employee benefits expense increased  or million  in  and was up  or million  in the major components of employee benefits expense  in addition to payroll taxes  are the cost of providing health benefits for active and retired employees and the cost of providing pension benefits through both the defined benefit plans and a k employee savings plan 
the performance of the pension trust fund and trends in market yields on fixed income securities in one period cause fluctuations in the actuarially determined periodic expense for the defined benefit pension plan in future periods  holding other variables constant 
a weak investment performance in and a decline in relevant market yields were followed by a million increase in pension expense in pension expense increased a more moderate 
million in although fixed income market yields declined again in  the trust fund posted better than assumed investment returns for the year 
an million employer contribution to the pension trust toward the end of also had a favorable impact on expense 
pension expense in is expected to increase somewhat faster than in  reflecting a further decline in market yields in and investment performance in line with assumptions 
trends in fixed income market yields also impact the actuarial valuation results for postretirement health benefits as do trends in actual benefit outlays 
lower rates and unfavorable benefit experience in led to a 
million expense increase in the cost of postretirement health benefits in was favorably impacted by legislation on prescription drug benefits under medicare enacted in late as is discussed more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the cost of providing health coverage to active employees increased million  in  net of employee contributions  and has been increasing at a pace well above the general rate of inflation for a number of years 
this mainly reflects broad trends in the consumption and cost of medical services  including prescription drugs 
although whitney seeks to provide competitive benefits in a cost efficient manner  and management reviews the structure of whitney s health plans and the appropriate level of employee cost sharing on a regular basis  an increase in expense comparable to that in is expected for net occupancy expense increased  or 
million  in  with expansion as the main factor 
whitney opened six new or replacement branches from late through the end of  including three new locations to serve the houston market 
these were in addition to locations acquired in tampa and ft 
walton in six new or replacement branches are scheduled to open during net occupancy declined moderately in several branch facilities were eliminated during after their operations were consolidated with nearby existing locations 
to reduce costs over the long term and enhance productivity  certain operations in houston were moved to one of the new facilities in and out of office space that is subject to a noncancelable lease 
whitney recognized a loss of million in related to its remaining obligation under the lease when the move was completed 
this loss is included with miscellaneous operating losses in table equipment and data processing expense increased in after declining  or million  in the company s equipment and data processing expense in recent years has shown the benefit of aggressive contract management and close control over capital expenditures for both new projects and the replacement of fully depreciated assets 
branch expansion and acquisitions were a factor in the expense increase in although cost control efforts will continue  additional branch expansion  the outsourcing of atm operations and the introduction of new applications and capabilities to support expanded customer service are expected to lead to a somewhat higher rate of increase in this expense category in the total expense for professional services  both legal and other services  was slightly lower in each of the last two years 
legal expense  which covers services for both loan collection efforts and general corporate matters  was down in  partly reflecting improvements in loan credit quality in that have continued through the expense for other professional services in increased from the total in included 
million for system conversion services related to a business acquisition and additional audit and consulting fees associated with whitney s compliance with the internal control provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of both legal and other professional service fees were relatively stable between and bank and branch acquisitions in led to an increase in amortization of intangibles in mainly associated with the value of deposit relationships acquired in these transactions 
there were no acquisitions in or amortization expense of million is scheduled for this amount does not include the impact of a pending business acquisition expected to be completed in the first half of note to the consolidated financial statements reviews completed and pending acquisitions 
the expense for security and other outsourced services increased in after rising in the outsourcing of trust related processing services was the main contributor to the larger increase in during  management directed an additional million to advertising and promotional activities 
this mainly supported the execution of a campaign aimed at enhanced image awareness and brand differentiation throughout much of whitney s market area 
this campaign was largely completed by the end of and no comparable campaign is currently planned for no major campaigns were introduced in  while included the final phase of a multi faceted advertising campaign featuring a louisiana based celebrity spokesperson that had been launched in bank card processing services expense will vary mainly with changes in transaction volume on bank issued credit cards 
transaction volumes and bank card fee income are discussed in the earlier section on noninterest income 
in addition to the lease abandonment charge mentioned earlier  miscellaneous operating losses in included a 
million casualty loss for property damage sustained when hurricane ivan struck the florida alabama coastal border during the year 
storm related disruptions to banking operations were minimal 
the expense categories included in other operating expense were up  or million  on a combined basis in  and  or million  in the required amortization of new affordable housing project investments was the main factor behind the increase in and an important factor in tax credits associated with the affordable housing investments reduced income tax expense and the effective tax rates as noted in the following section and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company experienced a sharp jump in its insurance premiums in when certain coverage was renewed in an insurance market much harder than at the beginning of the prior multi year contract 
income taxes the company provided for income tax expense at an effective rate of in  in and in the effective tax rate has been lower than the statutory federal tax rate primarily because of tax exempt interest income from the financing of state and local governments and the availability of tax credits generated by investments in affordable housing projects 
the following reconciles reported income tax expense to that computed at the statutory federal tax rate for each year in the three year period ended december  table income taxes in thousands income tax expense at of pre tax income    increase decrease resulting from tax exempt income    low income housing credits   state income tax and miscellaneous items income tax expense reported    louisiana sourced income of commercial banks is not subject to state income taxes 
rather  banks in louisiana pay a tax based on the value of their capital stock in lieu of income and franchise taxes  and this tax is allocated to parishes in which the banks maintain branches 
whitney s corporate value tax is included in noninterest expense 
this expense will fluctuate in part based on the growth in the bank s equity and earnings and in part based on market valuation trends for the banking industry 
fourth quarter results whitney earned million for the quarter ended december   a increase compared to net income of million reported for the fourth quarter of per share earnings were 
per basic share and 
per diluted share in s fourth quarter  up and  respectively  from 
per share  both basic and diluted  in the year earlier period 
selected fourth quarter highlights follow o whitney s net interest income te increased million  or  compared to the fourth quarter of  driven by both a increase in average earning assets and a widening net interest margin 
the net interest margin te was for the fourth quarter of  up basis points from the year earlier period  and up basis points from s third quarter 
the overall yield on earning assets increased basis points from the fourth quarter of  and was basis points higher than the third quarter of  reflecting both rising benchmark rates for the significant variable rate segment of whitney s loan portfolio and an increase in the percentage of loans in the earning asset mix 
funding costs for s fourth quarter were up basis points from the fourth quarter of and basis points from s third quarter 
the growth in earning assets compared to the fourth quarter of was mainly funded by growth in deposits  which increased between these periods 
o whitney provided million for loan losses in the fourth quarter of there was no provision in the fourth quarter of net charge offs totaled million in s fourth quarter and million in the year earlier period  or 
of average loans on an annualized basis in each period 
there was no significant shift in whitney s overall credit risk posture during the fourth quarter of collections and charge offs led to a million net reduction in total nonperforming loans from the end of s third quarter 
there was little change during s fourth quarter in the total of loans criticized through the internal credit risk classification process or in the classification mix 
o noninterest income decreased  or million  from the fourth quarter of fee income generated by whitney s secondary mortgage market operations in the fourth quarter of was down million to a level approximately half that generated in the year earlier period 
the rate environment for home loans during  though still low from a historical perspective  was unable to stimulate refinancing activity at the levels seen in recent years 
the earnings credit allowed against service charges on certain business deposit accounts has increased with rising short term market rates  contributing to a  or million  decrease in deposit service charge income compared to the fourth quarter of bank card fees  both credit and debit cards  increased a combined  or 
million  compared to s fourth quarter  reflecting both higher transaction volumes and improvement in the effective fee rates realized 
trust service fees increased  or 
million  compared to the fourth quarter of from new business and some improvement in equity market valuations relative to the year earlier period 
o noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of increased  or million  from s fourth quarter 
incremental costs associated with acquired operations totaled approximately million in the fourth quarter of personnel expense was up  or million  in total  including 
million for the acquired operations 
base pay and compensation earned under sales based and other employee incentive programs increased a combined  or million  with 
million from acquired operations 
compensation expense under management incentive programs was up  or 
million  with stock based compensation driving this increase 
the rising cost of providing current health benefits accounted for approximately half of the  or 
million  increase in employee benefits
