critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  warranty obligations  goodwill and intangible asset valuation and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company s policy is to recognize revenue for product sales when evidence of an arrangement exists  sales price is determinable or fixed  title transfers and risk of loss has passed to the customer  which is generally upon shipment of our products to our customers 
the company defers and recognizes service revenue over the contractual period or as services are rendered 
some distributor agreements allow for potential return of products and provide price protection under certain conditions within limited time periods 
such return rights are generally limited to short term stock rotation 
the company estimates sales returns and price adjustments based upon historical experience and other qualitative factors 
the company estimates expected sales returns and price adjustments and records the amounts as a reduction of revenue at the later of the time of shipment or when the pricing decision is made 
each period  price protection is estimated based upon pricing decisions made and information received from distributors as to the amount of inventory they are holding 
the company s policies comply with the guidance provided by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  issued by the securities and exchange commission 
judgments are required in evaluating the credit worthiness of our customers 
credit is not extended to customers and revenue is not recognized until the company has determined that the collection risk is minimal 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  the company obtains credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer when determining or modifying their credit limits 
the company regularly evaluates the collectibility of its trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
when a customer s account balance becomes past due  the company initiates dialogue with the customer to determine the cause 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to the company  such as in the case of bankruptcy  deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business  the company records a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company expects to recover 
the company also records an allowance for all customers based on certain other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due  the amount outstanding  and historical collection experience with customers 
the company believes its reported allowances are adequate 
however  if the financial condition of those customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  the company may need to record additional allowances which would result in additional general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination was made 
inventory 
the company is exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of its inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage  or subject to lower of cost or market issues 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological and regulatory changes in the company s markets  the company s ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  forecasting errors  new product introductions  quality issues with key suppliers  product phase outs and the availability of key components from the company s suppliers 
the company s policy is to reduce the value of inventory when conditions exist that suggest that its inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon its assumptions about future demand for its products and market conditions 
the company regularly evaluates its ability to realize the value of its inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
purchasing practices and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  the company s adjustments are intended to reduce the carrying value of its inventory to its net realizable value 
if actual demand for the company s products deteriorates or market conditions become less favorable than those that the company projects  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
product warranties 
the company s products are sold with warranty provisions that require it to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance over a specified period of time  generally between and months  at no cost to the company s customers 
the company s policy is to establish warranty reserves at levels that represent its estimate of the costs that will be incurred to fulfill those warranty requirements at the time that revenue is recognized 
the company believes that its recorded liabilities are adequate to cover its future cost of materials  labor and overhead for the servicing of its products 
if product failure rates  or material or service delivery costs differ from the company s estimates  its warranty liability would need to be revised accordingly 
intangible assets 
the company adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on accounting for business combinations and goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal year accordingly  the company no longer amortizes goodwill from acquisitions  but continues to amortize other acquisition related intangibles and costs 
as required by these rules  the company performs an impairment review of goodwill annually or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
based upon an impairment analysis performed in the fourth quarter of  goodwill was found to be impaired see additional discussion in notes and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the impairment review was based on a discounted cash flow approach that used estimates of future market share and revenues and costs for the relevant segments as well as appropriate discount rates 
the estimates used were consistent with the plans and estimates that the company uses to manage the underlying businesses 
in the future  if the company fails to deliver new products for these groups  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance  or if market conditions in the related businesses become unfavorable  revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and the company may incur further charges for impairment of goodwill 
for identifiable intangible assets  the company amortizes the cost over the estimated useful life and assesses any impairment by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows from the associated asset in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
based upon impairment analyses performed in fiscal  an impairment charge was recorded see additional discussion in notes and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
if the estimated cash flow related to these assets decreases in the future or the useful life is shorter than originally estimated  the company may incur further charges for impairment of these assets 
the revised value is based on the new estimated undiscounted cash flow associated with the asset 
additional impairment could result if the associated products do not sell as expected 
income taxes 
the company records a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company assesses the need for a valuation allowance based upon its estimate of future taxable income covering a relatively short time horizon given the volatility in the markets the company serves and its historic operating results 
tax planning strategies to use the company s recorded deferred tax assets are also considered 
if the company is able to realize the deferred tax assets in an amount in excess of its reported net amounts  an adjustment to decrease the valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets would increase earnings in the period such a determination was made 
similarly  if the company should determine that its net deferred tax assets may not be realized to the extent reported  an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance associated with the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such a determination was made 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of sales of certain items in the consolidated financial statements of the company

gross profit gross margins as a percentage of sales decreased to in as compared to in about two thirds of the reduction was due to the lower margins in the commercial segment 
in addition  the write off of excess inventory no longer in production  and vendor quality issues associated with high resolution glass used in the medical segment negatively impacted gross margins in these reductions in gross margin were partially offset by higher sales volumes and prices for our components products as compared to the prior year 
gross margins as a percentage of sales decreased to in as compared to in the decrease in gross margin was due to the increased percentage of low margin sales from our commercial segment in as compared to in addition  higher costs incurred in the medical segment for the transition of certain products to offshore manufacturers and the shipment of higher cost inventory built domestically negatively impacted gross margins

outlook issues and uncertainties the following issues and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating the company s future financial performance and prospects for growth 
we may continue to experience losses selling commercial products 
the market for our commercial products is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in prices and demand 
our failure to successfully manage inventory levels or quickly respond to changes in pricing  technology or consumer tastes and demand could result in lower than expected revenue  lower gross margin and excess and obsolete inventories of our commercial products which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
market conditions were characterized by rapid declines in end user pricing during part of such declines cause the company s inventory to lose value and trigger price protection obligations for channel inventory 
supply and pricing of lcd panels has been very volatile and will likely be in the future 
this volatility  combined with lead times of eight to twelve weeks  may cause us to pay too much for products or suffer inadequate product supply 
we do not have long term agreements with our resellers  who generally may terminate our relationship with to days notice 
such action by our resellers could substantially harm our operating results in this segment 
the commercial segment has seen tremendous growth since we entered the market in fiscal revenue from commercial products grew to million in fiscal  and decreased to million in fiscal this revenue could continue to decrease due to competition  alternative products  pricing changes in the market place and potential shortages of products which would adversely affect our revenue levels and our results of operations 
this segment absorbs a portion of the company s fixed costs 
if this segment was discontinued or substantially reduced in size  it may not be possible to eliminate all of the fixed overhead costs that are allocated to the segment 
if that were the case  a portion of the allocated fixed costs would have to be absorbed by the other two segments  potentially adversely affecting our overall financial performance 
shortages of components and materials may delay or reduce our sales and increase our costs 
inability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and other materials necessary to produce our displays could result in reduced or delayed sales 
we obtain much of the material we use in the manufacture of our displays from a limited number of suppliers  and we do not have long term supply contracts with any of them 
for some of this material we do not have a guaranteed alternative source of supply 
as a result  we are subject to cost fluctuations  supply interruptions and difficulties in obtaining materials 
the company has in the past and may in the future face difficulties ensuring an adequate supply of quality high resolution glass used in its medical displays 
we are continually engaged in efforts to address this risk area 
for most of our products  vendor lead times significantly exceed our customers required delivery time causing us to order to forecast rather than order based on actual demand 
competition in the market continues to reduce the period of time customers will wait for product delivery 
ordering raw material and building finished goods based on our forecast exposes the company to numerous risks including our inability to service customer demand in an acceptable timeframe  holding excess and obsolete inventory or having unabsorbed manufacturing overhead 
we have increased our reliance on asian manufacturing companies for the manufacture of displays that we sell in all markets that the company serves 
we also rely on certain other contract manufacturing operations in asia  including those that produce circuit boards and other components  and those that manufacture and assemble certain of our products 
we do not have long term supply contracts with the asian contract manufacturers on which we rely 
if any of these asian manufacturers were to terminate its arrangements with us  make decisions to terminate production of these products  or become unable to provide these displays to us on a timely basis  we could be unable to sell our products until alternative manufacturing arrangements are made 
furthermore  there is no assurance that we would be able to establish replacement manufacturing or assembly arrangements and relationships on acceptable terms  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
our reliance on contract manufacturers involves certain risks  including  but not limited to lack of control over production capacity and delivery schedules  unanticipated interruptions in transportation and logistics  limited control over quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs  potential termination by our vendors of agreements to supply materials to us  which would necessitate our contracting of alternative suppliers  which may not be possible  risks associated with international commerce  including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements  foreign currency fluctuations and changes in tariffs  and trade policies and political and economic instability 
most of the contract manufacturers with which we do business are located in asia which has experienced several earthquakes  tsunamis and typhoons which resulted in business interruptions 
our business could suffer significantly if the operations of vendors there or elsewhere were disrupted for extended periods of time 
we currently have a contract with a software developer in india to develop software on our behalf 
we do not have a long term contract with this developer  and if the developer were to terminate its arrangement with us or become unable to provide software to us on a timely basis we could be unable to sell future products that this software would be integrated into 
the company must implement section  internal controls over financial reporting  of the sarbanes oxley act 
the fiscal year ending september  was the first year that our internal controls over financial reporting were audited by our independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of section 
guidance regarding implementation and interpretation of the provisions of section continues to be issued by the standards setting community 
as a result of the ongoing interpretation of new guidance and the audit testing to be completed in the future  our internal controls over financial reporting may include an unidentified material weakness which would result in receiving an adverse opinion on our internal controls over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm 
this could result in significant additional expenditures responding to the section internal control audit  heightened regulatory scrutiny and potentially an adverse effect to the price of our company s stock 
we face intense competition 
the market for display products is highly competitive  and we expect this to continue and even intensify 
we believe that over time this competition will have the effect of reducing average selling prices of our products 
certain of our competitors have substantially greater name recognition and financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
there is no assurance that our competitors will not succeed in developing or marketing products that would render our products obsolete or noncompetitive 
to the extent we are unable to compete effectively against our competitors  whether due to such practices or otherwise  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  both within and outside our control 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following our effectiveness in designing new product solutions  including those incorporating new technologies  our ability to anticipate and address the needs of our customers  the quality  performance  reliability  features  ease of use  pricing and diversity of our product solutions  foreign currency fluctuations  which may cause competitors products to be priced significantly lower than our product solutions  the quality of our customer services  the effectiveness of our supply chain management  our ability to identify new vertical markets and develop attractive products for them  our ability to develop and maintain effective sales channels  the rate at which customers incorporate our product solutions into their own products  and product or technology introductions by our competitors 
our continued success depends on the development of new products and technologies 
future results of operations will partly depend on our ability to improve and market our existing products and to successfully develop and market new products 
failing this  our products or technology could become obsolete or noncompetitive 
new products and markets  by their nature  present significant risks and even if we are successful in developing new products  they typically result in pressure on gross margins during the initial phases as start up activities are spread over lower initial sales volumes 
we have experienced lower margins from new products and processes in the past  which have negatively impacted overall gross margins 
in addition  customer relationships can be negatively impacted due to production problems and late delivery of shipments 
future operating results will depend on our ability to continue to provide new product solutions that compare favorably on the basis of cost and performance with competitors 
our success in attracting new customers and developing new business depends on various factors  including  but not limited to  the following use of advances in technology  innovative development of products for new markets  efficient and cost effective services  timely completion of the design and manufacture of new product solutions  and software currently being developed on our behalf by a software developer located in india 
our efforts to develop new technologies may not result in commercial success 
our research and development efforts with respect to new technologies may not result in market acceptance 
some or all of those technologies may not successfully make the transition from the research and development lab to cost effective production as a result of technology problems  cost issues  yield problems and other factors 
even when we successfully complete a research and development effort with respect to a particular technology  we may fail to gain market acceptance due to inadequate access to sales channels  superior products developed by our competitors  price considerations  ineffective market promotions and marketing programs  and lack of market demand for the products 
we face risks associated with international operations 
our manufacturing  sales and distribution operations in europe and asia create a number of logistical and communications challenges 
our international operations also expose us to various economic  political and other risks  including  but not limited to  the following management of a multi national organization  compliance with local laws and regulatory requirements as well as changes in those laws and requirements  employment and severance issues  overlap of tax issues  tariffs and duties  employee turnover or labor unrest  lack of developed infrastructure  difficulties protecting intellectual property  risks associated with outbreaks of infectious diseases  the burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws  and political or economic instability in certain parts of the world 
changes in policies by the united states or foreign governments resulting in  among other things  increased duties  higher taxation  currency conversion limitations  restrictions on the transfer or repatriation of funds  limitations on imports or exports  changes in environmental standards or regulations  or the expropriation of private enterprises also could have a materially adverse effect 
any actions by our host countries to curtail or reverse policies that encourage foreign investment or foreign trade also could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  us trade policies  such as most favored nation status and trade preferences for certain asian nations  could affect the attractiveness of our services to our us customers 
variability of customer requirements or losses of key customers may adversely affect our operating results 
we must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround and respond to ever shorter lead times  while at the same time meet our customers product specifications and quality expectations 
a variety of conditions  both specific to individual customers and generally affecting the demand for their products  may cause customers to cancel  reduce  or delay orders 
these actions by a significant customer or by a set of customers could adversely affect our business 
on occasion  customers require rapid increases in production  which can strain our resources and reduce our margins 
we may lack sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers demands 
products sold to two customers comprised and and to one customer comprised of total consolidated sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
sales to any of those customers  if lost  would have a material  adverse impact on the results of operations 
if accounts receivable from a significant customer or set of customers became uncollectible  a resulting charge could have a material  adverse effect on our operations  although the company does maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
we do not have long term purchase commitments from our customers 
with the exception of the industrial segment  our business is generally characterized by short term purchase orders 
we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand which rely in part on nonbinding forecasts provided by our customers 
as a result  our backlog generally does not exceed three months  which makes forecasting our sales difficult 
inaccuracies in our forecast as a result of changes in customer demand or otherwise may result in our inability to service customer demand in an acceptable timeframe  our holding excess and obsolete inventory or having unabsorbed manufacturing overhead 
the failure to obtain anticipated orders and deferrals or cancellations of purchase commitments because of changes in customer requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have experienced such problems in the past and may experience such problems in the future 
our operating results have significant fluctuations 
in addition to the variability resulting from the short term nature of our customers commitments  other factors contribute to significant periodic quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following the timing of orders  the volume of orders relative to our capacity  product introductions and market acceptance of new products or new generations of products  evolution in the lifecycles of customers products  changes in cost and availability of labor and components  product mix  variation in operating expenses  pricing and availability of competitive products and services  and changes or anticipated changes in economic conditions 
accordingly  the results of any past periods should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 
it is likely that  in some future period  our operating results may be below expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if this occurs  our stock price may decrease 
we must continue to add value to our portfolio of offerings 
traditional display components are subject to increasing competition to the point of commodification 
in addition  advances in core lcd technology makes standard displays effective in an increasing breadth of applications 
we must add additional value to our products in software and services for which customers are willing to pay 
these areas have not been a significant part of our business in the past and we may not execute well in the future 
failure to do so could adversely affect our revenue levels and our results of operations 
we must protect our intellectual property  and others could infringe on or misappropriate our rights 
we believe that our continued success partly depends on protecting our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property 
we seek to protect some of our technology under trade secret laws  which afford only limited protection 
we face risks associated with our intellectual property  including  but not limited to  the following pending patent and copyright applications may not be issued  patent and copyright applications are filed only in limited countries  intellectual property laws may not protect our intellectual property rights  others may challenge  invalidate  or circumvent any patent or copyright issued to us  rights granted under patents or copyrights issued to us may not provide competitive advantages to us  unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  and others may independently develop similar technology or design around any patents issued to us 
we may find it necessary to take legal action in the future to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims of infringement 
litigation can be very expensive and can distract our management s time and attention  which could adversely affect our business 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain a favorable outcome in any intellectual property litigation 
others could claim that we are infringing their patents or other intellectual property rights 
in the event of an allegation that we are infringing on another s rights  we may not be able to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms from that party  if at all  or that party may commence litigation against us 
the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or the institution of litigation arising out of such claims could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we currently have a contract with a software developer in india to develop software on our behalf 
any software developed by them on our behalf could be subject to patent infringement by others 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations 
during the past four fiscal quarters  the closing price of our stock ranged from to 
the market price of our common stock in the future is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors  including  but not limited to  the following variations in our operating results  public announcements by the company as to its expectations of future sales and net income  actual or anticipated announcements of technical innovations or new product developments by us or our competitors  changes in analysts estimates of our financial performance  general conditions in the electronics industry  and worldwide economic and financial conditions 
in addition  the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for many technology companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations and other factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
products aimed at retail establishments may not result in commercial success 
our retailing initiatives are focused on an emerging market for customer facing displays which are used to interact with and inform customers in retail establishments 
this emerging market has had and will likely continue to have changing requirements 
our inability to meet these requirements could have an adverse effect on the commercial success of these initiatives 
in addition  the market for retail products has been characterized by long sales cycles and may continue to be in the future 
participation in the retail market requires significant up front investment with no guarantee of future profitability 
a significant slowdown in the demand for our customers products would adversely affect our business 
in portions of our medical and industrial segments  we design and manufacture display solutions that our customers incorporate into their products 
as a result  our success partly depends upon the market acceptance of our customers products 
accordingly  we must identify industries that have significant growth potential and establish relationships with customers who are successful in those industries 
failure to identify potential growth opportunities or establish relationships with customers in those industries would adversely affect our business 
dependence on the success of our customers products exposes us to a variety of risks  including  but not limited to  the following our ability to match our design and manufacturing capacity with customer demand and to maintain satisfactory delivery schedules  customer order patterns  changes in order mix and the level and timing of orders that we can manufacture and ship in a quarter  and the cyclical nature of the industries and markets our customers serve 
these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must maintain satisfactory manufacturing yields and capacity 
an inability to maintain sufficient levels of productivity or to satisfy delivery schedules at our manufacturing facilities would adversely affect our operating results 
the design and manufacture of our el displays involves highly complex processes that are sensitive to a wide variety of factors  including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  impurities in the materials used and the performance of personnel and equipment 
at times we have experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields and lengthened delivery schedules and may experience such problems in the future  particularly with respect to new products or technologies 
any such problems could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot provide any assurance that current environmental laws and product quality specification standards  or any laws or standards enacted in the future  will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
our operations are subject to environmental and product quality regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
some of our products use substances  such as lead  that are highly regulated or will not be allowed in certain jurisdictions in the future 
if we cannot remove such substances from our products  we may be unable to sell our products in such jurisdictions 
we are currently redesigning certain products and working with our vendors to eliminate such substances in our products 
in addition  regulations have been enacted in certain states which impose restrictions on waste disposal in the future 
if we do not comply with applicable rules and regulations in connection with the use and disposal of such substances  we could be subject to significant liability or loss of future sales 
additionally  the european union and certain european and other countries have established independent standards for certain medical products  including radiological imaging products  that are different from  and in some cases more restrictive than  the us standards 
if we are unable to comply with these regulations or standards  or if other countries establish such regulations or standards with which we are unable to comply  we may not be allowed to sell our digital imaging or other products within the european union and in other such countries 
if the company has inventory  upon full enactment of the standards and regulations  which becomes unsaleable due to its composition  a charge for inventory obsolescence could result 
el products are manufactured at a single location  with no currently available substitute location 
our el products  which are based on proprietary technology  are produced in our manufacturing facility located in espoo  finland 
because the el technology and manufacturing process is proprietary and unique  there exists no alternative location where it may be produced  either by the company  or by another manufacturer 
as such  loss of or damage to the manufacturing facility  or attrition in the facility s skilled workforce  could cause a disruption in the manufacturing of the el products  which compose a significant portion of our sales 
additionally  there are many fixed costs associated with such a manufacturing facility 
if revenue levels were to decrease or other problems were encountered  this could have a material  adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the value of intangible assets and goodwill may become impaired in the future 
the company has intangible assets recorded on the balance sheet  which relate primarily to developed technology 
the value of intangible assets represents our estimate of the net present value of future cash flows which can be derived from the developed technology over time  and is amortized over the estimated useful life of the underlying assets 
the estimated future cash flows of the intangible assets are evaluated on a regular basis  and if it becomes apparent that these estimates will not be met  a reduction in the value of intangible assets will be required 
in addition  goodwill has been recorded which relates primarily to the medical segment 
goodwill is not amortized  but is evaluated annually  or when indicators of potential impairment exist 
if the expected future cash flows related to the medical segment decline  a reduction in the value of goodwill will be required  such as the reduction in value incurred in the fourth quarter of loss of key employees could adversely affect our business 
we depend on the services of certain employees with unique technical skills  many of whom do not have other employees with redundant skills backing them up 
the loss of any of these key employees could adversely affect our business 
future viability of the manufacturing facility located in espoo  finland is based on continued demand for el products 
the majority of the products manufactured at the company s facility located in espoo  finland are based on el technology 
if demand for el technology based products diminishes significantly in the future  it could become necessary to cease manufacturing operations at this facility  which would likely result in an impairment loss on the associated property  plant and equipment  and restructuring charges related to employee severance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its investment portfolio and short term and long term debt obligations 
the company mitigates its risk by diversifying its investments among high credit quality securities in accordance with the company s investment policy 
the company believes that its net income or cash flow exposure relating to rate changes for short term and long term debt obligations are not material 
the company primarily enters into debt obligations to support acquisitions  capital expenditures and working capital needs 
the company does not hedge any interest rate exposures 
interest expense is affected by the general level of u 
s 
interest rates and or libor 
increases in interest expense resulting from an increase in interest rates would be at least partially offset by a corresponding increase in interest earned on the company s investments 
the euro is the functional currency of the company s subsidiary in finland 
the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in the us dollar to euro exchange rate 
the forward exchange contracts are settled and renewed on a monthly basis in order to maintain a balance between the balance sheet exposures and the contract amounts 
the company maintained an open contract of approximately million at september  if rates shifted dramatically  the company believes it would not be materially impacted 
in addition  the company does maintain cash balances denominated in currencies other than the u 
s 
dollar 
if foreign exchange rates were to weaken against the u 
s 
dollar  the company believes that the fair value of these foreign currency amounts would not decline by a material amount
