forward looking statements include those statements containing words such as the following will  should  could  anticipate  believe  plan  estimate  expect  intend  and other similar expressions 
all of these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
they are all made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of we wish to caution you that our actual results may differ significantly from the results we discuss in our forward looking statements 
we discuss the risks that could cause such differences in exhibit to this report incorporated by reference into this form k  and in our various other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
our forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this document  and we do not intend to update these statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after that date 
general martek was founded in we are a leader in the development and commercialization of products derived from microalgae and other microbes 
our leading products are nutritional oils used as ingredients in infant formula and foods and as ingredients in  and encapsulated for use as  dietary supplements 
our nutritional oils are comprised of fatty acid components  primarily docosahexaenoic acid  commonly known as dha  and arachidonic acid  commonly known as ara 
many researchers believe that these fatty acids may enhance mental and visual development in infants  may play a pivotal role in brain function throughout life and may reduce risks associated with coronary heart disease 
low levels of dha in adults have also been linked with a variety of health risks 
research is underway to assess what impact  if any  supplementation with our dha will have on these health risks 
additional applications of our patented technology based upon microalgae include our currently marketed fluorescent detection products that can be used by researchers as an aid in drug discovery and diagnostics 
in  we realized our first revenues from license fees related to our nutritional oils containing dha and ara and sales of sample quantities of these oils 
in  we recognized our first product and royalty revenues from sales of infant formula containing these oils  and in we began to realize revenues from the sale of neuromins  a dha dietary supplement 
in  we first realized revenues from the sale of our fluorescent detection products 
we currently have license agreements with sixteen infant formula manufacturers  including mead johnson nutritionals  wyeth  abbott laboratories  nestle  royal numico nv formerly nutricia  novartis  maabarot  heinz wattie s  laboratorios ordesa  american st 
george biological corporation  international nutrition company  pt sanghiang perkasa  takaso rubber and three companies whose identities we have agreed not to disclose at this time 
collectively  these companies represent approximately of the estimated to billion worldwide wholesale market for infant formula and nearly of the estimated to billion us wholesale market for infant formula  including the wholesale value of women  infant children program wic rebates 
wic is a federal grant program administered by the states for the benefit of low income  nutritionally at risk women  infants and children 
our licensees are now selling term infant formula products containing our oils collectively in over countries and pre term infant formula products containing our oils collectively in over countries around the world 
supplemented term infant formulas manufactured by mead johnson nutritionals  abbott laboratories  wyeth and nestle are currently being sold in the united states 
in april  we acquired omegatech  inc omegatech or martek boulder  a low cost algal dha producer located in boulder  colorado 
omegatech had been in the fermentable dha business since  and had accumulated over issued and pending patents protecting its dha technology 
its revenues mainly consisted of sales of dha into the dietary supplement  food  beverage  and animal feed markets 
we acquired omegatech to obtain its low cost dha oil and related intellectual property for use in the adult supplements market and future use in the food and beverage markets 
in june  the australia new zealand food standards council authorized the use of dha s oil for use as a novel food ingredient in australia and new zealand 
in june  the commission of the european communities authorized the use of our dha s oil and declared that our dha s oil may be sold in the european community as a novel food ingredient 
this novel food designation authorizes the use of our dha s as an ingredient in certain foods such as certain dairy products  including cheese and yogurt but not milk based drinks  spreads and dressings  breakfast cereals  food supplements and dietary foods for special medical purposes in the european community 
in february  the fda completed a favorable review of our gras notification for the use of dha s in food and beverage applications 
we are currently selling dha s products into the nutritional supplements  food and beverage and animal feed markets domestically and internationally 
in september  we purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of fermpro manufacturing  lp  which operated a fermentation facility located in kingstree  south carolina 
fermpro provided contract fermentation services and had an experienced workforce of over personnel on a site of over acres with extensive fermentation  recovery  laboratory and warehousing capabilities 
the addition of the fermpro facility and workforce has enabled us to expand our production capabilities using the existing facility  coupled with the extensive construction build out and employee build up that are currently nearing completion 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  several new products were launched which contained martek dha 
specifically  mead johnson launched a dha supplement for pregnant and nursing women containing martek dha 
this product  expecta tm lipil  extends mead johnson s use of martek dha beyond infant formula and responds to the growing body of evidence suggesting both mothers and their babies benefit from an adequate maternal intake of dha 
in addition  pbm products announced the launch of the first beverage containing martek dha that is formulated for diabetics and people with abnormal glucose tolerance 
finally  glaxosmithkline launched a second powdered drink mix containing martek dha in india 
the product  junior horlicks  is specially formulated for a child s developing brain and nervous system and is available in selected outlets in south and east india 
all of these products are expected to generate additional revenue for us during fiscal prior to fiscal  we incurred losses in each year since our inception 
for the year ended october   we recognized approximately million in net income and as of october   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
although we anticipate significant continued growth in sales of our nutritional oils  and we achieved an operating profit in fiscal and  we may continue to experience quarter to quarter and year to year fluctuations in our future operating results  some of which may be significant 
the timing and extent of such fluctuations will depend  in part  on the timing and receipt of oils related revenues 
the extent and timing of future oils related revenues are largely dependent upon the following factors the ability by us and our third party manufacturers to produce adequate levels of our nutritional oils  the timing of the completion of construction at our kingstree facility and related expanded production capabilities  the timing and extent of production and production expansion by dsm at its facilities  the timing of infant formula market introductions by our licensees  the timing and extent of introductions of dha into various child and or adult applications  the timing and extent of acceptance of products containing our oils under state administered reimbursement programs in the us  the acceptance of these products by consumers  our ability to protect against competitive products through our patents  competition from alternative sources of dha and ara  and agreements with other future third party collaborators to market our products or develop new products 
as such  the likelihood  timing and extent of future profitability are largely dependent on factors such as those mentioned above  as well as others  over which we have limited or no control 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  which are based on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and  as such  actual results may differ from our estimates 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations our business acquisitions of fermpro and omegatech were accounted for using the purchase method 
the purchase method requires us to allocate the cost of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 
in performing the purchase price allocations  we utilized both internal discounted cash flow analyses and third party appraisals to determine the value of acquired assets and liabilities 
such valuations require significant estimates and assumptions  including  but not limited to  estimating future cash flows from contracts and products and developing appropriate discount rates 
the valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the future operating results of the company 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill long lived assets  including fixed assets  goodwill and other intangibles  are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
for goodwill  an assessment is made at least annually 
discounted cash flow or fair value analyses are used to assess goodwill impairment  while undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to assess other long lived asset impairment 
the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance 
while management believes that its projections are reasonable and that no impairment of these assets exists  different assumptions could affect these evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of these assets 
revenue recognition we derive revenue principally from two sources product sales and contract manufacturing 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
typical infant formula license contracts include an upfront license fee  a prepayment of product sales and established pricing on future product sales 
in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  the consideration from these contracts is allocated based on the relative fair values of the separate elements 
revenue is recognized on product sales when goods are shipped 
cash received as a prepayment on future product purchases is deferred and recognized as revenue when product is shipped 
revenue from product licenses is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
royalty income is recorded when earned  based on information provided by our licensees 
contract manufacturing revenue is recognized when goods are shipped to customers and all other conditions for revenue recognition are met 
cash received that is related to future performance under such contracts is deferred and recognized as revenue when earned 
deferred income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we also recognize deferred tax assets for certain tax net operating loss carryforwards 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such amounts are expected to reverse or be utilized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income 
when appropriate  we recognize a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
the calculation of deferred tax assets including valuation allowances and liabilities requires management to apply significant judgment related to such factors as the application of complex tax laws  changes in tax laws and the future operations of the company 
we review our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required based upon these factors 
changes in our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance could give rise to a change in such allowance  potentially resulting in additional expense or benefit in the period of change 
stock based compensation we account for employee stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations  which require us to recognize compensation cost for the excess of the fair value of the stock at the grant date over the exercise price  if any 
an alternative method of accounting would apply the principles of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  which require the fair value of the stock option to be recognized at the date of grant and amortized to compensation expense over the stock option s vesting period 
no stock based employee compensation cost for stock options is reflected in net income  as all options granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
stock based compensation for non employees is accounted for using the fair value based method in accordance with sfas see recently issued accounting pronouncements 
management outlook we believe that the outlook for future revenue growth remains positive  although quarterly results may show fluctuations  particularly if we experience unforeseen variances in production 
specifically  we believe that for fiscal  current term infant formula products containing our oils will continue to gain market share in existing markets  new products will be added in those markets  and term infant formulas containing our oils will also be introduced in additional countries 
as we have discussed  to date  twelve of our infant formula licensees are selling term infant formula products containing our oils collectively in over countries and pre term infant formula products containing our oils collectively in over countries around the world 
supplemented term infant formulas manufactured by four of our licensees are currently being sold in the united states and we expect these sales to increase in fiscal in fiscal  over of our product sales revenues related to the sales of our oils for use in infant formula and recently introduced toddler products 
we anticipate increased future sales of our oils for other products such as products developed for pregnant and nursing mothers  cardiovascular health  and the food and beverage market 
we expect that the majority of these sales will come through partnering relationships with larger companies in the nutritional and food and beverage markets 
we anticipate that over the next few years these sales will expand and represent a much larger potential market than infant formula 
we have an aggressive growth plan that includes substantial additional investments in our manufacturing facilities 
to accommodate our growth plan  we will need to continue to improve our operational and financial information systems and controls  expand our management team  continue to attract and retain new employees  accurately anticipate demand for our products and effectively bring on line and integrate new production capacity 
in addition  we will rely on third party manufacturers to effectively bring on line and integrate new production capacity 
all of these factors present numerous challenges and could result in unanticipated costs and delays in product manufacture 
production since fiscal  the demand for our nutritional oils for use in infant formula products has significantly exceeded production capacity 
these shortfalls have resulted from an acceleration of such demand over what our customers had projected coupled with a shortage of ara production capacity from dsm that began in the first quarter of fiscal as customer demand has increased  we have requested that our customers provide us with longer lead times in order to fill their orders 
even with the longer lead times and increased production each quarter  we continue to limit the orders we accept for our nutritional oils 
we manufacture oils rich in dha at our fermentation and oil processing facilities located in winchester  kentucky and kingstree  south carolina 
we are nearing completion of an extensive expansion at our kingstree facility 
certain components of the initial phase of the expansion  including the first fermentation area  commenced commercial operation during the last six months of fiscal the second expansion phase is expected to commence commercial operation in the second quarter of fiscal our ara oils have historically been purchased from dsm as manufactured at its capua  italy plant 
during fiscal  dsm added production capacity in the us by converting existing facilities in belvidere  new jersey to the production of ara 
in june  dsm restarted the production line at the belvidere facility after a shutdown relating to a fire incident in may since that time  belvidere has continued to increase its monthly output of ara 
dsm is currently expanding its ara production capabilities at both facilities 
we are now receiving approximately of our ara from dsm s belvidere facility with that percentage expected to grow to approximately as dsm completes its current expansion at belvidere  in phases  over the next to months 
as part of the april agreement with dsm  we are required to guarantee the recovery to dsm of certain expansion costs incurred by them 
this guarantee  which currently relates to dsm s recent belvidere expansion  will decline in value as we purchase ara from dsm in the future 
as of october   the value of our current guarantee to dsm is approximately million 
in addition  we are in the process of negotiating an amendment to the april agreement with dsm 
this amendment is expected to establish the overall economics associated with dsm s current expansions at both facilities  including our guarantee of such expansion costs 
because dsm is a third party manufacturer  we do not have full control over the timing and extent of its capua and belvidere production volumes 
we have attempted to reduce the risk inherent in having a single supplier  such as dsm  through certain elements of a new supply agreement entered into with dsm in april in connection with the new agreement  we have licensed the dsm technology associated with ara production 
through this license and the overall supply arrangement  we have the ability to produce  either directly or through another third party  an unlimited amount of ara 
the sale of such self produced ara is limited annually  however  to the greater of i tons of ara oil or ii any amounts ordered by us that dsm is unable to fulfill 
we anticipate being capable of producing ara and having it available for future sale by the end of the second quarter of fiscal to further reduce our ara production risk  we have directly engaged and recently added a new us based provider of certain post fermentation ara manufacturing services 
historically  these services had been provided by two european vendors through dsm 
along with existing ara extraction capabilities at winchester and our pending ara extraction capabilities at kingstree  which we anticipate being available by the second quarter of fiscal  the addition of a new third party facility will give us multiple us sites for the downstream processing of ara 
when combining our current and projected dha production capabilities in winchester and kingstree with dsm s current and projected ara production capabilities in italy and the us  we had total production capacity equivalent to between and million in annualized sales of our nutritional oils at the end of fiscal capacity is expected to increase each month throughout fiscal and we expect to have production capacity equivalent to approximately million in annualized sales of our nutritional oils during the second half of fiscal based on current prices 
due to customer acceptance and qualification requirements  there is a gap of approximately three months between production capacity increases and potential sales increases 
a portion of this capacity is reserved for future production of dha s 
we also believe that production optimization efforts will continue at our plants for the next several years as new technologies and additional algal strains are tested to further increase output and reduce costs 
if  however  the production expansion in kingstree does not proceed as planned or if dsm is not able to further expand its ara production capacity in the us  our ability to produce at these levels may be negatively impacted 
to meet demand in excess of these levels  we will need to do one or more of the following further expand our production facilities in winchester and kingstree  build another production facility to manufacture our oils  or enter into additional agreements with third party manufacturers to produce our oils 
we also have several other contractual agreements with third party manufacturers to assist in the production of our nutritional oils 
most significantly  we have a production agreement with cp kelco cp inc cp kelco that we assumed with the purchase of omegatech for the production of dha s biomass that we sell to animal feed companies or process further for use in the adult supplement and food and beverage markets 
we currently have a minimum purchase commitment with cp kelco that expires on june  with possible annual renewals 
as of october   our remaining obligation was approximately million 
the commercial success of our nutritional oils will depend  in part  on our ability to manufacture these oils or have them manufactured at large scale and at a commercially acceptable cost 
if the production expansion plans of martek or dsm do not proceed as anticipated or if market demand subsides due to our inability to meet demand for our products  our results could be negatively impacted 
there can also be no assurance that we will be able to successfully optimize production of our nutritional oils  or continue to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  including gmp requirements 
under the terms of several of our infant formula licenses  our licensees may elect to manufacture these oils themselves 
we are currently unaware of any of our licensees producing our oils or preparing to produce our oils  and estimate that it would take a licensee at least one year or more to implement our process of making our oils 
acquisitions and dispositions in september  we purchased  through a wholly owned subsidiary  certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of fermpro  which operated a fermentation facility located in kingstree  south carolina 
the addition of the fermpro facility added to our production capabilities and has allowed us to establish a second manufacturing facility with redundant capabilities 
the purchase price of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed included a payment of approximately million  comprised of million in cash   shares of our common stock valued at approximately million  and approximately million in acquisition related fees and expenses 
in addition  a million note was assumed as part of the transaction 
the results of operations of fermpro have been included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations from the date of the acquisition 
the purchase price has been allocated to the assumed assets and liabilities of fermpro based on their relative fair values 
in april  we completed our acquisition of omegatech for approximately million 
approximately million of the purchase price was related to the value of  shares of our common stock million of which related to omegatech transaction costs paid by us  approximately million was for our acquisition related fees and expenses  and approximately million was related to the fair value of  vested omegatech stock options that were assumed as part of the transaction 
the merger agreement also provides for additional stock consideration of up to million  subject to certain pricing adjustments  if certain milestones are met 
two of these milestones relate to operating results sales and gross profit margin objectives by october and october and two relate to regulatory approvals in the us and europe 
one of the regulatory approval milestones related to the granting of novel foods approval in europe for the omegatech dha s oil 
in june  the commission of the european community granted approval of the use of this oil in certain foods in europe  meeting the conditions of this regulatory milestone 
accordingly  approximately  shares of martek common stock  with a fair market value of approximately million  were issued during the third quarter of fiscal the payment of this additional consideration was recorded as goodwill 
as of october   we do not believe the second regulatory milestone has been achieved 
in addition  we do not believe that either financial milestone related to sales and gross profit margin for the periods ended october  and has been achieved 
the representative of the former omegatech stockholders has advised us that he believes that the common stock issuable with respect to the second regulatory milestone as well as the financial milestone related to the period ended october  should be issued 
martek disagrees with that conclusion 
as discussed in item of part i of this form k  legal proceedings  we are currently involved in litigation to resolve this dispute with respect to the second regulatory milestone 
the total martek common stock that may be issued relating to the three remaining milestones is subject to a formula that is based on the average market price of our stock on the dates that the individual milestones are determined to have been achieved  up to a maximum of million shares 
any contingent consideration paid related to these milestones would be recorded as goodwill 
the results of operations of omegatech have been included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations from the date of the acquisition 
the purchase price has been allocated to the assets and liabilities of omegatech based on their relative fair values 
as part of the omegatech purchase price allocation  we allocated approximately million of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
this allocation represented the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows pertaining to the incomplete research and development related primarily to two projects 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  the acquired in process research and development was charged to expense as of the date of the merger 
results of operations revenues the following table presents revenues by category in thousands year ended october  product sales contract manufacturing sales total revenues product sales increased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a continued increased in sales of our oils to both existing and new infant formula licensees 
substantially all of our product sales in fiscal relate to the sale of our oils for use in infant formulas 
approximately of our fiscal product sales revenue was generated by sales to mead johnson nutritionals  was generated by sales to abbott laboratories and was generated by sales to wyeth 
collectively  these three companies and nestle are currently manufacturing term infant formulas supplemented with our oils for sale in the us  and in over countries around the world 
although we are not given precise information by our customers as to the countries in which infant formula containing our oils is ultimately sold  we estimate that approximately two thirds of our sales to infant formula licensees for the year ended october  relates to sales in the us the first infant formulas containing our oils were introduced in the us in february and  as of october   formula supplemented with our oils had gained more than a penetration in the us infant formula market 
product sales increased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to increased sales of our oils to infant formula licensees 
approximately of our fiscal revenue was generated by sales to mead johnson and was generated by sales of dha and ara to wyeth  abbott and nestle combined 
we anticipate product sales will continue to grow as infant formulas containing our oils are introduced by new licensees and by current licensees in additional countries 
we also anticipate that sales of our products will continue to grow in countries where our products are currently sold 
our future sales growth  however  is dependent upon our ability to expand our production capabilities at our kingstree facility and the ability of dsm to continue to expand production of ara at their belvidere  new jersey and capua  italy facilities 
contract manufacturing sales revenues  totaling approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively  relate to fermentation work performed for various third parties at the kingstree  south carolina facility  which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal contract manufacturing sales are expected to decrease in the future as this business is mostly phased out over the next few years to allow for increased fermentation capacity for our dha and ara production 
as a result of the above  total revenues increased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal and increased million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal cost and expenses the following table presents our operating costs and expenses in thousands year ended october  cost of revenue cost of product sales cost of contract manufacturing sales operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative other operating expenses restructuring charge acquired in process research and development total costs and expenses cost of product sales during fiscal  we continued to satisfy as much customer demand as possible  while  at times  sacrificing cost efficiencies 
as such  our cost of product sales increased as a percentage of product sales to in the year ended october  from in the year ended october  the increases resulted from our continued use of air freight in connection with ara shipments from europe an increase of approximately in cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales and internal production inefficiencies in connection with the commencement of dha manufacturing at the kingstree plant an increase of approximately in cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales 
the gross profit margins were also impacted by an increase in our overall cost of ara due to the decline of the us dollar against the euro  the currency in which we are required to pay dsm for their supply of ara from italy an increase of approximately in cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales 
such increases  however  were partially offset by the benefits of certain dha production improvements recently developed a decrease of approximately in cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales  savings from the introduction of lower cost ara from dsm s belvidere facility a decrease of approximately in cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales and insurance receipts by us associated with incidents at dsm production plants which served to offset some increased cost related to those incidents and decrease cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales by approximately for the fiscal year 
we expect our gross profit margins to continue to reflect the benefits of the newly implemented dha production improvements and expect the impact of certain negative factors noted above to be mitigated in fiscal as we continue to source more dha domestically and complete the kingstree expansion 
our cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales improved during fiscal compared to fiscal  decreasing to from 
this was due primarily to lower ara costs from dsm  our third party supplier of ara  due to efficiencies realized from increased sales volume  partially offset by unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and the us dollar 
cost of contract manufacturing sales costs of contract manufacturing sales  totaling million and million for the years ended october  and  respectively  are the costs related to the fermentation work performed for various third parties at our kingstree  south carolina facility  which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal our contract manufacturing sales achieve significantly lower gross margins than our product sales 
contract manufacturing sales are to be mostly phased out over the next few years as the associated contracts expire 
this will allow for increased fermentation capacity for our dha and ara production 
research and development our research and development costs increased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increases are primarily the result of additional resources directed toward improving the quality and stability of our products  lowering our dha production cost by increasing our fermentation production yields and developing new downstream processing techniques 
the increases are also due to the commencement of new development projects  including development of ara fermentation methods  development of dha products for the food and beverage industry  exploration of new dha applications and long term development of plant based dha under the collaboration agreement with sembiosys 
approximately of the million in research and development expenditures incurred in fiscal related to research conducted in our columbia  maryland laboratory directed toward improving the quality  sensory properties and stability of our nutritional oils  optimizing production characteristics of microalgal strains  investigating the clinical health benefits of dha and ara fatty acids  and exploring the biochemical pathways utilized by microalgae to produce dha 
additional research and development expenses incurred at our winchester  kentucky facility were directed toward increasing our dha production yields  reducing waste  continuing to improve the quality of our oils and developing ara fermentation methods 
research conducted at our laboratory in boulder  colorado is focused on developing feasible approaches to the expression of nutritional fatty acids  especially dha  in plant oilseeds  investigating the feasibility of utilizing our proprietary genes to produce other bioactive compounds with application in the healthcare fields and developing new ingredient forms and applications technology for dha enriched food products 
our research and development costs increased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily the result of new development projects  including research directed toward improving the quality and stability of our products and research related to increasing our production yields and reducing waste at our manufacturing facilities 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative costs increased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal of the increase  approximately million relates to the addition of the kingstree  south carolina plant acquired in september  for which the administrative infrastructure was assumed and supports the new facility and its expansion 
the remaining increase is primarily due to additional personnel million and increased insurance costs million required to manage our overall growth 
specifically  we have increased staffing in our business development  food and beverage sales and marketing and finance departments 
our selling  general and administrative costs increased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase is primarily due to additional personnel million and increased legal fees and insurance costs million required to manage our overall growth 
other operating expenses we incurred other operating expenses of million  million and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
these expenditures related primarily to production start up costs associated with the expansion at our kingstree facility in fiscal and our winchester facility in fiscal  which include training expenses and costs related to unsuccessful fermentation runs in connection with the scale up and validation of new equipment into the production process 
these also include qualification of certain third party manufacturers as well as expenses related to the winchester wastewater treatment matter 
in addition  in fiscal we incurred expenditures related to start up costs of additional ara capacity at dsm s capua  italy facility under the terms of our prior contract with dsm 
other operating expenses in fiscal were associated with evaluating and obtaining additional capacity for the production of our dha and ara oils  including costs associated with testing and validating the fermentation technology at fermpro 
restructuring in july  we announced a restructuring of our food and beverage sales and marketing efforts 
as part of this restructuring  eight employees and five consultants associated with food and beverage sales were terminated 
a one time operating charge of approximately million was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal to account for severance and other costs associated with this restructuring 
employee separation benefits of approximately  under the restructuring plan include severance  medical and other benefits 
other costs of the restructuring  totaling approximately  include consultant termination costs  idle office space and professional fees 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we reduced the liability for employee separation benefits related to severance costs due to changes in previous estimates 
additionally  we increased the restructuring liability related to other charges such as consultant termination fees and costs related to idle space 
the net result of the related adjustments to the restructuring liability was a reversal of  in the fiscal quarter ended january  as of october   approximately  has been paid in employee separation benefits and approximately  has been paid in other costs 
the remaining liability of approximately  at october  relates primarily to certain contractual liabilities as of the restructuring date 
other income  net our other income  net  decreased by  in fiscal as compared to fiscal and decreased by  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  due primarily to changes in interest income resulting from varying levels of cash on hand and changes in interest rates 
see liquidity and capital resources for further discussion of cash on hand 
income tax benefit as of october   we  for the first time in our history  generated three years of cumulative operating profits 
as a result of this positive earnings trend and projected operating results over the next five years  we reversed approximately million of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance  having now determined that it is more likely than not that this portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
this reversal resulted in the recognition of an income tax benefit totaling million  a direct increase to stockholders equity of approximately million and a decrease to goodwill of approximately million 
although we will continue to have significant net operating loss carryforwards which are expected to mitigate some of our cash tax expenditures over the next several years  we will begin recording  in fiscal  a provision for income taxes based on the appropriate effective tax rate 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are also recognized for certain tax net operating loss carryforwards 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such amounts are expected to reverse or be utilized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income 
valuation allowances are provided to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
as of october   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
approximately million of this amount will expire  if unused  by the end of fiscal with the remainder expiring through fiscal of the total net operating loss carryforwards  approximately million continues to be fully reserved through a valuation allowance as realizability of these assets is uncertain at this time 
should realization of these and other deferred tax assets become more likely than not  approximately million of the resulting benefit will be reflected as an income tax benefit upon reversal of the allowance  approximately million will be reflected as a reduction to goodwill and approximately million will be reflected as an increase to stockholders equity 
net income loss as a result of the foregoing  net income was million in fiscal as compared to net income of million in fiscal and a net loss of million in fiscal in fiscal  million of the net loss was related to martek boulder  including the million charge for in process research and development and restructuring charges

it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and is otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   except for mandatory redeemable financial instruments of nonpublic entities 
the fasb has deferred implementation of sfas indefinitely for certain noncontrolling interests  the provisions of which are currently not applicable to us 
the adoption of sfas had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf 
eitf provides guidance on other than temporary impairment models for marketable debt and equity securities accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas  and non marketable equity securities accounted for under the cost method 
the eitf developed a basic three step model to evaluate whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
on september   the fasb issued fsp  effective date of paragraphs of eitf issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  delaying the effective date for the recognition and measurement guidance of eitf  as contained in paragraphs  until certain implementation issues are addressed and a final fsp providing implementation guidance is issued 
the disclosure requirements of the consensus remain in effect 
we do not expect the adoption of eitf s three step model to have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures for investments accounted for under sfas are effective for our fiscal year ended october  in october  the fasb concluded that sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which would require all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value  would be effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june  sfas r provides two tentative adoption methods 
the first method is a modified prospective transition method whereby a company would recognize share based employee costs from the beginning of the fiscal period in which the recognition provisions are first applied as if the fair value based accounting method had been used to account for all employee awards granted  modified  or settled after the effective date and to any awards that were not fully vested as of the effective date 
measurement and attribution of compensation cost for awards that are unvested as of the effective date of sfas r would be based on the same estimate of the grant date fair value and the same attribution method used previously under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
the second adoption method is a modified retrospective transition method whereby a company would recognize employee compensation cost for periods presented prior to the adoption of sfas r in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  that is  an entity would recognize employee compensation costs in the amounts reported in the pro forma disclosures provided in accordance with sfas a company would not be permitted to make any changes to those amounts upon adoption of sfas r unless those changes represent a correction of an error 
for periods after the date of adoption of sfas r  the modified prospective transition method described above would be applied 
we currently expect to adopt sfas r in the quarter ended october   using the modified prospective method  although we continue to review our options for adoption under this new pronouncement 
after giving effect to the accelerated vesting of certain stock options in december and january  described in note to the audited consolidated financial statements  and based upon our projection of unvested stock options at the implementation date from stock options granted and outstanding as of november   we expect the adoption to result in the recognition of additional compensation expense of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal and approximately million during fiscal in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs sfas 
sfas requires abnormal amounts of inventory costs related to idle facility  freight handling and wasted material expenses to be recognized as current period charges 
additionally  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we believe the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily from the following sources cash generated from operations  proceeds from the sale of equity securities  cash received from the exercise of stock options and warrants  and debt financing 
at october   our primary source of liquidity was our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million as well as the unused portion of our revolving credit facility of million 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased million from october  this decrease was primarily attributable to million in capital expenditures  the majority of which were related to the expansion of the kingstree facility to increase output of our nutritional oils 
these expenditures were offset by cash flow from operations of million  which was primarily the result of our profitability  partially offset by an increase of dha inventory which could not be blended with ara for sales to infant formula manufacturers because of a shortage of ara 
in addition  we generated cash flows from financing activities of million  primarily proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants and the issuance of common stock million and borrowings under our revolving credit facility million 
the expansion of our production facility in kingstree  south carolina and  to a lesser degree  production improvements at our facility in winchester  kentucky  have and will continue to have a material effect upon our liquidity and capital resources in fiscal we expect to invest approximately to million in fiscal in plant and equipment expenditures to complete the expansion and production improvements as well as for other company wide capital needs 
throughout the construction period  all interest incurred on borrowings will be capitalized to the extent that the borrowings are used to cover the balance of projects under construction 
in fiscal  we incurred interest on borrowings of approximately million and recorded amortization of related debt fees of approximately  all of the interest incurred and debt fee amortization recorded in fiscal was capitalized as part of the cost of our construction 
since our inception  we have raised approximately million from public and private sales of our equity securities  as well as from option and warrant exercises 
in fiscal  we achieved our first fiscal year of positive net income of approximately million 
including net income of million in fiscal  our accumulated deficit at october  is million 
the following table sets forth our future minimum payments under contractual obligations at october  less than more than total year years years years in thousands notes payable borrowings under revolving credit facility operating and capital lease obligations dsm license fee and other obligations unconditional inventory purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations does not include the minimum payments due under an operating lease for equipment at our kingstree facility entered in december as part of a sale leaseback transaction 
minimum payments under the lease are approximately  per month and the lease expires in october as part of the acquisition of fermpro  we assumed a million note with a stated interest rate of 
the note was amended in january and is now an unsecured obligation of the company with a maturity date of december  principal is amortized over a year period  with the balance due at maturity 
also as part of the fermpro acquisition  we assumed a long term note of approximately  due in with a stated interest rate 
in april  we entered into a new agreement with dsm extending the existing relationship between the two companies involving the production and supply of ara  one of our nutritional oils that we sell to our infant formula licensees 
among other things  this agreement provides for the sale to us by dsm of a license related to certain technologies associated with the manufacture of ara 
this sale involved a license fee totaling million  million of which was paid upon execution of the agreement  million of which was paid on november   and the remaining million of which will be paid on november  this agreement also provides for the guarantee by us of dsm s recovery of certain expansion costs incurred by them 
this guarantee  which currently relates to dsm s recent belvidere expansion  will decline in value as we purchase ara from dsm in the future 
as of october   the value of our current guarantee to dsm is approximately million 
in may  we entered into a million secured revolving credit facility which amended and expanded the million credit facility established in january the revolving credit facility is collateralized by accounts receivable and inventory and expires in february the weighted average interest rate on the credit facility was approximately for the year ended october  and is based on libor and our current leverage ratio 
among other things  the credit facility agreement contains restrictions on future debt  the payment of dividends and the further encumbrance of assets 
in addition  the credit facility requires that we comply with specified financial ratios and tests  including minimum liquidity  minimum coverage ratios and maximum leverage ratios 
we do not believe that these covenants restrict our ability to carry out our current business plan 
as of october   we are in compliance with all of these debt covenants and have borrowed million under the revolving credit facility 
in february  we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share pursuant to a shelf registration 
net proceeds to us  after deducting underwriters fees and expenses  amounted to approximately million 
the proceeds from this offering  together with funds on hand and borrowings under our bank credit facility  have been used to finance the expansion of our manufacturing capacity to meet increased demand for our dha and ara oils and for various general corporate purposes 
in august  our shelf registration statement was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission 
the shelf registration statement enables us to raise funds through the offering of debt securities  preferred stock  common stock and warrants  as well as any combination thereof  from time to time and through one or more methods of distribution  in an aggregate amount of up to million 
in october  we entered an operating lease for equipment at our kingstree facility as part of a sale leaseback transaction 
the equipment subject to lease was sold at its cost basis and fair value of million and simultaneously leased back to us 
the lease expires in october and contains the same restrictions as our revolving credit facility 
in december  we entered an operating lease for equipment at our kingstree facility subject to the same terms and expiration as part of a second sale leaseback transaction 
this equipment was sold at its cost basis and fair value of million 
we believe that the revolving credit facility  when combined with our cash and short term investments of million on hand at october   and anticipated operating cash flows  will provide us with adequate capital to meet our obligations for at least the next to months 
however  in order to address the possibility that additional production capacity may be needed to meet anticipated demand  or if we believe that our financial requirements otherwise warrant it  we expect to seek to raise more equity capital in the first quarter of the ultimate amount of additional funding that we may require will depend  among other things  on one or more of the following factors the cost of capital expenditures at our manufacturing facilities  growth in our infant formula  food and beverage and other nutritional product sales  the extent and progress of our research and development programs  the progress of pre clinical and clinical studies  the time and costs of obtaining and maintaining regulatory clearances for our products that are subject to such clearances  the costs involved in filing  protecting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  the cost of acquiring additional and or operating and expanding existing manufacturing facilities for our various products and potential products depending on which products we decide to manufacture and continue to manufacture ourselves  and the costs of marketing and commercializing our products 
we can offer no assurance that  if needed  any of our financing alternatives will be available to us on terms that would be acceptable  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements we have entered into lease agreements for certain laboratory and administrative space as well as manufacturing equipment with rental payments aggregating to million over the lease terms  which expire through included in these aggregate rentals are amounts related to certain equipment leases  for which we are contingently liable for a residual value guarantee of approximately million 
subsequent to october   we entered into an additional equipment lease which included aggregate rentals of million over the lease term and increased our residual value guarantee to a total of million 
as part of our agreement with dsm  we agreed to guarantee dsm s recovery of certain expansion costs incurred by them 
this guarantee  which currently relates to dsm s recent belvidere expansion  will decline in value as we purchase ara from dsm in the future 
as of october   the value of our current guarantee to dsm is approximately million we do not engage in any other off balance sheet financing arrangements 
in particular  we do not have any interest in entities referred to as variable interest entities  which include special purpose entities and structured finance entities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk beginning in january  purchases of ara from dsm s plant in capua  italy were denominated in euros  which exposes us to risks related to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro 
fluctuations between the us dollar and the euro will impact our cost of ara oil and gross margins 
we estimate that a change in the exchange rate would impact gross margins of our infant formula products by approximately 
our exposure to these currency fluctuations has begun to slightly decrease as dsm has now commenced ara production in the us at its belvidere  new jersey facility 
in april  we began entering into foreign currency cash flow hedges to reduce the related market risk 
we are subject to risk from adverse changes in interest rates  primarily relating to variable rate borrowings used to maintain liquidity and finance our manufacturing facility expansion 
based on our variable rate debt outstanding at october   a change in libor would change annual interest by  at october   the carrying amounts of debt approximate fair value
