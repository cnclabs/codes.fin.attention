item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation md a you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leading education company serving the prek education market by providing products  services and ideas that enhance student achievement and development to educators and schools across the united states and canada 
we offer more than  items through an innovative two pronged marketing approach that targets both school administrators and individual teachers 
we have grown significantly in recent years through acquisitions and internal growth 
for information on our recent acquisitions see the business combinations note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
our revenues for fiscal were billion and our operating income was million  which represented compound annual revenue growth  including acquisitions  of and compound annual operating income growth of  compared to our fiscal results 
our gross margin has improved from in fiscal to in fiscal this improvement was due to an increase in our offering of proprietary products and increased buying power 
we have acquired many specialty businesses  which tend to have more proprietary products in their offerings and consequently higher gross margins than our traditional businesses 
the specialty businesses have also experienced higher revenue growth than the traditional businesses  resulting in a product mix with higher gross margins 
in addition  our acquisitions of both specialty and traditional businesses have increased our purchasing power  resulting in reduced costs of the products we purchase 
further  with the recent acquisitions of school specialty publishing and califone  we have acquired suppliers through vertical acquisitions and have therefore captured the suppliers margins 
another factor contributing to the increase in gross margin is the direct sourcing of product through overseas channels 
our operating profit and margins have also improved significantly since fiscal  from million or of revenues in fiscal to million or of revenues in fiscal this improvement reflects our acquisitions of specialty businesses  which typically have higher operating margins than our traditional businesses 
in addition  through the integration of acquired businesses  we have been able to further improve our operating profit and margins by eliminating redundant expenses  leveraging overhead costs and improving purchasing power 
operating margins showed a modest decline from in fiscal to in fiscal  related to certain price concessions offered to customers in conjunction with the tight school funding environment over this period  as well as integration and facility closure costs incurred in fiscal related to the closure of our agawam  massachusetts and tempe  arizona facilities and the opening of our new distribution center in mt

our business and working capital needs are highly seasonal with peak sales levels occurring from june through october 
during this period  we receive  ship and bill the majority of our business so that schools and teachers receive their merchandise by the start of each school year 
our inventory levels increase in april through june in anticipation of the peak shipping season 
the majority of shipments are made between june and october and the majority of cash receipts are collected from september through december 
as a result  we usually earn more than of our annual net income in the first two quarters of our fiscal year and operate at a net loss in our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
our business is highly seasonal  and the acquisitions of seasonal businesses during the off season has depressed operating margins and income in the year of acquisition  the most dramatic of which were the jl hammett acquisition in fiscal and premier agendas acquisition in fiscal recent development on may   the company announced that it had entered into an agreement and plan of merger  dated as of may   with lbw holdings  inc and lbw acquisition  inc lbw holdings was formed for purposes of this transaction and is wholly owned by bain capital fund viii  lp  an affiliate of bain capital partners  llc  a boston based global private investment firm

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we currently have a million accounts receivable securitization facility which expires in november  and may be extended further with the financial institution s consent 
we entered into the facility for the purpose of reducing our variable rate interest expense 
at april   million was advanced under the accounts receivable securitization and accordingly  that amount of accounts receivable has been removed from our consolidated balance sheet 
costs associated with the sale of receivables  primarily related to the discount and loss on sale  for fiscal were million and are included in other expenses in our consolidated statement of operations

as of april   we did not have any material long term purchase obligations 
the short term purchase obligation relates to contractually obligated product development costs 
any other short term purchase obligations the company had as of april  were primarily for the purchase of inventory in the normal course 
fluctuations in quarterly results of operations our business is subject to seasonal influences 
our historical revenues and profitability have been dramatically higher in the first two quarters of our fiscal year  primarily due to increased shipments to customers coinciding with the start of each school year 
quarterly results also may be materially affected by the timing of acquisitions  the timing and magnitude of costs related to such acquisitions  variations in our costs for the products sold  the mix of products sold and general economic conditions 
moreover  the operating margins of companies we acquire may differ substantially from our own  which could contribute to further fluctuation in quarterly operating results 
therefore  results for any quarter are not indicative of the results that we may achieve for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year 

table of contents the following table sets forth certain unaudited consolidated quarterly financial data for fiscal years and in thousands  except per share data 
we derived this quarterly data from our unaudited consolidated financial statements 
fiscal first second third fourth total weeks weeks weeks weeks weeks revenues gross profit operating income loss net income loss per share amounts basic diluted fiscal first second third fourth total weeks weeks weeks weeks weeks revenues gross profit operating income loss net income loss per share amounts basic diluted inflation inflation has had and is expected to have only a minor effect on our results of operations and our internal and external sources of liquidity 
critical accounting policies we believe the policies identified below are critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business are discussed throughout md a where applicable 
refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item for detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and base them on a combination of historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies that require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are as follows revenue recognition revenue  net of estimated returns and allowances  is recognized upon the shipment of products or upon the completion of services provided to customers  which corresponds to the time when risk of ownership transfers  the selling price is fixed  the customer is obligated to pay and we have no significant remaining obligations 
cash received in advance from customers is deferred on our balance sheet as a current liability and recognized upon the shipment of products or upon the completion of services provided to the customers 

table of contents catalog costs and related amortization we spend over million annually to produce and distribute catalogs 
we accumulate all direct costs incurred  net of vendor cooperative advertising payments  in the development  production and circulation of our catalogs on our balance sheet until such time as the related catalog is mailed 
they are subsequently amortized into sg a over the expected sales realization cycle  which is one year or less 
consequently  any difference between our estimated and actual revenue stream for a particular catalog and the related impact on amortization expense is neutralized within a period of one year or less 
our estimate of the expected sales realization cycle for a particular catalog is based on  among other possible considerations  our historical sales experience with identical or similar catalogs and our assessment of prevailing economic conditions and various competitive factors 
we track our subsequent sales realization  reassess the marketplace  and compare our findings to our previous estimate and adjust the amortization of our future catalogs  if necessary 
development costs we accumulate external and certain internal costs incurred in the development of a master copy of a book  video or other media on our balance sheet 
as of april   we had million in net development costs on our balance sheet 
a majority of these costs are associated with our school specialty publishing and teacher s media company businesses 
the capitalized development costs are subsequently amortized into cost of revenues over the expected sales realization cycle of the products  which is typically five years 
during fiscal  we amortized to expense million related to development costs 
we continue to monitor the expected sales realization cycle for each product  and will adjust the remaining expected life of the development costs or recognize an impairment  if warranted 
goodwill and intangible assets at april   goodwill and intangible assets represented approximately of our total assets 
determining the recoverability of these assets requires considerable judgment and is evaluated on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
as it relates to goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  we apply the impairment rules in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as required by sfas no 
 the recoverability of these assets is subject to a fair value assessment which includes judgments regarding financial projections  including forecasted cash flows and discount rates  and comparable market values 
as it relates to finite life intangible assets  we apply the impairment rules as required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets which also requires significant judgments related to the expected future cash flows attributable to the intangible asset 
the impact of modifying any of these assumptions can have a significant impact on the estimate of fair value and  thus  the estimated recoverability  or impairment  if any  of the asset 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued liabilities and debt 
market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
our borrowings under our credit facility and our discount expense related to our accounts receivable securitization are primarily dependent upon libor rates 
assuming no change in our financial structure  if variable interest rates were to average basis points higher during fiscal  pre tax earnings would decrease by approximately million 
this amount was determined by considering a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates on average variable rate debt outstanding and the average advanced under the accounts receivable securitization facility during fiscal the estimated fair value of long term debt approximated its carrying value at april   with the exception of our convertible debt which at april  had a carrying value of million and a fair market value of million
