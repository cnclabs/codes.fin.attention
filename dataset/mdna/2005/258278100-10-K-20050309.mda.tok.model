the company s products are marketed under more than seventy proprietary brand names  through its motormite  dorman  allparts  scan tech  mpi and pik a nut businesses 
for the year ended december   net sales increased to million from million in the same period last year 
the sales growth was driven primarily by new product development  which is a key to the company s growth strategy 
gross margin remained essentially unchanged at in from in operating expenses increased at a slower rate than sales growth and therefore declined as a percentage of net sales to 
many of the company s operating expenses are fixed in nature and therefore did not increase in proportion to net sales growth 
as a result  net income increased to million in new product development is a critical success factor for the company 
the company has invested heavily in resources necessary for it to increase its new product development efforts and to strengthen its relationships with its customers 
these investments are primarily in the form of increased product development and awareness programs  customer service improvements and increased customer credits and allowances 
this has enabled the company to provide an expanding array of new product offerings and grow its revenues 
the automotive aftermarket has been consolidating over the past several years 
as a result  many of the company s customers have grown larger and therefore have more leverage in negotiations with the company 
recently  customers have pressed for extended payment terms and returns of slow moving product when negotiating with the company 
while the company does its best to avoid such concessions  in some cases payment terms to customers have been extended and returns of product have exceeded historical levels 
the product returns primarily affect the company s profit levels while terms extensions generally reduce operating cash flow and require additional capital to finance the business 
management expects both of these trends to continue for the foreseeable future 
page of the company may experience significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter in its results of operations due to the timing of orders placed by the company s customers 
generally  the second and third quarters have the highest level of customer orders  but the introduction of new products and product lines to customers may cause significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter 
the company operates on a fifty two  fifty three week period ending on the last saturday of the calendar year 
the fiscal years ended december   december  and december  were each fifty two week periods 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
the company regularly evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  customer credits  inventories  goodwill and income taxes 
estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be accurate and reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of the company s financial statements requires management to make estimates of the collectability of its accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
a significant percentage of the company s accounts receivable have been  and will continue to be  concentrated among a relatively small number of automotive retailers and warehouse distributors in the united states 
the company s five largest customers accounted for and of net accounts receivable as of december  and december   respectively 
a bankruptcy or financial loss associated with a major customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s sales and operating results 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts amounted to million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
revenue recognition and allowance for customer credits 
revenue is recognized from product sales when goods are shipped  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection is reasonably assured 
net sales are calculated by subtracting allowances for customer credits from gross revenues 
allowances for customer credits include costs for product returns  discounts and promotional rebates given to customers who purchase new products for inclusion in their stores  and the cost of competitors products that are purchased from the customer in order to induce a customer to purchase new product lines from the company 
the company provides for customer credits and potential returns at the time of sale 
management must make estimates of the ultimate value of customer credits that will be issued for future product returns and sales allowances granted to induce customers to purchase products from the company 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic conditions and changes in demand and acceptance of the company s products when evaluating the adequacy of its reserves for customer credits 
management judgements and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing reserves for customer credits in any accounting period 
material differences in the amount and timing of customer credits for any period may result if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for the reserves 
reserves for customer credits were million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
excess and obsolete inventory reserves 
management must make estimates of potential future excess and obsolete inventory costs 
the company provides reserves for discontinued and excess inventory based upon historical demand  forecasted usage  estimated customer requirements and product line updates 
the company page of maintains contact with its customer base in order to understand buying patterns  customer preferences and the life cycle of its products 
changes in customer requirements are factored into the reserve needs as needed 
reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
goodwill 
the company has adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
specifies that goodwill is no longer amortized but instead is subject to periodic impairment testing 
as a result  the company no longer amortizes goodwill 
the company has completed the impairment tests required by sfas no 
 which did not result in an impairment charge 
goodwill was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
income taxes 
the company follows the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
the company must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine its current provision for income taxes and also its deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
management s judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  its interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by tax authorities 
changes in tax laws or management s interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in the company s consolidated financial statements 
management s assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render management s current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause the company s actual income tax obligations to differ from its estimates

the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange resulted in a year over year increase in sales 
cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net sales  remained essentially flat at in compared to in the favorable effect of a change in sales mix was offset by approximately million in incremental expediting costs incurred to maintain satisfactory customer fill rates in the second half of as a result of material shortages for certain items and higher than planned demand 
overall material costs were down slightly in  although the company experienced price increases in several product lines in the second half of the year as a result of raw materials price increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses in increased to million from million 
the expense increase was at a slower rate than sales as many of the company s operating expenses are fixed in nature and therefore did not increase in proportion to sales growth 
the increase in expenses was the result of inflationary cost increases  an increase in variable operating expenses due to the sales volume growth and further investments by the company in its new product development capabilities 
interest expense  net decreased to million in from million in due to lower borrowing levels in the primary reason for the lower borrowing levels in was a reduction in the outstanding principal of the company s senior notes

cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net sales  declined to in from in the overall decline in cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales was the net result of three primary factors 
first  production and materials cost reduction initiatives resulted in cost savings that lowered cost of sales 
this benefit was offset by provisions for customer credits that increased as a percentage of sales in as a result of higher customer return levels in and a sales mix shift towards more lower gross margin product sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses in were held to million  which is the same level of spending as in despite additional investments in product development resources  inflationary cost increases and sales volume growth in this was achieved through the implementation of a number of cost saving measures which reduced overhead spending 
costs in also included million in non recurring net costs associated with the closure of one of the company s smaller distribution facilities 
page of interest expense  net decreased to million in from million in due to lower borrowing levels in the primary reason for the lower borrowing levels in was a reduction in the outstanding principal of the company s senior notes

cash and short term investments as of december  totaled million 
over the past three years the company has extended payment terms to certain customers as a result of customer requests and market demands 
these extended terms have resulted in increased accounts receivable levels and significant uses of cash flow 
the company participates in accounts receivable factoring programs with several customers which allow it to sell its accounts receivable on a non recourse basis to financial institutions to offset the negative cash flow impact of these payment terms extensions 
as of december  the company had sold million in accounts receivable under these programs and had removed them from its balance sheet 
the company expects continued pressure to extend its payment terms for the foreseeable future 
further extensions of customer payment terms will result in additional uses of cash flow or increased costs associated with the sale of accounts receivable

most of this spending was incurred in this initiative is expected to be completed in the second quarter of once completed  this project is expected to generate significant efficiency improvements and improved customer service capabilities for the company s dorman business 
total capital spending in was million as a result of the automation of the warsaw facility  a  square foot expansion of the warsaw facility early in the year  increased tooling costs for new products and other capital projects 
capital spending in is expected to be between and million  which is down from s level  but up over historic levels due primarily to increased spending on tooling for new products  which have become more complex over the past few years

these obligations as of december  are summarized in the tables below payments due by period less than contractual obligations total year years years after years long term borrowings    operating leases    amount of commitment expiration per period total amount amounts less than other commercial commitments committed year years years over years letters of credit   the company reported a net source of cash flow from its operating activities of million in fiscal the primary uses of cash flow were accounts receivable and inventory  which increased million and million  respectively 
accounts receivable grew as a result of higher sales and the impact of the continuing trend towards longer payment terms to certain customers 
inventory increased as a result of the sales increase in  and as a result of management s decision to increase levels of inventory safety stock in the third quarter of net income  depreciation and a million increase in accounts payable were the primary sources of operating cash flow in fiscal the payables increase was primarily the result of higher levels of inventory purchases and capital spending 
investing activities used million of cash in fiscal additions to property  plant and equipment required million of cash as a result of the company s automation and expansion of its central distribution center in warsaw  kentucky  tooling costs associated with new products  upgrades to information systems  purchases of equipment designed to improve operational efficiencies and scheduled equipment replacements 
the company previously purchased highly liquid corporate and government bonds with maturities from nine months to one year to take advantage of higher earnings rates on these investments 
these investments had been classified as short term investments as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
the company reported a net source of cash of million during the year related to the net proceeds from investments 
financing activities required million in cash in fiscal these uses were primarily the result of the scheduled repayment of million on the company s senior notes in august the company believes that cash and short term investments on hand and cash generated from operations together with its available sources of capital are sufficient to meet its ongoing cash needs for the foreseeable future 
page of foreign currency fluctuations in  approximately of the company s products were purchased from a variety of foreign countries 
the products generally are purchased through purchase orders with the purchase price specified in us dollars 
accordingly  the company does not have exposure to fluctuations in the relationship between the dollar and various foreign currencies between the time of execution of the purchase order and payment for the product 
however  recent weakness in the dollar has resulted in some materials price increase and pressure from several foreign suppliers to increase prices further 
to the extent that the dollar decreases in value to foreign currencies in the future or the present weakness in the dollar continues for a sustained period of time  the price of the product in dollars for new purchase orders may increase further 
the company makes significant purchases of product from chinese vendors 
the chinese yuan exchange rate has been fixed against the us dollar since recently  the chinese government has been under increasing pressure to revalue its currency  or to make its exchange rate more flexible 
most experts believe that the value of the yuan would increase relative to the us dollar if it was revalued or allowed to float 
such a move would most likely result in an increase in the cost of products that are purchased from china 
impact of inflation the company has not generally been adversely affected by inflation  although the company did experience some material cost increases as a result of raw materials shortages 
these increases did not have a material impact on the company 
the company believes that further cost increases could potentially be mitigated by passing along price increases to customers or through the use of alternative suppliers or resourcing purchases to other countries  however there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in such efforts
