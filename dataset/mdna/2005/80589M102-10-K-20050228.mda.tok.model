electric operations nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the electric operations segment is comprised of the electric operations of sce amp  g  genco and fuel company  and is primarily engaged in the generation  transmission and distribution of electricity in south carolina 
at december nbsp  sce amp  g provided electricity to over  customers in an area of approximately  square miles 
genco owns and operates a coal fired generation station and sells electricity solely to sce amp  g 
fuel company acquires  owns and provides financing for sce amp  g s nuclear fuel  fossil fuel and sulfur dioxide emission allowance requirements 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  operating results for electric operations are primarily driven by customer demand for electricity  the ability to control costs and rates allowed to be charged to customers 
embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity 
the allowed return on equity for sce amp  g was in in january nbsp  as a result of an electric rate case  the allowed return on equity was lowered to a range of to  with rates to be set at 
see further discussion at liquidity and capital resources 
demand for electricity is primarily affected by weather  customer growth and the economy 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  legislative and regulatory initiatives also could significantly impact the results of operations and cash flows for the electric operations segment 
in south carolina the state legislature is not actively pursuing electric restructuring 
however  both houses of the us congress introduced energy legislation in the legislative sessions  but failed to reach a compromise on certain key issues unrelated to utilities 
energy legislation is expected to be reintroduced in it is anticipated that such legislation would include provisions that would repeal puhca and transfer additional regulatory authority to ferc 
provisions in the legislation would likely impose reliability standards for high voltage transmission systems 
new legislation may also impose stringent requirements on power plants to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide  nitrogen oxides nox and mercury 
it is also possible that new initiatives will be introduced to reduce carbon dioxide emissions 
the company cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted  and if it is  the conditions it would impose on utilities 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in april nbsp  the joint us canada power system outage task force issued its final report on the august nbsp  blackout in the united states and canada causes and recommendations blackout report 
the blackout report contains recommendations that  if implemented  the task force believes would improve reliability of north america s interconnected bulk power system the grid 
full implementation of the blackout report s recommendations would require a number of actions by legislative  regulatory and industry participants 
however  the blackout report asserts as its single most important recommendation that the us congress should enact tougher reliability standards 
it is anticipated that any reliability legislation  if passed  would make reliability standards mandatory and enforceable with penalties for non compliance and would strengthen the role of ferc 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  regardless of the outcome of any legislative activity  ferc is expected to proceed with regulatory initiatives that  if enacted  could significantly change the country s existing regulatory framework governing transmission  open access and energy markets and would attempt  in large measure  to standardize the national energy market and attempt to disaggregate the remaining vertically integrated utilities 
in july nbsp  ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on standard market design smd which ferc supplemented with the issuance of a white paper in april nbsp  if implemented  the proposed rule could have a significant impact on sce amp  g s access to or cost of power for its native load customers and on sce amp  g s marketing of power outside its service territory 
the company is currently evaluating ferc s action to determine potential effects on sce amp  g s operations 
additional directives from ferc are expected 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the north american electric reliability council nerc also is expected to continue its initiatives to develop  establish and enforce additional standards for the grid 
to that end  nerc is working closely with ferc to implement stronger reliability standards among nerc s voluntary membership 
sce amp  g  along with other nerc members  is also working closely with nerc in these efforts 
such initiatives could be significantly influenced by any reliability legislation enacted by congress 
the company cannot predict whether congress will enact reliability legislation or the extent to which the other recommendations contained in the blackout report will be implemented 
any action by congress or initiatives by ferc or nerc could significantly impact sce amp  g s access to or cost of power for its native load customers and sce amp  g s marketing of power outside its service territory 
gas distribution nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the gas distribution segment is comprised of the distribution operations of sce amp  g and psnc energy  and is primarily engaged in the purchase  transmission and sale of natural gas in portions of north carolina and south carolina 
at december nbsp  this segment provided natural gas to more than  customers in an area of approximately  square miles 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  operating results for gas distribution are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas  the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers 
embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity  which in was for sce amp  g and for psnc energy 
demand for natural gas is primarily affected by weather  customer growth  the economy and  for commercial and industrial customers  the availability and price of alternate fuels 
natural gas competes with electricity  propane and heating oil to serve the heating and  to a lesser extent  other household energy needs of residential and small commercial customers 
this competition is generally based on price and convenience 
large commercial and industrial customers often have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel  such as propane or fuel oil 
natural gas competes with these alternate fuels based on price 
as a result  any significant disparity between supply and demand  either of natural gas or of alternate fuels  and due either to production or delivery disruptions or other factors  will affect price and impact the company s ability to retain large commercial and industrial customers 
gas transmission nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  for the gas transmission segment was comprised of scpc  which owns and operates an intrastate pipeline engaged in the purchase  transmission and sale of natural gas on a wholesale basis to distribution companies including sce amp  g and industrial customers throughout most of south carolina 
operating results for were primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas  the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers 
embedded in these rates is an allowed regulatory return on equity  which in was to 
demand for natural gas is primarily affected by the price of alternate fuels and customer growth 
scpc supplies natural gas to sce amp  g for its resale to gas distribution customers and for certain electric generation needs 
scpc also sells natural gas to large commercial and industrial customers in south carolina and faces the same competitive pressures as the gas distribution segment for these classes of customers 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in  scana expects to merge scpc with another subsidiary  scg pipeline  which owns and operates an interstate pipeline that transports natural gas from southeast georgia to south carolina and delivers natural gas to sce amp  g s jasper county electric generating station 
the merger is subject to customary closing conditions and ferc approval 
assuming the merger is completed  the new company will operate as an interstate pipeline engaged in the transmission of natural gas in southeast georgia and south carolina 
the new company s rates for transmission services  including an allowed return on equity  would be set and regulated by ferc 
retail gas marketing nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  scana energy  a division of semi  comprises the retail gas marketing segment 
this segment markets natural gas to over  customers as of december nbsp  throughout georgia 
scana energy s total customer base represents about a nbsp  percent share of the approximately nbsp  million customers in georgia s deregulated natural gas market 
scana energy remains the second largest natural gas marketer in the state 
scana energy s competitors include affiliates of other large energy companies with experience in georgia s energy market as well as several electric membership cooperatives 
scana energy s ability to maintain its market share depends on the prices it charges customers relative to the prices charged by its competitors  its ability to continue to provide high levels of customer service and other factors 
in addition  the pipeline capacity available for scana energy to serve industrial and other customers is tied to the market share held by scana energy in the retail market 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as georgia s regulated provider  scana energy serves low income customers at rates approved by the gpsc and receives funding from the universal service fund for bad debts 
at december nbsp  scana energy s regulated division served approximately  customers 
in the gpsc extended scana energy s term as the regulated provider through august nbsp  in  using a request for proposal process  the gpsc will select a regulated provider for the two year period beginning september nbsp  scana energy intends to submit a bid during this process 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  scana energy and scana s other natural gas distribution  transmission and marketing segments maintain gas inventory and also utilize forward contracts and financial instruments  including futures contracts and options  to manage their exposure to fluctuating commodity natural gas prices 
see note nbsp  to the consolidated financial statements 
as a part of this risk management process  at any given time  a portion of scana s projected natural gas needs has been purchased or otherwise placed under contract 
since scana energy operates in a competitive market  it may be unable to sustain its current levels of customers and or pricing  thereby reducing expected margins and profitability 
energy marketing nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the divisions of semi  excluding scana energy  comprise the energy marketing segment 
this segment markets natural gas primarily in the southeast and provides energy related risk management services to producers and customers 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the operating results for energy marketing are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas and the ability to control costs 
demand for natural gas is primarily affected by the price of alternate fuels and customer growth 
results of operations nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the company s reported earnings loss are prepared in accordance with gaap 
management believes that  in addition to reported earnings loss under gaap  the company s gaap adjusted net earnings from operations provides a meaningful representation of its fundamental earnings power and can aid in performing period over period financial analysis and comparison with peer group data 
in management s opinion  gaap adjusted net earnings from operations is a useful indicator of the financial results of the company s primary businesses 
this measure is also a basis for management s provision of earnings guidance and growth projections  and it is used by management in making resource allocation and other budgetary and operational decisions 
this non gaap performance measure is not intended to replace the gaap measure of net earnings  but is offered as a supplement to it 
a reconciliation of reported gaap earnings loss per share to gaap adjusted net earnings from operations per share  as well as cash dividend information  is provided in the table below nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  reported gaap earnings loss per share nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  less realized gains from sales of telecommunications investments and assets nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  plus realized losses from sales of telecommunications investments and assets nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  plus telecommunications investment impairments nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  plus charge related to pending litigation nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  plus cumulative effect of accounting change nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  gaap adjusted net earnings from operations per share nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  cash dividends declared per share nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  discussion of above adjustments nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  realized gains losses on telecommunications investments of

nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  management believes that all of the above adjustments are appropriate in determining the non gaap financial performance measure 
management utilizes such measure itself in exerting budgetary control  managing business operations and determining eligibility for incentive compensation payments 
such non gaap measure is based on management s decision that the telecommunications assets are not a part of the company s core businesses and will not be available to provide earnings on a long term basis 
the non gaap measure also provides a consistent basis upon which to measure performance by properly excluding the effects on per share earnings of transactions involving the company s telecommunications investments  the cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting standard and a litigation charge related to the sale of a prior business

allowance for funds used during construction afc nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  afc is a utility accounting practice whereby a portion of the cost of both equity and borrowed funds used to finance construction which is shown on the balance sheet as construction work in progress is capitalized 
the company includes an equity portion of afc in nonoperating income and a debt portion of afc in interest charges credits as noncash items  both of which have the effect of increasing reported net income 
afc represented approximately of income before income taxes in  in and in the ratio in was significantly higher than historical norms due to the inclusion in income before income taxes of nbsp  million of impairments related to the other than temporary decline in market value of the company s investment in dtag and itc deltacom 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in addition to the effect of impairments  the decrease in afc for vs is partially due to completion of the jasper county electric generating station in may nbsp  the decrease in afc for vs is partially due to the completion of the urquhart station repowering project in june nbsp  also  in january nbsp  the scpsc issued an order allowing sce amp  g to include all jasper county generating project expenditures as of december nbsp  and other construction work in progress expenditures as of june nbsp  in its electric rate base 
at the time the expenditures were included in the rate base  afc was no longer calculated on those amounts

the ability of the regulated subsidiaries to replace existing plant investment  as well as to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas  will depend on their ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms 
regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services through rates charged to customers 
rates for regulated services are generally based on historical costs 
as customer growth and inflation occur and these subsidiaries continue their ongoing construction programs  rate increases will be sought

electric operations nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the caa required electric utilities to substantially reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nox by the year the company remains in compliance with these requirements 
in the epa required the state of south carolina  among other states  to modify its state implementation plan sip to address the issue of nox pollution 
south carolina s sip requires additional emissions reductions in and beyond 
further  the epa had indicated that it would finalize regulations by march nbsp  for stricter limits on mercury generated by coal fired plants 
further reductions in sulfur dioxide and nox are expected to be proposed in new legislation may also impose stringent requirements on power plants to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide  nox and mercury 
it is also possible that new initiatives will be introduced to reduce carbon dioxide emissions 
the company cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted  and if it is  the conditions the legislation would impose on utilities 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the epa has undertaken an aggressive enforcement initiative against the utilities industry  and the doj has brought suit against a number of utilities in federal court alleging violations of the caa 
at least two of these suits have either been tried or have had substantive motions decided  one favorable to the industry and one not 
neither is binding as precedent on the company 
prior to the suits  those utilities had received requests for information under section nbsp  of the caa and were issued notices of violation 
the basis for these suits is the assertion by the epa  under a stringent rule known as new source review nsr  that maintenance activities undertaken by the utilities over the past or more years constitute major modifications which would have required the installation of costly best available control technology bact 
sce amp  g and genco have received and responded to section nbsp  requests for information related to canadys  wateree and williams stations 
the regulations under the caa provide certain exemptions to the definition of major modifications  including an exemption for routine repair  replacement or maintenance 
on october nbsp  epa published a final revised nsr rule in the federal register with an effective date of december nbsp  the new rule represents an industry favorable departure from certain positions advanced by the federal government in the nsr enforcement initiative 
however  on motion of several northeastern states  the united states circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia stayed the effect of the final rule 
the ultimate application of the final rule to the company is uncertain 
the company has analyzed each of the activities covered by the epa s requests and believes each of these activities is covered by the exemption for routine repair  replacement and maintenance under what it believes is a fair reading of both the prior regulation and the contested revised regulation 
the regulations also provide an exemption for an increase in emissions resulting from increased hours of operation or production rate and from demand growth 
the current state of continued doj enforcement actions is the subject of industry wide speculation  but it is possible that the epa will commence enforcement actions against sce amp  g and genco  and the epa has the authority to seek penalties at the rate of up to  per day for each violation 
the epa also could seek installation of bact or equivalent at the three plants 
the company believes that any enforcement actions relative to the company s  sce amp  g s or genco s compliance with the caa would be without merit 
however  if successful  such actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
to comply with current and anticipated state and federal regulations  sce amp  g and genco expect to incur capital expenditures totaling approximately nbsp  million over the period to retrofit existing facilities  with increased operation and maintenance costs of approximately nbsp  million per year 
sce amp  g and genco expect to have increased operation and maintenance costs of approximately nbsp  million in to meet compliance requirements for the years through  the company anticipates additional capital expenditures totaling approximately nbsp  million 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the clean water act  as amended  provides for the imposition of effluent limitations that require treatment for wastewater discharges 
under this act  compliance with applicable limitations is achieved under a national permit program 
discharge permits have been issued for all  and renewed for nearly all  of sce amp  g s and genco s generating units 
concurrent with renewal of these permits  the permitting agency has implemented a more rigorous program of monitoring and controlling thermal discharges  has modified the requirements for cooling water intake structures  and has required strategies for toxicity reduction in wastewater streams 
the company is developing compliance plans for these initiatives 
congress is expected to consider further amendments to the clean water act 
such legislation may include limitations to mixing zones and toxicity based standards

sce amp  g entered into a standard contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel and or high level radioactive waste standard contract with the doe in providing for permanent disposal of its spent nuclear fuel in exchange for agreed payments at particular amounts 
on january nbsp  sce amp  g and santee cooper one third owner of summer station filed suit in the court of federal claims against the doe for breach of the standard contract  because as of the date of filing  the federal government has accepted no spent fuel from summer station or any other utility for transport and disposal  and has indicated that it does not anticipate doing so until  at the earliest 
as a consequence of the federal government s breach of contract  the plaintiffs have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs 
there are two additional causes of action alleged as well  damages for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and a takings claim demanding just compensation for the taking of the plaintiffs real property through the cost of storage

south carolina electric nbsp  amp  gas company nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  sce amp  g is subject to the jurisdiction of the scpsc as to retail electric and gas rates  service  accounting  issuance of securities other than short term borrowings and other matters 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in a january nbsp  order the scpsc granted sce amp  g a composite increase in retail electric rates of approximately  designed to produce additional annual revenues of approximately nbsp  million based on a test year calculation 
the scpsc lowered sce amp  g s return on common equity from to a range of between and  with rates to be set at 
the new rates became effective in january nbsp  as part of its order  the scpsc approved sce amp  g s recovery of construction and operating costs for sce amp  g s new jasper county electric generating station  recovery of costs of mandatory environmental upgrades primarily related to federal clean air act regulations and the application of current and anticipated net synthetic fuel tax credits to offset the cost of constructing the back up dam at lake murray 
the scpsc also approved recovery over a five year period of sce amp  g s approximately nbsp  million of costs incurred in the formation of the gridsouth regional transmission organization and recovery through base rates over three years of approximately nbsp  million of purchased power costs that were previously deferred 
as a part of its order  the scpsc extended through its approval of the accelerated capital recovery plan for sce amp  g s cope generating station 
under the plan  based on the level of revenues and operating expenses  sce amp  g may increase depreciation of its cope generating station in excess of amounts that would be recorded based upon currently approved depreciation rates  not to exceed nbsp  million annually  without additional approval of the scpsc 
any unused portion of the nbsp  million in any given year may be carried forward for possible use in the following year 
synthetic fuel investments nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  sce amp  g holds two equity method investments in partnerships involved in converting coal to non conventional fuel  the use of which fuel qualifies for federal income tax credits 
the aggregate investment in these partnerships as of december nbsp  is approximately nbsp  million  and through december nbsp   they have generated and passed through to sce amp  g approximately nbsp  million in such tax credits 
at december nbsp  sce amp  g has recorded on its balance sheet nbsp  million net deferred synthetic fuel tax benefits  which includes the effects of partnership losses 
in addition  primesouth  nbsp  inc  a non regulated subsidiary of scana  operates a synthetic fuel facility for a third party and receives management fees  royalties and expense reimbursements related to these services 
primesouth does not benefit from any synfuel tax credits 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  under a plan approved by the scpsc  any tax credits generated by the partnerships and ultimately passed through to sce amp  g from synfuel produced for and consumed by sce amp  g  net of partnership losses and other expenses  have been and will be deferred and will be applied to offset the capital costs of constructing the back up dam at lake murray 
see note nbsp  to the consolidated financial statements 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in march nbsp  one of the partnerships  sc coaltech no 
nbsp  l sc  received a no change letter from the internal revenue service irs related to its synthetic fuel operations for the tax year after review of testing procedures and supporting documentation and conducting an independent investigation  the irs found that the partnership produces a qualifying fuel under section nbsp  of the internal revenue code irc and found no reason to challenge the first placed in service status of the facility 
this letter supports scana s position that the synthetic fuel tax credits have been properly claimed 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in order to earn these tax credits  scana must be subject to a regular federal income tax liability in an amount at least equal to the credits generated in any taxable year 
this tax liability could be insufficient if the company s consolidated taxable income were to be significantly reduced as the result of realizing lower income or large deductions in any taxable year 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  section nbsp  of the irc provides for the reduction of synthetic fuel tax credits for any calendar year in which the average annual wellhead price of oil exceeds an inflation adjusted base price per barrel as defined in the irc  and currently estimated to be approximately  up to a maximum price spread as defined in the irc  and currently estimated to be in the range of  at which point the credits would be completely phased out 
the company cannot predict what impact  if any  the price of oil may have on the company s ability to earn synthetic fuel tax credits in the future 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the availability of these synthetic fuel tax credits is also subject to coal availability and other operational risks related to the generating plants  including those described in the risk factors section within item nbsp  business 
nuclear license extension nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in april nbsp  the nrc approved sce amp  g s application for a year license extension for its summer station 
the extension allows the plant to operate through august nbsp  public service company of north carolina  incorporated nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  psnc energy is subject to the jurisdiction of the ncuc as to gas rates  issuance of securities other than notes with a maturity of two years or less or renewals of notes with a maturity of six years or less  accounting and other matters 
as a condition to obtaining the ncuc s approval of scana s acquisition of psnc energy  psnc energy agreed to a moratorium on general rate increases until after august nbsp  general rate relief can be obtained to recover costs associated with materially adverse governmental actions and force majeure events 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the u 
s 
congress passed the pipeline safety improvement act of the pipeline safety act  directing the u 
s 
department of transportation to establish a pipeline integrity management rule for operations of natural gas systems with transmission pipelines located near moderate to high density populations 
of psnc energy s approximately miles of transmission pipeline subject to the pipeline safety act  approximately miles are located within these areas 
fifty percent of these miles of pipeline must be assessed by december nbsp  and the remainder by december nbsp  depending on the assessment method used  psnc energy will be required to reinspect these same miles of pipeline every five to seven years 
though cost estimates for this project were developed using various assumptions  each of which are subject to imprecision  psnc energy currently estimates the total cost to be nbsp  million for the initial assessments and any subsequent remediation required through december nbsp  on january nbsp  the ncuc authorized the company to defer for subsequent rate consideration certain expenses incurred to comply with dot s pipeline integrity management requirements 
this accounting treatment was effective november nbsp  south carolina pipeline corporation nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  scpc has approximately miles of transmission line that are covered by the pipeline safety act 
total costs for compliance with the pipeline safety act have not been determined 
critical accounting policies and estimates nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  following are descriptions of the company s accounting policies which are most critical in terms of reporting financial condition or results of operations 
utility regulation nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  scana s regulated utilities are subject to the provisions of sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  which require them to record certain assets and liabilities that defer the recognition of expenses and revenues to future periods as a result of being rate regulated 
in the future  as a result of deregulation or other changes in the regulatory environment  the company may no longer meet the criteria for continued application of sfas nbsp  and could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the company s electric distribution and gas distribution segments in the period the write off would be recorded 
it is not expected that cash flows or financial position would be materially affected 
see note nbsp  to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s regulatory assets and liabilities  including those associated with the company s environmental assessment program 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the company s generation assets would be exposed to considerable financial risks in a deregulated electric market 
if market prices for electric generation do not produce adequate revenue streams and the enabling legislation or regulatory actions do not provide for recovery of the resulting stranded costs  the company could be required to write down its investment in those assets 
the company cannot predict whether any write downs will be necessary and  if they are  the extent to which they would adversely affect the company s results of operations in the period in which they would be recorded 
as of december nbsp  the company s net investments in fossil hydro and nuclear generation assets were approximately nbsp  billion and nbsp  million  respectively 
revenue recognition and unbilled revenues nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers 
because customers of the company s utilities and retail gas operations are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual reading of their electric and gas meters  the company records estimates for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period 
such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of the amount of energy delivered to each customer since the date of the last reading of their respective meters 
such unbilled revenues reflect consideration of estimated usage by customer class  the effects of different rate schedules  changes in weather and  where applicable  the impact of weather normalization provisions of rate structures 
the accrual of unbilled revenues in this manner properly matches revenues and related costs 
as of december nbsp  and  accounts receivable included unbilled revenues of nbsp  million and nbsp  million  respectively  compared to total revenues for and of nbsp  billion and nbsp  billion  respectively 
provisions for bad debts and allowances for doubtful accounts nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as of each balance sheet date  the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and records allowances for doubtful accounts based on estimates of the level of expected write offs 
these estimates are based on  among other things  comparisons of the relative age of accounts  assigned credit ratings for commercial and industrial accounts  and consideration of actual write off history 
the distribution segments of the company s regulated utilities have established write off histories and regulated service areas that enable the utilities to reliably estimate their respective provisions for bad debts 
the company s retail gas marketing segment operates in georgia s deregulated natural gas market 
as such  estimation of the provision for bad debts related to this segment is subject to greater imprecision 
nuclear decommissioning nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  accounting for decommissioning costs for nuclear power plants involves significant estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future 
among the factors that could change sce amp  g s accounting estimates related to decommissioning costs are changes in technology  changes in regulatory and environmental remediation requirements  and changes in financial assumptions such as discount rates and timing of cash flows 
changes in any of these estimates could significantly impact the company s financial position and cash flows although changes in such estimates should be earnings neutral  because these costs are expected to be collected from ratepayers 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  sce amp  g s share of estimated site specific nuclear decommissioning costs for summer station  including the cost of decommissioning plant components not subject to radioactive contamination  totals approximately nbsp  million  stated in dollars 
this estimate is based on a decommissioning study completed in and has not been updated to incorporate the year license extension for summer station received in santee cooper is responsible for decommissioning costs related to its one third ownership interest in the station 
the cost estimate is based on a decommissioning methodology acceptable to the nrc under which the site would be maintained over a period of approximately nbsp  years in such a manner as to allow for subsequent decontamination that permits release for unrestricted use 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  under sce amp  g s method of funding decommissioning costs  funds collected through rates are invested in insurance policies on the lives of certain company personnel 
sce amp  g is the beneficiary of these policies 
through these insurance contracts  sce amp  g is able to take advantage of income tax benefits and accrue earnings on a tax deferred basis 
amounts for decommissioning collected through electric rates  insurance proceeds  and interest on proceeds  less expenses  are transferred by sce amp  g to an external trust fund 
management intends for the fund  including earnings thereon  to provide for all eventual decommissioning expenditures on an after tax basis 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  scana follows sfas  employers accounting for pensions  in accounting for its defined benefit pension plan 
scana s plan is fully funded and as such  net pension income is reflected in the financial statements see results of operations 
sfas requires the use of several assumptions  the selection of which may have a large impact on the resulting benefit recorded 
among the more sensitive assumptions are those surrounding discount rates and returns on assets 
net pension income of nbsp  million recorded in reflects the use of a discount rate and an assumed long term rate of return on plan assets 
scana believes that these assumptions were  and that the resulting pension income amount was  reasonable 
for purposes of comparison  using a discount rate of in would have increased scana s pension income by approximately nbsp  million 
had the assumed long term rate of return on assets been reduced to in  scana s pension income would have been reduced by approximately nbsp  million 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in determining the appropriate discount rate  the company considers the market indices of high quality long term fixed income securities 
as such  the company selected the beginning of year discount rate of as being within a reasonable range of interest rates for obligations rated aa by moody s as of january nbsp  this same discount rate was also selected for determination of other postemployment benefits costs discussed below 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the following information with respect to pension assets and returns thereon should also be noted nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the company determines the fair value of substantially all of its pension assets utilizing market quotes rather than utilizing any calculated values  market related values or other modeling techniques 
in developing the expected long term rate of return assumptions  the company evaluated input from actuaries and from pension fund investment advisors  including such advisors review of the plan s historical   and nbsp  year cumulative actual returns of   and  respectively  all of which have been in excess of related broad indices 
the company anticipates that the investment managers will continue to generate long term returns of at least 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the expected long term rate of return of is based on a target asset allocation of with equity managers and with fixed income managers 
management regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the portfolio to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  while investment performance in and lower discount rates have significantly reduced pension income from previous or historical levels  the pension trust has been and remains adequately funded  and no contributions have been required since as such  these occurrences have had no impact on the company s cash flows 
based on stress testing performed by the company s actuaries  management does not anticipate the need to make pension contributions until after nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  similar to its pension accounting  scana follows sfas nbsp  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  in accounting for its postretirement medical and life insurance benefits 
this plan is unfunded  so no assumptions related to rate of return on assets impact the net expense recorded  however  the selection of discount rates can significantly impact the actuarial determination of net expense 
scana used a discount rate of and recorded a net sfas nbsp  cost of nbsp  million for had the selected discount rate been  the expense for would have been approximately nbsp  million higher 
asset retirement obligations nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  sfas nbsp  provides guidance for recording and disclosing liabilities related to future legally enforceable obligations to retire assets aro 
sfas nbsp  applies to the legal obligation associated with the retirement of long lived tangible assets that result from their acquisition  construction  development and normal operation 
because such obligation relates solely to the company s regulated electric utility  adoption of sfas nbsp  had no impact on results of operations 
as of january nbsp   the company had recorded an aro of approximately nbsp  million  which exceeded the previously recorded reserve for nuclear plant decommissioning of approximately nbsp  million 
at december nbsp  such aro totaled approximately nbsp  million 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the company believes that there is legal uncertainty as to the existence of environmental obligations associated with certain of its electric transmission and distribution properties 
the company believes that any aro related to this type of property would be insignificant and  due to the indeterminate life of the related assets  an aro could not be reasonably estimated 
other matters unconsolidated special purpose entities nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  although scana invests in securities and business ventures  it does not hold investments in unconsolidated special purpose entities such as those described in sfas nbsp  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  or as described in financial accounting standards board interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities
