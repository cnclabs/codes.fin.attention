item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis reflects fidelity bankshares  inc s consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the information in this section in conjunction with fidelity bankshares  inc s consolidated financial statements and their notes beginning on page f  and the other statistical data provided in this report 
this report contains certain forward looking statements which may be identified by the use of such words as believe  expect  intend  anticipate  should  planned  estimated and potential 
examples 
table of contents of forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  estimates with respect to our financial condition  results of operations and business that are subject to various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates and most other statements that are not historical in nature 
these factors include  but are not limited to  general and local economic conditions  changes in interest rates  deposit flows  demand for mortgage and other loans  real estate values  and competition  changes in accounting principles policies  or guidelines  changes in legislation or regulations  and other economic  competitive  governmental  regulatory  and technological factors affecting our operations  pricing  products and services 
we conduct no business other than holding the common stock of fidelity federal bank trust 
consequently  our net income depends on the net income of fidelity federal bank trust 
the net income of fidelity federal bank trust is derived primarily from its net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income we receive on loans  mortgage backed securities and investments and our cost of funds  consisting of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
fidelity federal bank trust s net income also is affected by its provision for loan losses  as well as by the amount of other income  including income from fees and service charges  net gains and losses on sales of investments  and operating expenses such as employee compensation and benefits  deposit insurance premiums  occupancy and equipment costs  and income taxes 
in addition  earnings are affected significantly by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities  which events are beyond our control 
in particular  the general level of market interest rates tends to be highly cyclical 
pending acquisition of first community bancorp  inc on september  we announced that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire first community bancorp  inc first community for approximately million in cash and approximately  shares of our common stock 
regulatory and stockholder approval for this acquisition is expected in march and the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of at december   first community had million in assets  million in deposits and million in stockholders equity 
approximately of first community bank s deposits consist of certificates of deposit  while are core deposits  consisting of checking  savings and money market accounts 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of fidelity bankshares  inc and its subsidiaries conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are shown below 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s best estimate of inherent losses in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the provision for loan losses is determined based on management s assessment of several factors reviews and evaluations of specific loans  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current and anticipated economic conditions and the related impact on specific borrowers and industry groups  historical loan loss experience  the level of classified and nonperforming loans and the results of regulatory examinations 
a periodic review of selected credits based on loan size and type is conducted to identify loans with heightened risk or inherent losses and to assign risk grades 
the primary responsibility for this review rests with the management personnel who are responsible for overseeing the credit relationship 
this review is supplemented with periodic reviews by our credit review function  as well as periodic examination of both selected credits and the credit review process by the applicable regulatory agencies 
the information from these 
table of contents reviews assists management in the timely identification of problems and potential problems  and provides a basis for deciding whether the credit represents a probable loss or risk that should be recognized 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  in economic conditions  in historical loss experience and in the conditions of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
long lived assets 
long lived assets  such as office  properties and equipment  to be held and used by the company are reviewed to determine whether any events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
for long lived assets to be held and used  we base our evaluation on impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets  any historical or future profitability measurements  as well as other external market conditions or factors that may be present 
if impairment indicators are present or other factors exist that indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  the fair value of the asset is measured using quoted market prices or  in the absence of quoted fair market prices  fair value is based on the estimate of discounted cash flow analysis or other available methods 
if an impairment has occurred  we recognize a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the asset 
servicing assets 
servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when rights are acquired through sale of financial assets 
for sales of mortgage loans  a portion of the cost of originating the loan is allocated to the servicing right based on relative fair value 
fair valued is based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts 
capitalized servicing rights are reported in other assets and are amortized into non interest income in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets 
servicing assets are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost 
impairment is determined by stratifying rights into tranches based on predominant risk characteristics  such as interest rate  loan type and investor type 
impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance  to the extent that fair value is less than the capitalized amount of servicing rights 
if we later determine that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists  a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as an increase to income 
servicing fee income is recorded for fees earned for servicing loans 
the fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal  or a fixed amount per loan and are recorded as income when earned 
the amortization of mortgage servicing rights is netted against loan servicing fee income 
determining fair value of financial instruments 
we require to disclose the fair value of certain of its financial instruments 
the following is a summary of how the fair value of these assets and liabilities is determined 
securities available for sale and held to maturity the fair value of these securities are based on quoted market prices 
loans receivable the fair value of fixed and variable rate loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows of the loans using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit rating for the same remaining maturities 
federal home loan bank stock the carrying value of federal home loan bank stock approximates fair value based on the redemption provisions of the federal home loan bank 
advances from the federal home loan bank the fair value of these advances is estimated by discounting the future cash flows of these advances using the current rates at which similar term advances could be obtained 

table of contents junior subordinated debentures the fair value of these debentures is estimated by discounting the future cash flows of the debentures using current rates at which similar debentures could be obtained 
although management uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of these financial instruments  there are inherent limitations in any estimation technique 
therefore  the fair value estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts which the bank could realize in a current transaction 
changes in financial position comparison of financial position at december  and december  our assets increased by million from billion at december  to billion at december  our net loans receivable increased by million 
we also securitized million of loans from our loan portfolio and now hold these mortgage backed securities as assets held to maturity 
this securitization was undertaken to improve our regulatory risk based capital levels 
our cash and cash equivalents increased by million 
another asset increase requiring funding included office properties and equipment  which increased by million 
our required investment in fhlb stock also increased by million  while all other assets increased by million 
additionally  a reduction in fhlb advances required million of funding 
funds were principally provided by cash received from the decrease in assets available for sale of million and an increase in deposits of million 
increases in borrowings provided million in funds  while increases in equity provided additional funding of million 
of the increases in stockholders equity  million was provided by a secondary issue of million shares of our common stock in december net income  net of dividends paid provided an additional million increase in equity 
stockholder s equity totaled million at december   compared to at december  results of operations results of operations for the years ended december  and general 
we split our common stock on a three for two share basis by distributing a stock dividend to our shareholders of record on december  all per share data retroactively reflects this stock split 
our net income for the year ended december  was million  or basic and diluted earnings per share  compared to net income for the year ended december  of million or 
basic and 
diluted earnings per share 
several factors contributed to this million  or  increase in net income 
interest income increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  interest expense  however  increased by only million from million for to million for the year ended december  as a result  net interest income increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million in our provision for loan losses was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  from year to year 
other income increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  operating expense increased by million  or  from million in to million for the year ended december  interest income 
our interest income increased by million  or  from million in to million for the year ended december  although the average yield on our interest earning assets declined from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   our average interest earning assets increased by million or  from billion to billion 
the decline in average yield resulted primarily from the repayment of assets acquired in a higher interest rate environment being replaced in a lower interest rate environment 

table of contents interest income on mortgage loans increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  while the average balance of these loans increased by million  or  the average yield on the loans declined from during to during interest income on consumer and commercial business loans increased by  or million  from million for the year ended december  to million during although the average balance of these loans increased by million  or  this was partially offset by a decrease in average yield on these loans from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the average balance of our mortgage backed securities increased by million  or 
together with an increase in yield from in to during  this resulted in an increase in interest income of million  or  from million in to million for the year ended december  interest income from investment securities increased by million  or  from million in to million in  as a result of a increase in the average balances of these assets 
the yield on investment securities for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
our interest income on other investments declined by  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  while the average yield on these investments increased from during to for the year ended december   the average balance of these investments declined by  offsetting the benefits from the increase in yield 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  interest expense on deposits increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  during  the average balance of our deposits increased by million  or 
the average cost of our deposits during was  compared to for the year ended december  the principal reason for the decrease in that the average cost of our deposits was the increase in our total core deposits  consisting of lower costing checking  savings and money market accounts 
at december   and our core deposits comprised  and  respectively  of our total deposits 
management believes that these core deposits will be less interest rate sensitive in a rising interest rate environment 
the average balance of our borrowings for the year ended december  increased by million  or 
the average cost of our borrowings during was and declined to for the year ended december  accordingly  interest expense on borrowings increased by only million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  net interest income 
our net interest income increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our net interest spread remained relatively constant at and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
however  our average balance of interest earning assets increased by million  or  resulting in the increase in net interest income 
provision for loan losses 
our provision for loan losses decreased by  from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
accordingly  allowances for loan losses are based on management s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
we provide both general valuation allowances for unspecified  probable losses and specific valuation allowances for known losses in our portfolio 
general valuation allowances are added to our capital for purposes of calculating our regulatory risk based capital 
we conduct a monthly review of our loan portfolio  including impaired loans  to determine whether any loans require classification or the establishment of appropriate valuation allowances 
as we continue to increase our originations of commercial business loans  consumer loans and commercial real estate loans  our provision for loan losses is likely to increase in future periods  since such loans traditionally have a higher risk of loss than residential mortgage loans 

table of contents other income 
other income increased by  or million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  income from service charges on deposit accounts increased by million  or  from million in to million for the year ended december  fees for other banking services  which includes premiums on insurance sales  trust fee income  annuity sales and appraisal service income increased by million  or  from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net gain on the sale of loans was million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decline of million  or 
the year ended december  included a one time gain of million on the sale of million of loans 
we have been selling substantially all of the year  fixed rate loans that we originate 
during  our customers have opted for a greater percentage of shorter duration loans and adjustable rate loans 
as a result  we have had fewer loans available for sale 
operating expense 
operating expense increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  employee compensation and benefits expense increased by million  or  from million during to million for the year ended december  direct compensation accounted for million of the million increase  while benefits cost increases were million 
the company s workforce grew by  to full time equivalent employees at december  from full time equivalent employees at december  increases in benefit costs include a  increase in medical care costs and a  increase in esop costs which reflects increases in the market value of our common stock 
occupancy and equipment costs increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  of this increase   is attributable to increased data processing costs  while the remainder is largely related to our continued growth 
marketing and federal deposit insurance costs increased by  and  respectively  from to miscellaneous expense increased by  or million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  of this increase  million resulted from the write off of deferred issuance costs on the redemption of trust preferred securities  million relates to the write off of fraudulent checks received   resulted from the write off of misapplied account balances in connection with our check imaging conversion  million reflected increased temporary help costs   was for consulting and accounting cost primarily related to sarbanes oxley compliance  and  was for the settlement of a lawsuit 
income taxes 
our provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this represents a increase in income taxes  which corresponds to the increase in our income before taxes 
our effective tax rate was in both and results of operations results of operations for the years ended december  and general 
our net income for the year ended december  was million 
or basic and diluted earnings per share 
by comparison  our net income for the year ended december  was million  or basic and diluted earnings per share 
a number of factors contributed to the million increase in net income for the year ended december  interest income increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  and was accompanied by a million decrease in interest expense from million in to million in this resulted in an increase of net interest income before loan losses of million  or  from million in to million in the provision for loan losses increased for the year ended december  by million from million in to million in our portfolio of commercial mortgage loans  consumer loans and commercial business loans increased as a percentage of our total loan portfolio 
other income increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our operating expenses for the year 
table of contents ended december  increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million 
interest income 
interest income increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  while average interest earning assets increased by million  or  the yield on our assets declined to during  compared to during the decline in yield resulted from originating loans during the year s low interest rate environment  borrower prepayment of higher interest bearing loans and our increased investment in mortgage backed securities bearing lower interest rates 
interest income from mortgage loans increased by  or million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  although the average balance of mortgage loans increased by million  or  it was accompanied by a decline in average yield on these assets from in to in the average balance of consumer and commercial business loans increased by million  or  but was offset by a decline in average yield from in to in as a result  interest income on consumer and commercial business loans declined by  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our average investment in mortgage backed securities increased by  as a result of funds provided by our strong deposit growth  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  because the average yield on these investments declined from during to during  income from mortgage backed securities increased by only million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the average balance of our investment securities declined by million  or  from million during to million during  and the average yield on these investments declined from during to during accordingly  our interest income from investment securities declined by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our average balance of other investments declined by million  or  from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december   and the average yield on these investments declined from during to during this resulted in a decrease in interest income from other investments of million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  interest expense on deposits decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  while average deposits increased by million  or  from billion to billion  the composition of our average deposit balances included a higher percentage of lower cost transaction and savings accounts  as well as a decrease of million in higher cost certificates of deposit 
consequently  the average cost of our deposits decreased from during to during the average balance of our borrowings decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   and the average cost of these borrowings decreased from during to during as a result  interest expense on our borrowings was million for the year ended december   or million and lower than our interest expense on borrowings of million during the year ended december  net interest income 
our net interest income increased by million  or  from million for to million for while our net interest rate spread decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   the average balance of our interest earning assets increased by million or  resulting in the increase in net interest income 
provision for loan losses 
our provision for loan losses increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  during  the percentage of our portfolio comprised of loans other than one to four family mortgage loans  which are deemed to have a greater risk of loss than one to four family loans  increased from at december  to 
table of contents of total loans 
our total allowance for loan losses as of december  was million  and is maintained at a level that represents our best estimate of losses in our loan portfolio at the balance sheet date which were both probable and reasonably estimable 
at december  our ratio of non performing loans to net loans was 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
accordingly  allowances for loan losses are based on management s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
we provide both general valuation allowances for unspecified  probable losses and specific valuation allowances for known losses in our portfolio 
general valuation allowances are added to our capital for purposes of calculating our regulatory risk based capital

as we continue to increase our origination of commercial business loans  consumer loans and commercial real estate loans  our provision for loan losses is likely to increase in future periods since such loans traditionally have a higher risk of loss than residential mortgage loans 
other income 
other income increased by  or million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  income from fees on deposit accounts increased by million  largely as a result of our increase in transaction deposit accounts 
fees for other banking services  which is comprised of insurance and annuity sales  trust fee income and appraisal income  increased by million 
gains on the sale of loans  which included a one time gain of million on the sale of million of loans  increased by million  as we began selling loans in the secondary market during offsetting these increases in other income was a million loss on the sale of securities as a result of restructuring our investment portfolio and a decrease in miscellaneous other income of  operating expense 
operating expense increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  of this increase  million is attributable to employee compensation and benefits 
employee health care costs increased by  pension costs increased by million and stock based compensation increased by  the remainder of the increase  million  was primarily attributable increased commissions paid to loan personnel due to increased loan production  increased commissions on increased insurance sales  normal salary increases and compensation paid to new employees 
during the year we hired new employees  bringing the total to full time equivalent employees at december  most of these employees are loan officers and related support personnel and customer service employees needed for our expanding branch network 
occupancy and equipment expense increased by million as we continue to expand the number of our branches and improve our technology 
miscellaneous expense increased by million 
included in this increase are additional costs of  for legal expense   for communications expense   in uncollected deposit overdrafts and fees  and  of additional loan closing costs absorbed to increase loan production

as stated above  the majority of our interest bearing liabilities and nearly all of our interest earning assets are held by fidelity federal bank trust and  therefore  nearly all of our interest rate risk is at the fidelity federal bank trust level 
we monitor interest rate risk by various methods  including gap analysis and analyzing changes in the net present value of our assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items our net portfolio value or npv which analysis  is reviewed with the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
we use an internal model that generates estimates of our npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
the model calculates npv essentially by discounting the cash flows from our assets and liabilities to present value using current market rates  and adjusting those discount rates accordingly for various interest rate scenarios 
the following table sets forth our estimated internal calculations of npv as of december   for instantaneous and parallel shifts in the yield curve in basis point increments up and down 
due to the low interest rate environment that existed at december   an analysis of a basis point downward shift in interest rates is not shown 
changes in rates net portfolio value basis points amount change change dollars in thousands bp bp bp in preparing the npv table above  we have estimated prepayment rates for our loans ranging from to  depending on the interest rate scenario and loan type 
these rates are management s best estimate based on prior repayment experience 

table of contents decay rates for liabilities indicate an assumed annual rate at which an interest bearing liability will be withdrawn in favor of an account with a more favorable interest rate 
decay rates have been assumed for interest bearing checking accounts  passbook and money market deposits 
we have used national decay rates calculated by a leading bank consulting firm and therefore may be different than the actual decay rates that we may experience 
the following decay rates were used for this analysis and the gap analysis which follows 
over year year year year year year year year year year ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten years interest bearing checking accounts passbook  club accounts money market deposit accounts the above assumptions are estimates of annual percentages based on remaining balances 
although management believes these deposit decay rates are a reasonable estimate of future deposit trends based on past performance  they should not be regarded as indicative of the actual prepayments and withdrawals that may be experienced by us in any given period 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv requires the making of certain assumptions that may or may not reflect how actual yields and costs respond to changes in market rates 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react differently to changes in market interest rates 
also  the changes in the contractual interest rates of our assets and liabilities may not occur at the same time as changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate arm loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the assets 
moreover  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the above table 
management also has made estimates of fair value discount rates that it believes to be reasonable 
however  because there is no quoted market for many of the assets and liabilities  there can be no assurance that the fair values presented would be indicative of the value negotiated in an actual sale 
while the above table provides an estimate of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  it is not intended to provide a precise forecast of the effect of market changes on our npv  as actual results may vary 
at december   we were not required by the office of thrift supervision to hold additional risk based capital for interest rate risk purposes 
we also monitor the matching of its assets and liabilities through gap analysis 
gap analysis attempts to measure the difference between the amount of interest earning assets expected to mature or reprice within a specific time period compared to the amount of interest bearing liabilities expected to mature or reprice within that period 
an interest rate sensitive gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specified period of time 
an interest rate sensitive gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities exceeds the amount of interest earnings assets maturing or repricing within a specified period of time 
gap analysis involves the use of numerous assumptions  as does npv 
generally  companies with a positive gap can expect net interest income to increase during periods of rising interest rates and decline in periods of falling interest rates 

table of contents the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as shown in the following table  our cumulative one year interest rate sensitivity gap at december  was a positive 
period to repricing more than more than one year to three years to within three four to twelve three five over five months months years years years dollars in thousands interest earning assets residential mortgage loans fixed rate adjustable rate commercial mortgage loans fixed rate adjustable rate other loans fixed rate adjustable rate mortgage backed securities fixed rate adjustable rate municipal bonds and government and agency securities fixed rate other interest earning assets adjustable total interest bearing liabilities deposits checking and funds transfer accounts passbook accounts money market accounts certificate accounts borrowings total excess deficiency of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities cumulative excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities cumulative excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities as a percent of total assets adjustable and floating rate assets are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due 
fixed rate assets are included in the periods in which they are scheduled to be repaid based on scheduled amortization 
in both cases  amounts are adjusted to reflect estimated prepayments 
for this table  all loans and mortgage backed securities were assigned a prepayment rate 
balances are shown net of loans in process and are not adjusted for premiums  discounts  reserves and unearned fees 
all of our deposits  other than certificates of deposit  are generally subject to immediate withdrawal 
however  in preparation of this table we used national decay rates calculated by a leading bank consulting firm 
these national decay rates consider a significant portion of these accounts to be core deposits having longer effective maturities based on the firm s calculations of national average deposit runoff 
these decay rates may be different than the actual decay rates we experienced 
certificate accounts and borrowings are assumed to have no prepayments and are shown in the period in which they contractually mature 
certain shortcomings are inherent in any methodology used to calculate interest rate sensitivity 
the asset prepayment speed and deposit decay rate assumptions are based on past experience and should not be regarded as indicative of the actual prepayments and withdrawals that may be experienced in any given period 
in the event of changes in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal would possibly deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the above table 
also  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react differently to changes in market interest rates 
certain assets such as adjustable rate mortgage loans have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 

table of contents in recent years our policy has been to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk generally by better matching the maturities of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  and by originating arm loans and other adjustable rate or short term loans  as well as by purchasing short term investments 
however  particularly in a low interest rate environment  borrowers typically prefer fixed rate loans to arm loans 
we do not solicit high rate jumbo certificates or brokered funds 
liquidity and capital resources fidelity federal bank trust is required to maintain liquid assets at levels considered safe and sound by the office of thrift supervision 
our liquidity ratio averaged  and during the months ended december   and  respectively 
our liquidity ratio averaged  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows  pay real estate taxes on mortgage loans  repay our borrowings and loan to fund commitments 
we also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability management objectives 
our primary sources of funds are deposits  amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage backed securities  maturities of investment securities and other short term investments  and earnings and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
we set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits 
in addition  we invest excess funds in short term interest earning and other assets  which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
short term interest earning deposits with the federal home loan bank of atlanta amounted to million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
other assets qualifying for liquidity purposes at december   and  totaled million  million and million  respectively 
for additional information about cash flows from our operating  financing  and investing activities  see consolidated statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements 
a major portion of our liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents  which are a product of our operating  investing and financing activities 
our primary sources of cash are net income  principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities  and increases in deposit accounts  along with advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  borrowing agreements exist with the federal home loan bank of atlanta which provides an additional source of funds 
at december   we had million in advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
we borrow from the federal home loan bank of atlanta in order to reduce interest rate risk  and for liquidity purposes 
at december   we had outstanding loan commitments of million to originate and or purchase mortgage loans

pension plans 
we maintain a qualified defined benefit plan the qualified plan  which covers substantially all employees who were hired prior to january  and a supplemental retirement plan to provide additional benefits to executives selected for the plan that are in excess of amounts permitted to be paid under the provisions of tax law to participants in the qualified plan 
we also sponsor a non qualified defined benefit plan for its directors 
our pension costs for all pension plans  excluding our k deferred savings plan  approximated million and million for and respectively  and is calculated based on a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on our qualified plan assets of 
in developing our expected long term rate of return assumption  we evaluated input from our actuaries and our investment advisors  including their review of asset class return expectations from respected sources and authorities 
we also evaluated the long term rate of expected inflation 
projected returns by these sources are based on broad equity and bond indices 
we also considered our historical returns in comparison to various market indices 
our expected long term rate of return is based on a target asset allocation of in equities and in fixed income 
we adopted this change in target allocation in early previously  our target allocation was equities and in fixed income investments 
at the end of  our pension committee decided to change asset managers for the defined benefit plan from security trust company  na to charles schwab trust company 
at december   of the million in plan assets  million were in cash and cash equivalents awaiting transfer to charles schwab trust company while the remaining million was in a debt securities mutual fund which transferred to charles schwab in kind 
after the transfer of assets was completed  the assets were invested in an allocation of approximately equity securities and debt securities 
we periodically rebalance the actual asset allocation to match the target asset allocation 
we expect a long term rate of return on equities of and a long term rate of return on fixed income investments of 
we believe this is a reasonable long term rate of return for our qualified plan assets 
we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions  including our expected rate of return  at least annually  and will adjust as necessary 

table of contents we base our determination of pension cost on the market value of assets without adjustments or smoothing to reduce year to year volatility 
actuarial gains and losses are recognized into pension cost  to the extent they exceed the amount allowed in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  that can be excluded in determining the amount to be amortized the corridor 
the amount of gain and loss in excess of the corridor is amortized over the remaining average expected working lifetime of plan participants  which was years for as of december   we had cumulative actuarial losses of million that had not yet been recognized into pension cost 
the discount rate we utilize for determining future pension obligations is based on a review of long term bond yields 
we use moody s aa bond index and merrill lynch s corporate years high quality bond index as of our measurement date in determining our discount rate each year 
the discount rate determined on this basis has decreased from as of december  to as of december  lowering the expected long term rate of return on our qualified plan assets by from to would have increased our fiscal pension cost by  lowering the discount rate and salary increase assumptions by would have increased our fiscal pension cost by the value of our qualified plan assets increased from million at december  to million at december  the investment performance returns and declining discount rates have decreased the under funding in our qualified plan  net of accumulated benefit obligations from million at december  to an underfunding of  at december  as a result of this decline in funded status of our qualified plan  we expect that based on our actuarial assumptions that we will continue to make cash contributions to the qualified plan of at least million for at least the next three years 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements of fidelity bankshares  inc and notes thereto  presented elsewhere herein  have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of fidelity federal bank trust s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of fidelity federal bank trust are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on fidelity federal bank trust s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as changes in the price of goods and services
