item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we anticipate that the regulation of our business operations under federal  state and local environmental regulations in the united states and abroad will increase over time 
we cannot estimate the impact of increased regulation on our operations  future capital expenditure requirements or the cost of compliance 
united states regulation 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla  also known as the superfund law  and comparable state laws generally impose joint and several liability for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons with respect to the release into the environment of substances designated under cercla as hazardous substances 
in the course of our operations  we may have generated and may generate wastes that fall within cercla s definition of hazardous substances 
we may be the owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released  and may have generated wastes that have been transported to offsite facilities 
we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up facilities at which such substances have been released by previous owners or operators and offsite facilities to which our wastes were transported 
the federal resource conservation and recovery act  as amended rcra  and comparable state laws  regulate the treatment  storage  disposal and transportation of wastes including those designated as hazardous wastes under rcra 
the epa and various state agencies have limited the disposal options for these wastes 
it is possible that our operations may generate wastes that are subject to rcra and comparable state statutes 
furthermore  wastes generated by our operations that are currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may be designated in the future as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes and  therefore  may be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements 
the clean water act cwa imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of wastes into waters of the united states  a term broadly defined 
the cwa  and comparable state laws  provide for civil  criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of hazardous substances and of other pollutants 
in the event of an unauthorized discharge of wastes  we may be liable for penalties and costs 
our operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health  principally the occupational safety and health act osha and its regulations 
the osha hazard communication standard  the epa community right to know regulations and similar state programs may require us to organize and or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with these applicable requirements 
mexico regulation 
our matamoros facility and its operations in mexico are subject to various environmental laws  regulations and ordinances promulgated by governmental authorities in mexico 
the ministry of the environment and natural resources secretariate de medio ambiente y recursos naturales semarnat is given overall responsibility for environmental regulation in mexico 
semarnat s responsibilities include enforcement of mexico s laws and regulations concerning air and water emissions and hazardous waste treatment  storage and disposal 
semarnat is given broad authority to enforce compliance with environmental laws and regulations and can require that operations be suspended pending completion of required remedial action 
licenses  permits and product registrations 
certain licenses  permits and product registrations are required for our products and operations in the united states  mexico and other countries in which we do business 
the licenses  permits and product registrations are subject to revocation  modification and renewal by governmental authorities 
in the united states in particular  producers and distributors of chemicals such as penta  creosote  tetrachlorvinphos and msma are subject to registration and notification requirements under federal law including under the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act fifra and the toxic substances control act  and comparable state law in order to sell those products in the united states 
compliance with these requirements has had  and in the future will continue to have  a material effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
under fifra  the registration system requires an ongoing submission to epa of substantial scientific research and testing data regarding the chemistry and toxicology of pesticide products by manufacturers 
under agreements with other industry participants  we share most research and testing costs pertaining to our chemical products 
we incurred expenses of approximately thousand in fiscal  thousand in  and thousand in in connection with the research  testing and other expenses in connection with our participation in several industry task forces

the future payment of dividends  however  will be within the discretion of the board of directors and depends on our profitability  capital requirements  financial condition  growth  business opportunities and other factors which our board of directors may deem relevant 
we repurchased no shares in fiscal on april   we sold  shares of common stock in a private placement 
tontine capital partners  lp purchased  shares  and terrier partners  lp purchased  shares 
the shares were purchased at a price of per share for an aggregate price of  we paid a fee of  and issued  treasury shares to boenning scattergood  inc  for acting as placement agent in connection with the offering

the purchased assets included product registrations and data  manufacturing equipment  and certain other assets 
the penta assets were acquired by basic chemicals company from vulcan materials company immediately prior to our purchase as part of a larger purchase of the chemicals business of vulcan materials company 
the purchase price was million  payable million in cash at closing  and a million promissory note 
the promissory note is payable in five equal annual principal installments of million plus interest at per annum 
see notes and to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  we made three acquisitions for a total purchase price of approximately million 
in december  we purchased certain penta distribution assets of wood protection products  inc as part of the purchase  we also granted an option to acquire  shares of our common stock  exercisable at per share 
the acquisition included distribution and plant equipment  inventory  penta product registrations and a consulting and non compete agreement with the seller s principal shareholder 
the cash purchase price was primarily financed with a million term loan 
see notes and to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in june  we purchased creosote product registrations from trenton sales  inc in connection with our purchase  we entered into a long term supply agreement with lufkin creosoting co  an affiliate of the seller  by which we will sell lufkin creosoting its creosote requirements for its wood treating operations 
we also obtained the seller s long term creosote supply agreement with a mexican producer of creosote 
although we had been purchasing creosote from the mexican creosote producer prior to the acquisition  the acquisition increased our purchases of that lower cost creosote supply 
we also purchased the ravap tradename and inventory from boehringer ingelheim vetmedica  inc in june that trade name is for a product that contains rabon  the animal health product registration line we acquired for million in fiscal  also from boehringer 
the creosote distribution and ravap acquisitions were completed using available cash  borrowings under our revolving loan and by increasing one of our senior term loans by million 
results of operations sales revenue and gross profit vs 
net sales revenue increased million  a increase in fiscal over fiscal increased pentachlorophenol penta sales accounted for about one third of the increase 
penta products are used principally to treat utility poles 
penta volume was up significantly for the year due to the penta acquisitions from basic chemicals late in fiscal and from wood protection products  inc wpp in december  which together had an impact of approximately million 
about one half of our increase in net sales revenue came from increased creosote sales  principally on increased volume 
major railroads continued to purchase treated wood crossties at the upper end of the normal range  and we benefited from the acquisition of creosote distribution assets from trenton sales  inc because we completed that acquisition in june  it did not have a significant impact on our net sales until fiscal net sales revenue from non wood treating products was also up in fiscal as compared with fiscal we saw increased volume in animal health product sales  both because of improved rabon sales and because of the ravap product acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal agricultural chemical sales also improved 
sales of these products are seasonal  and occur primarily in the second half of our fiscal year 
seasonal usage follows varying agricultural seasonal patterns  weather conditions and weather related pressure from pests  and customer marketing programs and requirements 
weather patterns can have an impact on our sales  particularly sales of agricultural products 
the end users of some of our products may  because of weather patterns  delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting season which may result in a reduction of the use of some products and therefore reduce our revenues and profitability 
the combined revenues from products subject to seasonal variations represent less than of our total annual revenues 
their peak selling season is during the last two quarters of the fiscal year  and revenue and profit are concentrated in these periods 
gross profit increased million in fiscal  and as a percent of sales in fiscal gross profit improved to from 
other companies may include certain of the costs that we record in cost of sales in selling  general and administrative expenses  and may include certain of the costs that we record in selling  general and administrative expenses as cost of sales 
as a result  our gross profit may not be comparable to that reported by other companies 
the margin improvement in fiscal came from increased volume of sales of higher margin penta products and from creosote price increases 
margins will continue to be impacted in fiscal by high penta raw material costs 
spending on penta raw materials chlorine and phenol in fiscal versus the average prices paid over the previous five years added approximately million to costs that year 
we have not been able to pass along the entire increased cost of these raw materials  and our margins on penta products have suffered 
we expect penta raw material costs will continue at high levels  maintaining pressure on our margins  throughout fiscal vs 
net sales revenue increased in fiscal over fiscal approximately half of the increase came from increased penta sales 
penta volume was up significantly on our acquisition of the wpp distribution business  which we estimate had an impact on revenue of approximately million 
penta sales revenue also improved over the prior year because of our june penta price increase  which had an impact of approximately million 
most of the remainder of our improved net sales revenue came from greater creosote sales volume because of increased demand by the major railroads for crossties treated with creosote 
net sales revenue from non wood treating products was up in fiscal as compared with fiscal  because of greater animal health products volume 
we acquired animal health products for the first time in mid fiscal  and first had the benefit of a full selling season fiscal gross profit as a percent of sales in fiscal declined to from 
in december  we entered a long term supply agreement with the other united states penta producer in order to support the increased sales volume resulting from our acquisition of the distribution business of wpp 
although we have since purchased that penta business from basic chemicals  purchases of penta blocks from the other producer adversely affected penta margins in fiscal because that product was more costly than the penta blocks we produced 
margins were also impacted in fiscal by the higher penta raw material costs that first began to impact us in may gross margins on wood treating products were also adversely impacted by increased creosote costs for imported product and by a greater reliance in fiscal than in fiscal on higher cost imported creosote 
selling  general and administrative expenses vs 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million higher than the prior year  a increase 
selling and distribution expenses increased in fiscal by about million on greater penta and creosote sales volume from acquisitions 
performance based incentive compensation and the addition of a chief operating officer increased executive expenses relative to the prior year periods by approximately thousand  amortization of intangibles associated with our acquisitions in the last two fiscal years contributed approximately thousand  and product regulatory expense increased thousand 
vs 
for fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses were million higher than the prior year  an increase 
distribution expenses associated with wood treating products increased approximately thousand  and selling expense increased thousand in fiscal  in each case primarily because of volume increases 
amortization expense increased thousand  and product regulatory expenses increased thousand  in each case primarily as a result of our completed acquisitions 
interest expense interest expense was thousand in fiscal compared with thousand in fiscal and thousand in fiscal the increases have been due to increases in term loan borrowings to complete our acquisitions in wood treating chemicals and animal health products 
gain on sale of securities we sold marketable securities held in a financial institution for a gain of thousand in fiscal income taxes our effective tax rate was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal segment information segment data segment data is presented for our four segments at july also see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues penta creosote animal health agricultural chemicals depreciation and amortization penta creosote animal health agricultural chemicals income loss from operations penta creosote animal health agricultural chemicals sales revenue penta segment net sales revenues increased million in fiscal from million in fiscal  or a increase  primarily on additional volume from our penta acquisitions from basic chemicals late in fiscal and from wpp in december we believe that the two acquisitions increased penta segment revenues approximately million in fiscal over creosote segment revenues increased million in fiscal from million in fiscal  a increase 
approximately million of the increase was the result of greater volume in fiscal major railroads continued to demand treated railroad ties at the upper end of the normal range 
we also benefited from our acquisition of a creosote distribution assets in late fiscal animal health segment sales revenues increased million in the year from million in the prior year  or a increase on greater volume 
approximately of the increase was due to the acquisition of the ravap product line  and we benefited from improved market acceptance of our rabon products 
sales revenue in agricultural chemicals was also up thousand from million in fiscal  or 
the increase came about equally on greater volume and on higher prices 
income loss from operations income from penta segment operations increased by million  or  in fiscal over the prior year based on higher revenue 
penta segment costs continue to be under pressure from high raw material prices 
in fiscal  creosote segment income from operations was up million from the prior year  or  most of which was attributable to price increases 
animal health segment income was up thousand over the prior year  a increase 
segment volume was up  but increased sales and distribution expense  and amortization of the ravap trade name reduced the effect of the greater volume 
although agricultural chemicals continued to show an operating loss in fiscal  the loss narrowed to thousand  about equally attributable to volume and price increases 
outlook for fiscal we believe that our products profitability will experience continued pressure during fiscal from high raw material costs  and that we will be unable to fully pass these increases on to our customers 
our spending on penta raw materials in fiscal is projected to be million higher than if we were able to purchase those raw materials at their average price from to although  our processes are not energy intensive  the recent increase in oil prices directly and indirectly impact the cost of our feedstocks  as well as our utility costs and transportation costs 
however  the acquisition in fiscal of the other penta supplier will offset the negative impact these costs will have on our results 
the other penta supplier s assets were acquired in june if the acquisition had occured at the beginning of fiscal  we believe it would have added an estimated 
per share to earnings in fiscal our wood treating customers are experiencing strong demand from major railroads for railroad crossties 
we expect that creosote sales will continue to be strong throughout fiscal although investor owned utilities appear to be continuing to defer utility pole purchases where possible  hurricane katrina appears to have increased the demand for utility poles to replace damage 
our creosote terminal near new orleans was not damaged during that hurricane  however  we experienced some supply chain disruption and associated costs after the storm 
inflation did not have a material impact on us in the last three fiscal years and is not expected to have a material impact on us in the future 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows net cash from operating activities was million in fiscal net income and the adjustment for depreciation and amortization accounted for million of cash from operations in fiscal accounts receivable were up million on higher sales revenue  but inventories were down million at year end on tighter management controls 
accrued liabilities increased cash approximately thousand  equally attributable to performance based compensation increases and estimated tax payments 
net cash used by investing activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal we used net cash to complete acquisitions in penta in fiscal and in penta  creosote distribution and animal health in fiscal our purchases totaled million in and million in we added million in net cash from financing activities in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal we sold million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the net proceeds from the sale were million 
to finance our acquisition of the penta business from basic chemicals  we incurred million in seller financed indebtedness 
principal repayments on indebtedness in fiscal were million 
in fiscal we borrowed million in a refinancing of our senior credit facility to finance acquisitions  and repaid thousand during the year 
we also paid dividends of thousand in fiscal and thousand in fiscal it is our policy to pay out dividends from available cash  after taking into consideration our profitability  capital requirements  financial condition  growth  business opportunities and other factors which our board of directors may deem relevant 
working capital we have a working capital line of credit under a revolving credit facility with wachovia bank national association which acquired our former lender  southtrust bank  but at the end of fiscal and at september  we had no borrowings under that facility 
under that credit facility  we may borrow up to the lesser of million or the sum of of eligible accounts receivable plus a portion of our inventory 
the amount available under the facility at the end of fiscal and at september  was million 
the revolving credit facility contains representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants  including a limitation that without consent our equity investments or loans cannot exceed thousand 
the revolving credit facility also requires that we satisfy the same financial covenants as our two term loans 
the revolving credit facility has a term ending in december  we anticipate no difficulties in renewing that facility 
long term obligations our purchase of the other supplier s penta business in fiscal was paid for in part by a million promissory note payable to the seller 
the promissory note is payable in five equal annual principal installments of million plus interest at per annum 
the first installment is payable on june   and subsequent installments are payable on the same date each year thereafter until the promissory note is paid 
the principal balance of the promissory note was million on september  and at the end of fiscal our purchase of the rabon animal health products business in fiscal and our acquisitions in fiscal were financed in part by two term loans under a senior credit facility with southtrust bank  which has been acquired by wachovia bank national association 
the aggregate principal balance of the two term loans was million at september  and million at the end of fiscal one term loan is being amortized monthly over ten years but the maturity date is december  the loan carries interest at a varying rate equal to libor plus  however  in february  we entered into an interest rate swap transaction with our lender which effectively fixed the interest rate at for the remainder of the term 
the principal balance outstanding on that loan was million at the end of fiscal our second term loan was in the original principal amount of million  but it was refinanced in june to reflect an additional million advance to fund acquisitions 
the principal amount of that loan is being repaid monthly over seven years at varying installment amounts  but the maturity date is june  the second term loan carries interest at a varying rate initially equal to libor plus 
the margin over libor is dependent upon a financial leverage ratio and can vary between and 
for fiscal  the margin over libor for this term loan is expected to be between and 
the principal amount of the loan was million at the end of fiscal the two term loans require us to satisfy certain financial covenants  but those covenants were amended in june the amendment eliminated minimum tangible net worth and liabilities to tangible net worth requirements  and revised our required coverage ratio of debt to earnings before interest  taxes  and depreciation 
the revised requirement is that our coverage ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  and depreciation be not greater than to as of july  and october   and not greater than to as of january  and at all times thereafter 
we believe that our working capital  the seller financed indebtedness  the term loans and the revolving credit facility adequately provide for our anticipated need for liquidity and capital resources in fiscal for our current operations 
capital expenditures in fiscal our capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were approximately thousand  of which thousand was recovered through an insurance policy claim 
in fiscal  our capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were approximately thousand 
about of our expenditures were incurred to dismantle and move the penta formulation and distribution equipment acquired from wood protection products and to purchase an additional six acres of land next to our plant in mexico for possible future expansion 
our capital expenditures and operating expenses for environmental matters  excluding testing  data submission and other costs associated with our product task force participation  were approximately thousand in fiscal  thousand in fiscal  and thousand in fiscal we estimate that our capital expenditures and operating expenses for environmental matters  other than testing  data submission and other costs associated with our product task force participation  will be approximately thousand in fiscal we expensed approximately thousand for testing  data submission and other costs associated with our participation in product task forces in fiscal  and approximately thousand and thousand in fiscal and  respectively 
the increasing expense was due to increased activity in the product reauthorization process being conducted by the epa and the addition of the rabon product line in december epa s work plan for its fiscal year ending september includes consideration of creosote  penta and msma for re registration 
for those reasons  we believe that total testing  data submission and other costs will be approximately million in fiscal since environmental laws have traditionally become increasingly stringent  costs and expenses relating to environmental control and compliance may increase in the future 
while we do not believe that the incremental cost of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations  there can be no assurance that costs of compliance will not exceed current estimates 
contractual obligations our obligations to make future payments under contracts as of july  are summarized in the following table 
total long term debt operating leases other long term liabilities purchase obligations estimated interest payments on debt estimated payments receipts under interest rate swap post retirement benefit obligations are included 
amounts estimated payments based on forecast interest rates as of september off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  such as financing or unconsolidated variable interest entities 
new accounting rules in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised fas r  accounting for share based payments 
fas r requires all entities to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments  such as stock options granted to employees 
the company plans to apply fas r on a modified prospective method 
under this method  the company is required to record compensation expense as previous awards continue to vest for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
for public entities that do not file as small business issuers  fas r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  management has not completed its evaluation of the effect that fas r will have  but believes that the effect of the statement will be consistent with the application disclosed in its pro forma disclosures 
in november  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 which revised arb no 
 relating to inventory costs 
this revision is to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
this statement requires that these items be recognized as a current period charge regardless of whether they meet the criterion specified in arb in addition  this statement requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  management is evaluating the effect  if any  the statement will have on the financial statements of the company once adopted 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes error corrections  which replaced apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
this statement changes the requirements for accounting and reporting of a voluntary change in accounting principle and changes required by an accounting pronouncement when the specific transition provisions are absent 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle 
if it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effect or the cumulative effect of the change  this statement requires that the new accounting principle be adopted prospectively from the earliest practicable date 
sfas no 
is effective in the period that begins after december   and early adoption is permitted in the fiscal years beginning after sfas no 
was issued 
the company does not expect the new statement will have any material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting principles that we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding our financial results are the following revenue recognition in general  the company has only one revenue recognition transaction in which our chemical products sold in the open market are recognized as revenue when risk of loss and title to the products transfers to customers  which usually occurs at the time a shipment is made 
cost of sales cost of sales includes inbound freight charges  purchasing and receiving costs  inspection costs and internal transfer costs 
in the case of products manufactured by the company  direct and indirect manufacturing costs and associated plant administrative expenses are included as well as laid in cost of raw materials consumed in the manufacturing process 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for accounts receivable we believe we may not collect in full 
a provision for bad debt expense recorded to selling  general and administrative expenses increases the allowance 
accounts receivable that are written off our books decrease the allowance 
the amount of bad debt expense recorded each period and the resulting adequacy of the allowance at the end of each period are determined using a combination of our historical loss experience  customer by customer analyses of our accounts receivable balances each period and subjective assessments of our future bad debt exposure 
write offs of accounts receivable balances have been insignificant historically 
inventories inventories consist primarily of raw materials and finished goods that we hold for sale in the ordinary course of business 
it uses the first in  first out method to value inventories at the lower of cost or market 
management believes we have not incurred impairments in the carrying value of our inventories 
goodwill and other intangible assets the initial recording of goodwill and other intangibles requires estimation of the fair value of assets and liabilities using fair value measurements  which include quoted market price  present value techniques estimate of future cash flows  and other valuation techniques 
additionally  sfas requires goodwill and other intangible assets to be reviewed for possible impairment on an annual basis  or if circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist 
determining fair value and the implied fair value is judgmental and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the recording of intangible assets  whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of the impairment charge 
the company s estimates of fair value are primarily determined using present value techniques of projected future cash flows 
this approach uses significant assumptions such as multi year sales projections with associated expenses 
the company has performed impairment analyses on its goodwill and intangible assets of indefinite life which indicated as of july  an impairment charge was not appropriate 
impairment of long lived assets we review periodically the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of at least annually or when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of long lived assets is evaluated for potential impairment on a product line basis 
we have concluded on the basis of our evaluation that our long lived assets are not impaired
