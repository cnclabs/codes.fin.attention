the excess reserve for these sites of  was reversed against cost of sales in critical accounting policies the preparation of this annual report requires management s judgment to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
twin disc s significant accounting policies are described in note a to the consolidated financial statements on pages through of this form 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective  or complex judgments or estimates 
however  the policies management considers most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are the following revenue recognition twin disc recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title 
while we respect the customer s right to return products that were shipped in error  historical experience shows those types of adjustments have been immaterial and thus no provision is made 
with respect to other revenue recognition issues  management has concluded that its policies are appropriate and in accordance with the guidance provided by securities and exchange commissions staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
accounts receivable twin disc performs ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjusts credit limits based on payment history and the customer s credit worthiness as determined by review of current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues 
in addition  senior management reviews the accounts receivable aging on a monthly basis to determine if any receivable balances may be uncollectible 
although our accounts receivable are dispersed among a large customer base  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of our largest customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and future operating results 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost has been determined by the last in  first out lifo method for the majority of the inventories located in the united states  and by the first in  first out fifo method for all other inventories 
management specifically identifies obsolete products and analyzes historical usage  forecasted production based on future orders  demand forecasts  and economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
the adjustments to the reserve are estimates that could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from the actual requirements if future economic conditions  customer demand or competitive conditions differ from expectations 
warranty twin disc engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its suppliers 
however  its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  the extent of the market affected by the failure and the expense involved in satisfactorily addressing the situation 
the warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for warranty costs  management takes into consideration the term of the warranty coverage  historical claim rates and costs of repair  knowledge of the type and volume of new products and economic trends 
while we believe the warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable in the future could differ materially from what actually transpires 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate must be estimated 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure and assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets 
if it is deemed more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized  a valuation a llowance is recorded

fsp states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas based on our analysis to date  we are not in a position to decide on whether  or to what extent  we might repatriate foreign earnings under the provision of the jobs act 
however  we expect to be in a position to finalize our assessment by june it is not expected that this will have a significant impact on the company s financial statements

the maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions 
gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in other income expense  net in the consolidated statement of operations as the changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized and generally offset the gains and losses on the hedged items in the same period
