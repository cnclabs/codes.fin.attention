in  we did not incur any impairment charges 
in june  we completed an assessment of the carrying value of certain long lived assets in the electronics business 
as a result of this assessment  we recorded a pretax charge of million as a component of restructuring and asset impairment charges 
the charge was a result of price declines caused by persistent global overcapacity and low cost asia competition

these programs were established to develop centers of excellence in functional areas and enable long term growth and competitive advantages 
estimated cost savings related to these programs are approximately million annually 
all costs associated with the integration have been incurred  and the remaining cash payments for certain lease costs extend into kennametal integration restructuring program this program includes employee severance costs associated with existing kennametal facilities and resulted in total restructuring charges of million million in and million in we completed and paid all remaining costs associated with this program in cash expenditures in were million 

table of contents widia integration plan this program included facility rationalizations and employee severance costs associated with acquired widia facilities 
costs incurred under this plan were accounted for under eitf  recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
as a result  these costs were recorded as part of the widia purchase price allocation 
total adjustments to goodwill of million were recorded million in and million in cash expenditures related to this program of million  million and million were made during  and  respectively 
see note amortization of intangibles amortization expense increased million to million in from million in the increase is primarily attributable to the conforma clad inc conforma clad and extrude hone acquisitions 
amortization expense decreased million to million in from million in the decrease is primarily attributable to a million decrease for certain non compete agreements being fully amortized in interest expense interest expense was million in compared with million in the increase in interest expense is due to higher average borrowing rates in the weighted average domestic borrowing rate increased from percent in to percent in the portion of our debt subject to variable rates of interest remained stable at approximately percent at june  and interest expense was million in compared with million in the decrease in interest expense was due to total debt  including capital leases and notes payable  declining from million at june  to million at june   and lower average borrowing rates 
the weighted average domestic borrowing rate decreased from percent in to percent in in addition  the portion of our debt subject to variable rates of interest decreased from approximately percent at june  to approximately percent at june  other income  net in  other income  net increased by million to million compared to million in the increase is primarily attributable to favorable foreign currency effects of million and an increase in interest income of million

other income  net for and included fees of million and million  respectively  related to the accounts receivable securitization program 
in  other income  net decreased by million to million compared to million in the decrease was primarily attributable to increases in foreign exchange losses of million and decreases in interest income of million offset by a million pretax gain related to the sale of our investment in toshiba tungaloy

income taxes the effective tax rate for was percent compared to percent for the increase in the effective rate from to was primarily driven by the negative impact of a german tax law change enacted in december of and non deductible goodwill written off in association with the fss divestiture  partially offset by changes in valuation allowances in europe 
the company is implementing an enhanced pan european centralized business model  which will involve the establishment of a principal company 
in this structure  key management decision making and responsibility will be centralized in the principal company that will have the responsibility to drive all strategic and operational initiatives of the european business 
current manufacturing and sales operations will be transformed into contract manufacturers and limited risk distributors 
service functions will also be organized into separate units 
this will allow these functions to intensify their focus on and increase their efficiency in production  sales growth and supporting services  following clearly defined and uniform processes as directed by the principal company 
this strategy is expected to be complete in the first half of fiscal on october   the american jobs creation act of was enacted 
the company is currently evaluating what effect this legislation will have on its effective tax rate  including the effect of a provision within the act that provides for a special one time tax deduction of percent of foreign earnings that are repatriated to the united states  as defined by the act 
the company expects to complete this evaluation during the second quarter of fiscal the company is considering repatriating  under the act  an amount between and million  which would result in an estimated tax cost between and million 
until its evaluation is completed  the unremitted earnings of the company s foreign investments continue to be considered permanently reinvested  and accordingly  no deferred tax liability has been established 

table of contents the company expects the effective tax rate to increase slightly in  excluding any effect of the american jobs creation act of provision with respect to repatriating foreign earnings to the united states 
the unfavorable impact of the recent tax legislation enacted in germany is expected to have a greater impact than the favorable impact from operating within the new european business model in in addition  adoption of sfas r  share based payment revised sfas r  is expected to have an unfavorable impact on the effective tax rate from expensing of incentive stock options

we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  for compared to million  or per diluted share  for the increase was primarily attributable to organic sales growth  cost containment  a decrease in restructuring cost  favorable foreign currency translation effects  a decrease in interest expense and the widia acquisition  which included efficiencies derived from the integration with kennametal operations 
these improvements were offset  in part  by increased pricing pressure and unfavorable product mix shifts  higher raw material costs and increased employee benefit costs in business segment review prior to the fss segment divestiture in  our operations were organized into four global business units consisting of mssg  amsg  j l and fss  and corporate

liquidity and capital resources our cash flow from operations is the primary source of financing for capital expenditures and internal growth 
the most significant risk associated with our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations is the overall level of demand for our products 
however  we believe we can adequately control costs and manage our working capital to meet our cash flow needs  throughout changes in the economic cycle 

table of contents in october  we entered into a five year  multi currency  revolving credit facility with a group of financial institutions credit agreement  which amended our credit agreement discussed below 
the credit agreement permits revolving credit loans of up to million for working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 
the credit agreement allows for borrowings in us dollars  euro  canadian dollars  pound sterling and japanese yen 
interest payable under the credit agreement is based upon the type of borrowing under the facility and may be libor plus an applicable margin  the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus percent or fixed as negotiated by the company 
the credit agreement contains various covenants with which we must be in compliance  including two financial covenants a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio as those terms are defined in the agreement 
as of june   outstanding borrowings under this agreement were million 
as of june   million of these borrowings were denominated in us dollars and million were denominated in euro 
we had the ability to borrow under the agreement  or otherwise incur  additional debt of up to million as of june   and be in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio financial covenant 
at june   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
in june  we entered into a three year  multi currency  million revolving bank credit facility with a group of financial institutions credit agreement 
following a review of anticipated borrowing requirements  in june  we notified the administrative agent of our decision to permanently reduce the credit agreement from million to million  resulting in lower facility fees for the remaining two years of the agreement 
the credit agreement allowed for borrowings in us dollars  euro  canadian dollars  pound sterling or japanese yen 
the credit agreement contained various covenants with which we must be in compliance  including three financial covenants a maximum leverage ratio  a maximum fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum consolidated net worth 
as of june   outstanding borrowings under this agreement were million 
as of june   million of these borrowings were denominated in us dollars and million were denominated in euro 
the credit agreement was amended by the credit agreement 
additionally  we generally obtain local financing through credit lines with commercial banks in the various countries in which we operate 
at june   these borrowings amounted to million for notes payable and million for term debt and capital leases 
we believe that cash flow from operations and the availability under our credit lines will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements over the next months 
based upon our debt structure at june  and  approximately percent of our debt was exposed to floating rates of interest  which is consistent with our target range for floating versus fixed interest rate debt 
we periodically review the target range and the strategies designed to maintain the mix of floating to fixed interest rate debt within that range 
in the future  we may decide to adjust the target range or the strategies to achieve it 
following is a summary of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of june  in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt notes payable pension benefit payments postretirement benefit payments capital leases operating leases purchase obligations total long term debt includes interest obligations of million

during  we generated million in cash flow from operations  an increase of million  or percent  compared to net income plus non cash items improved million to million in compared to million in this improvement was offset by a million reduction in cash flow from changes in operating working capital items 
this change was due to increased accounts receivable and inventory as a result of increased sales and net repayments of our accounts receivable securitization program resulting from the fss divestiture 
net cash used for investing activities was million in  an increase of million from million in the change is due primarily to a million increase in spending on acquisitions 
this year s net cash used for investing activities includes million related to the extrude hone acquisition  while last year s total includes million related to the conforma clad acquisition 
the remaining change is due primarily to an increase in capital expenditures of million in  a portion of which supported our growth in china and india  increased proceeds from divestitures of million in and receiving million in proceeds from the sale of our investment in toshiba tungaloy in we have projected our capital expenditures for to be approximately million  which will be used primarily to support new strategic initiatives  new products and to upgrade machinery and equipment 
we believe this level of capital spending is sufficient to maintain competitiveness and improve productivity 
net cash used for financing activities was million in compared to million in this fluctuation was due primarily to reductions in net debt repayments including notes payable of million and increased cash inflows from dividend reinvestment and employee benefit and stock plans of million 
off balance sheet arrangements since  we have had an agreement with a financial institution whereby we securitized  on a continuous basis  an undivided interest in a specific pool of our domestic trade accounts receivable 
we were permitted to securitize up to million of accounts receivable under this agreement 
in july  we entered into a new securitization program securitization program  which also permitted us to securitize up to million of accounts receivable 
the securitization program was amended on september   permitting us to securitize up to million of accounts receivable 
the securitization program provides for a co purchase arrangement  whereby two financial institutions participate in the purchase of our accounts receivable 
pursuant to this agreement  we  and certain of our domestic subsidiaries  sell our domestic accounts receivable to kennametal receivables corporation krc  a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote subsidiary 
a bankruptcy remote subsidiary is a company that has been structured to make it highly unlikely that it would be drawn into a bankruptcy of kennametal inc  or any of our other subsidiaries 
krc was formed to purchase these accounts receivable and sell participating interests in such accounts receivable to the financial institutions  which in turn purchase and receive ownership and security interests in those assets 
as collections reduce the amount of accounts receivable included in the pool  we sell new accounts receivable to krc  which in turn securitizes these new accounts receivable with the financial institutions 
the actual amount of accounts receivable securitized each month is a function of the net change new billings less collections in the specific pool of domestic accounts receivable  the impact of detailed eligibility requirements in the agreement eg  the aging  terms of payment  quality criteria and customer concentrations  and the application of various reserves which are typical in trade receivable securitization transactions 
a decrease in the amount of eligible accounts receivable could result in our inability to continue to securitize all or a portion of our accounts receivable 
it is not unusual  however  for the amount of our eligible accounts receivable to vary by up to million to million per month 
the financial institutions charge us fees based on the level of accounts receivable securitized under this agreement and the commercial paper market rates plus the financial institutions cost to administer the program 
the costs incurred under this program  million  million and million in  and  respectively  are accounted for as a component of other income  net and represent attractive funding costs compared to existing bank and public debt transactions 
at june  and  we securitized accounts receivable of million and million  respectively  under this program 
our subordinated retained interests in accounts receivable available for securitization and recorded as a component of accounts receivable were million and million at june  and  respectively 

table of contents the securitization program is a three year program  which contains certain provisions that require annual approval 
it is our intention to continuously obtain such approval when required 
non renewal of this securitization program would result in our requirement to otherwise finance the amounts securitized 
we anticipate that the risk of non renewal of this securitization program with the current providers or some other providers is low 
in the event of a decrease of our eligible accounts receivable or non renewal or non annual approval of our securitization program  we would have to utilize alternative sources of capital to fund that portion of our working capital needs 
we anticipate renewing the program in june and will determine at that time whether the economics favor an annual or multi year renewal 
financial condition at june   total assets were  million  compared to  million at june  working capital was million at june   an increase of percent from million for  primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and cash and reductions in current maturities of long term debt and capital leases and accrued restructuring 
at june   other assets were million  an increase of million from million at june  the increase is primarily related to the increase in goodwill and intangible assets of million mainly as a result of the extrude hone acquisition 
total liabilities increased million from  million at june  to  million at june  this increase is due primarily to the increase in accrued pension benefits of million due to the increase in our unfunded pension obligations and related increase in additional minimum pension liability 
shareowners equity was million at june   an increase of million from the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to net income of million and the effect of employee stock and benefit plan activity of million partially offset by a charge to equity of million related to the increase in additional minimum pension liability and cash dividends of million

this purchase price includes the actual purchase price of million  plus direct acquisition costs of million  less million of acquired cash 
extrude hone supplies market leading engineered component process technology to customers in a variety of industries around the world 
this process technology focuses on component deburring  polishing and producing controlled radii 
we financed the acquisition with borrowings under our credit agreement 
extrude hone s operating results have been included in our consolidated results since march  and are included in the amsg segment see notes and 
we continue to evaluate new opportunities that allow for the expansion of existing product lines into new market areas  either directly or indirectly through joint ventures  where appropriate 
environmental matters we are currently named as a prp at the li tungsten superfund site in glen cove  new york 
in december  we recorded a remediation reserve with respect to our involvement in these matters 
this reserve represents our best estimate of the undiscounted future obligation based on our evaluations and discussions with outside counsel and independent consultants  and the current facts and circumstances related to these matters 
we recorded this liability because certain events occurred  including the identification of other prps  an assessment of potential remediation solutions and direction from the government for the remedial action plan  that clarified our level of involvement in these matters and our relationship to other prps 
this led us to conclude that it was probable that a liability had been incurred 
at june   we had an accrual of million recorded relative to this environmental issue 
in addition to the amount currently reserved  we may be subject to loss contingencies related to these matters estimated to be up to an additional million 
we believe that such undiscounted unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence 
the reserved and unreserved liabilities for all environmental concerns could change substantially in the near term due to factors such as the nature and extent of contamination  changes in remedial requirements  technological changes  discovery of new information  the financial strength of other prps  the identification of new prps  and the involvement of and direction taken by the government on these matters 
additionally  we also maintain reserves for other potential environmental issues associated with our domestic operations and a location operated by our german subsidiary 
at june   the total of these accruals was million and represents anticipated costs associated with the remediation of these issues 
cash payments of million were made against this reserve during the year 

table of contents as a result of the widia acquisition  we previously established an environmental reserve used for environmental cleanup and remediation activities at several widia manufacturing locations 
this liability represents our estimate of the future obligation based on our evaluations and discussions with independent consultants and the current facts and circumstances related to these matters 
at june   we had an accrual of million recorded relative to these environmental exposures 
cash payments of million were made against this reserve during we also have recorded unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustments of million during we maintain a corporate eh s department  as well as an eh s policy committee  to ensure compliance with environmental regulations and to monitor and oversee remediation activities 
in addition  we have established an eh s administrator at each of our global manufacturing facilities 
our financial management team periodically meets with members of the corporate eh s department and the corporate legal department to review and evaluate the status of environmental projects and contingencies 
on a quarterly basis  we establish or adjust financial provisions and reserves for environmental contingencies in accordance with sfas effects of inflation despite modest inflation in recent years  rising costs  in particular the cost of certain raw materials  continue to affect our operations throughout the world 
we strive to minimize the effects of inflation through cost containment  productivity improvements and price increases under highly competitive conditions 
discussion of critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we make judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in our financial statements 
as part of our financial reporting process  our management collaborates to determine the necessary information on which to base our judgments and develops estimates used to prepare the financial statements 
we use historical experience and available information to make these judgments and estimates 
however  different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and in light of different facts and circumstances 
therefore  actual amounts could differ from the estimates reflected in our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon shipment of our products 
our general conditions of sale explicitly state that the delivery of our products is fob shipping point and that title and all risks of loss and damages pass to the buyer upon delivery of the sold products to the common carrier 
our general conditions of sale explicitly state that acceptance of the conditions of shipment is considered to have occurred unless written notice of objection is received by kennametal within calendar days of the date specified on the invoice 
we do not ship product unless we have documentation authorizing shipment to our customers 
our products are consumed by our customers in the manufacture of their products 
historically  we have experienced very low levels of returned product and do not consider the effect of returned product to be material 
we have recorded an estimated returned goods allowance to provide for any potential product returns 
we warrant that products and services sold are free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service when correctly installed  used and maintained 
this warranty terminates days after delivery of the product to the customer  and does not apply to products that have been subjected to misuse  abuse  neglect or improper storage  handling or maintenance 
products may be returned to kennametal only after inspection and approval by kennametal and upon receipt by customer of shipping instructions from kennametal 
we have included an estimated allowance for warranty returns in our returned goods allowance discussed above 
prior to the divestiture in  fss management contracts contained two major deliverables product procurement and inventory management 
under the fixed fee contracts  we recognized revenue evenly over the contract term 
revenue was recognized upon shipment for cost plus contracts 
accounting for contingencies we accrue for contingencies in accordance with sfas when it is probable that a liability or loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require the exercise of judgment both in assessing whether or not a liability or loss has been incurred and estimating the amount of probable loss 
the significant contingencies affecting our financial statements include environmental  health and safety matters and litigation 
long lived assets as required under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the recoverability of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill that are amortized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any such assets may not be fully recoverable 
changes in circumstances include technological advances  changes in our business model  capital structure  economic conditions or operating performance 
our evaluation is based upon  among other things  our assumptions about the estimated future undiscounted cash flows these assets are 
table of contents expected to generate 
when the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  we will recognize an impairment loss 
we continually apply our best judgment when performing these evaluations to determine the timing of the testing  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability and the fair value of the asset 
goodwill and other intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles of each of our reporting units as required under sfas by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
the fair values of our reporting units are determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples based upon historical and projected financial information 
we apply our best judgment when assessing the reasonableness of the financial projections used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefits we sponsor these types of benefit plans for a majority of our employees and retirees 
we account for these plans as required under sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
accounting for the cost of these plans requires the estimation of the cost of the benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the expected work life of employees participating in these plans 
this estimation requires our judgment about the discount rate used to determine these obligations  expected return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases  rate of future health care costs  withdrawal and mortality rates and participant retirement age 
differences between our estimates and actual results may significantly affect the cost of our obligations under these plans 
in the valuation of our pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit liabilities  management utilizes various assumptions 
we determine our discount rate based on an investment grade bond yield curve with a duration that approximates the benefit payment timing of each plan 
this rate can fluctuate based on changes in investment grade bond yields 
the long term rate of return on plan assets is estimated based on an evaluation of historical returns for each asset category held by the plans  coupled with the current and short term mix of the investment portfolio 
the historical returns are adjusted for expected future market and economic changes 
this return will fluctuate based on actual market returns and other economic factors 
the rate of future health care costs is based on historical claims and enrollment information projected over the next fiscal year and adjusted for administrative charges 
this rate is expected to decrease until fiscal future compensation rates  withdrawal rates  and participant retirement age are determined based on historical information 
these assumptions are not expected to significantly change 
mortality rates are determined based on review of published mortality tables 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the creditworthiness of our customers based on multiple sources of information and analyze such factors as our historical bad debt experiences  industry and geographic concentrations of credit risk  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
if the financial condition of our customers was to worsen  additional allowances may be required  resulting in future operating losses that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts at june  inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we use the last in  first out method for determining the cost of a significant portion of our us inventories 
the cost of the remainder of inventories is determined under the first in  first out or average cost methods 
when market conditions indicate an excess of carrying costs over market value  a lower of cost or market provision is recorded 
excess and obsolete inventory reserves are established based upon our evaluation of the quantity of inventory on hand relative to demand 
income taxes realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income  the timing and amount of which are uncertain in part due to the expected profitability of certain foreign subsidiaries 
as of june   the deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances are primarily attributable to postretirement benefits  inventory reserves and net operating loss carryforwards 
in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an increase in the valuation allowance would be required 
new accounting standards in july  the company adopted fasb staff position fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp 
fsp provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the act for employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide prescription drug benefits and requires those employers to provide certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy 
see note for discussion of the effect of adoption of this fsp and required disclosures 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas r 
sfas r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r eliminates the alternative to use the intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in sfas  which generally resulted in no compensation expense recorded in the financial statements related to the issuance of stock options under the company s stock and incentive plan 
sfas r requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
this standard established fair value based measurement method in accounting for generally all share based payment transactions with employees 
the company adopted sfas r effective july  the company is required to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
beginning july   the company recorded stock based compensation expense for the cost of stock options and restricted stock issued under the stock and incentive plan 
pretax stock based compensation expense for related to unvested awards as of july  and awards granted to date in is estimated to be approximately million 
sfas r requires that stock based compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service substantive vesting period 
the company s stock and incentive plan provides that stock option awards for employees and directors vest up to years after retirement and restricted stock awards vest immediately upon retirement for employees and directors 
in periods prior to the adoption of sfas r pro forma disclosure only  the company recorded stock based compensation for awards to retirement eligible employees over the awards stated vesting period nominal vesting period 
with the adoption of sfas r  the company will continue to follow the nominal vesting period approach for the unvested portion of awards granted before the adoption of sfas r and follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after the adoption of sfas r 
the transition to the substantive vesting approach did not have a material impact on pro forma disclosures previously made under sfas in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this standard clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of certain manufacturing costs and was effective for the company beginning after july  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision with the american jobs creation act of fsp 
fsp allows companies evaluating the repatriation provision of the act to apply the sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  provisions as it decides on a plan for reinvestment or repatriation of its unremitted foreign earnings 
this fsp requires certain disclosures for companies that have not completed evaluation of the repatriation provision of the act 
see note for discussion of the effect of adoption of the act and required disclosures 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business 
as part of our financial risk management program  we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes and therefore hold no derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we use derivative financial instruments to dampen the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated results and to achieve our targeted mix of fixed and floating interest rates on outstanding debt 
our objective in managing foreign exchange exposures with derivative instruments is to reduce both earnings and cash flow volatility  allowing us to focus our attention on business operations 
with respect to interest rate management  these derivative instruments allow us to achieve our targeted fixed to floating interest rate mix as a separate decision from funding arrangements in the bank and public debt markets 
we measure hedge effectiveness by assessing the changes in the fair value or expected future cash flows of the hedged item 
the ineffective portions are recorded in other income  net in the current period 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we are exposed to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance of derivative contracts and  in the event of nonperformance  to market risk for changes in interest and currency rates  as well as settlement risk 
we manage exposure to counterparty credit risk through credit standards  diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
the following provides additional information on our use of derivative instruments 
included below is a sensitivity analysis that is based upon a hypothetical percent weakening or strengthening in the us dollar compared to the june  foreign currency rates and the effective interest rates under our current borrowing arrangements 
we compared the contractual derivative and borrowing 
table of contents arrangements in effect at june  to the hypothetical foreign exchange or interest rates in the sensitivity analysis to determine the effect on interest expense  pretax income or the accumulated other comprehensive loss 
our analysis takes into consideration the different types of derivative instruments and the applicability of hedge accounting 
cash flow hedges currency a portion of our operations consists of investments in foreign subsidiaries 
our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates arises from these investments  intercompany loans utilized to finance these subsidiaries  trade receivables and payables  and firm commitments arising from international transactions 
we manage our foreign exchange transaction risk to reduce the volatility of cash flows caused by currency fluctuations through natural offsets where appropriate and through foreign exchange contracts 
these contracts are designated as hedges of transactions that will settle in future periods and otherwise would expose us to foreign currency risk 
our foreign exchange hedging program minimizes our exposure to foreign exchange rate movements 
this exposure arises largely from anticipated cash flows from cross border intercompany sales of products and services 
this program utilizes purchased options  range forwards and forward contracts primarily to sell foreign currency 
the notional amounts of the contracts translated into us dollars at june  and rates are million and million  respectively 
we would have received million and million at june  and  respectively  to settle these contracts  which represents the fair value of these agreements 
at june   a hypothetical percent strengthening or weakening of the us dollar would change accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  by million 
in addition  we may enter into forward contracts to hedge transaction exposures or significant cross border intercompany loans by either purchasing or selling specified amounts of foreign currency at a specified date 
at june  and  we had several outstanding forward contracts to purchase and sell foreign currency  with notional amounts  translated into us dollars at june  and rates  of million and million  respectively 
at june   a hypothetical percent change in the year end exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in pretax income of million related to these positions 
interest rate our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt obligations 
we seek to manage our interest rate risk in order to balance our exposure between fixed and floating rates while attempting to minimize our borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to these borrowings 
at june  and  we had interest rate swap agreements outstanding that effectively convert notional amounts of million of debt from floating to fixed interest rates 
the outstanding agreements mature in june of we would have paid million and received million at june  and  respectively  to settle these interest rate swap agreements  which represents the fair value of these agreements 
fair value hedges interest rate as discussed above  our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt obligations 
we seek to manage this risk through the use of interest rate swap agreements 
at june  and  we had interest rate swap agreements outstanding that effectively convert a notional amount of million of the senior unsecured notes from fixed to floating interest rates 
these agreements mature in june but provide for a one time optional early termination for the bank counterparty in june at the then prevailing market value of the swap agreements 
debt and notes payable at june  and  we had million and million  respectively  of debt and notes payable outstanding 
effective interest rates as of june  and were percent and percent  respectively  including the effect of interest rate swaps 
a hypothetical change of percent in interest rates from june  levels would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately million
