the working capital facility and the senior secured notes  impose certain restrictions on our ability to pay distributions to unitholders 
on october   we announced that we would not pay a distribution on the common units 
we had previously announced the suspension of distributions on the senior subordinated units on july  we did not pay a distribution on any outstanding units in fiscal it is unlikely that regular distributions on the common units or senior subordinated units will be resumed in the foreseeable future 
while we hope to position ourselves to pay some regular distribution on the common units in future years  of which there can be no assurance  it is considerably less likely that regular distributions will ever resume on the senior subordinated units because of their subordination terms

overview in analyzing our financial results  the following matters should be considered 
the following is a discussion of the historical condition and results of operations of the partnership and its subsidiaries  and should be read in conjunction with the historical financial and operating data and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
we completed the sale of our tg e segment in march and propane segment in december the following discussion reflects the historical results for the tg e segment and propane segment as discontinued operations 
our fiscal year ends on september all references to quarters and years respectively in this document are to fiscal quarters and years unless otherwise noted 
the seasonal nature of our business results in the sale of approximately of our volume of home heating oil in the first fiscal quarter october through december and of our volume in the second fiscal quarter january through march of each year  the peak heating season  because heating oil is primarily used for space heating in residential and commercial buildings 
we generally realize net income in both of these quarters and net losses during the quarters ending june and september 
in addition  sales volume typically fluctuates from year to year in response to variations in weather  wholesale energy prices and other factors 
gross profit is not only affected by weather patterns but also by changes in customer mix 
for example  sales to our residential variable customers ordinarily generate higher margins than sales to our other customer groups  such as residential protected or commercial customers 
in addition  our gross profit margins vary by geographic region 
accordingly  gross profit margins could vary significantly from year to year in a period of identical sales volumes 

table of contents summary of significant events and developments sale of propane segment new credit facility unitholder suit goodwill write down mlp notes departure of chairman and ceo home heating oil price volatility customer attrition operating expense control recapitalization sale of propane segment in december we completed the sale of our propane segment to inergy for a cash purchase price of million and recognized a gain of approximately million from the sale after closing costs of approximately million 
million of the proceeds from the sale were used to repurchase senior secured notes and first mortgage notes of the heating oil segment and propane segment  together with associated prepayment premiums  accrued interest and the amounts then outstanding under the propane segment s working capital facility 
our propane segment represented approximately and of our total revenue in fiscal and  respectively  and of our operating income in each of fiscal and the historical results of the propane segment are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
new credit facility on december  we executed a new million revolving credit facility with a group of lenders led by jp morgan chase bank  jp this new facility provides us the ability to borrow up to million for working capital purposes subject to certain borrowing base limitations and coverage ratios and replaced the heating oil segment s existing million credit facility 
fees and expenses totaling approximately million were incurred in connection with consummating the new facility 
on november   the revolving credit facility was amended to increase the facility size by million to million for the peak winter months from december through march of each year 
obligations under the new revolving credit facility are secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of the partnership  the heating oil segment and its subsidiaries 
unitholder suit in october  a purported class action lawsuit was filed against the partnership and various subsidiaries and current and former officers and directors 
subsequently  additional class action complaints alleging the same or substantially similar claims were filed in the same district court 
the complaints generally allege that the partnership violated sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the court has consolidated the class action complaints and appointed a lead plaintiff 
on september  we filed motions to dismiss 
plaintiffs replied to these motions on november  and we expect to file our reply briefs on or about december  in the interim  discovery in the matter remains stayed 
we intend to continue to defend against this purported class action lawsuit vigorously 
goodwill write down during the second quarter of fiscal we incurred a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million at the heating oil segment as a result of triggering events that occurred during the second quarter of these triggering events included a significant decline in our unit price and the determination that operating results for fiscal would be significantly lower than previously expected 
mlp notes in accordance with the terms of the indenture relating to the partnership s senior notes mlp notes  we are permitted within days of the sale  to apply the net proceeds the net proceeds of the sale of the propane segment either to reduce indebtedness and reduce any related commitment of the partnership or of a restricted subsidiary  or to make an investment in assets or capital expenditures useful to the business of the partnership or any of its subsidiaries as in effect on the issue date of the mlp notes the issue date or any business related  ancillary or complementary to any of the businesses of the partnership on the issue date each a permitted use and collectively the permitted uses 
to the extent any net proceeds that are not so applied exceed million excess proceeds  the indenture requires us to make an offer to all holders of mlp notes to purchase for cash that number of mlp notes that may be purchased with excess proceeds at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the mlp notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase 
at september   the amount of net proceeds in excess of million not yet applied toward a permitted use totaled million 
as of december  all excess proceeds were applied toward a permitted use 
we understand  based on informal communications  that certain holders of mlp notes may take the position that the use of net proceeds to invest in working capital assets is not a permitted use under the indenture 
we disagree with this position and have communicated our disagreement with these noteholders 
however  if our position is challenged and we are unsuccessful in defending our position  this 
table of contents would constitute an event of default under the indenture if declared either by the holders of in principal amount of the senior notes or by the trustee 
in such event  all amounts due under the senior notes would become immediately due and payable  which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern 
the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our consolidated financial statements as of september  and  and for the three years ended september   includes an explanatory paragraph with respect to the impact of this matter on our ability to continue as a going concern if this matter is resolved adversely to us 
we have reached an agreement with the holders of in aggregate principal amount of the senior notes to resolve this matter  which is subject to our completing the proposed recapitalization  of which there can be no assurance 
see recapitalization below

home heating oil price volatility the wholesale price of heating oil  like any other market commodity  is generally set by the economic forces of supply and demand 
rapid global expansion is fueling an ever increasing demand for oil 
home heating oil prices are closely linked to the price refiners pay for crude oil because crude oil is the principal cost component of home heating oil 
crude oil is bought and sold in the international marketplace and as such is subject to the economic forces of supply and demand worldwide 
the united states imports more than of the petroleum products it consumes 
the wholesale cost of home heating oil as measured by the new york mercantile exchange nymex at september   and was  and  respectively the current marketplace for petroleum products including home heating oil has been extremely volatile 
in a volatile market even small changes in supply or demand can dramatically affect prices 
the changes we have seen this past year and continue to experience have been significant 
heating oil prices are subject to price fluctuations if demand rises sharply because of excessively cold weather and or disruptions at refineries and instability in key oil producing regions 
ultimately  increases in wholesale prices are  in most instances  borne by our customers 
because of these high prices we have experienced increased attrition in our customer base and a decrease in heating oil volume sold per customer conservation 
for fiscal  over of our revenue is attributable to the retail sale and delivery of home heating oil 
about half of our retail sales of home heating oil are to customers who agree to pay a fixed or maximum price per gallon for each delivery over the next twelve months protected price customers 
the remaining retail sales are to customers that pay a variable price based principally on the daily spot price plus our profit margin 
we mitigate our exposure to our price protected customers in a volatile market by hedging our fixed and maximum price sales through the purchase of exchange traded options and futures  and over the counter options and swaps  and we mitigate our exposure to variable priced customers  in most instances  by passing through higher home heating oil costs directly to such customers 
customer attrition net customer attrition is the difference between gross customer losses and customers added through marketing efforts 
customers added through acquisitions are not included in the calculation of net customer attrition 
the gain of a new customer does not fully compensate for the loss of an existing customer during the first year because of the expenses that must be incurred to acquire a new customer and the higher attrition rate associated with new customers 
gross customer losses are the result of a number of factors  including price competition  move outs  and service issues 
when a customer moves out of an existing home we count the move out as a loss and if we are successful in signing up the new homeowner  the move in is treated as a gain 
gross customer gains and gross customer losses for fiscal  and is found below fiscal year ended description gross customer gains gross customer losses net customer loss net customer attrition as a percent of the home heating oil customer base for fiscal   and is found below fiscal year ended description gross customer gains gross customer losses net customer attrition 
table of contents net home heating oil customers accounts added lost for fiscal   and by quarter is as follows quarter ended fiscal fiscal fiscal december march june september total we experienced net customer attrition of in fiscal this compares to net attrition of and in fiscal and  respectively 
this increase in net customer attrition for both fiscal and can be attributed to i a combination of the effect of our premium service premium price strategy during a volatile period when customer price sensitivity increased due to high energy prices  ii our decision in fiscal to maintain reasonable profit margins going forward in spite of competitors aggressive pricing tactics  iii the lag effect of customer attrition related to service and delivery problems experienced in prior fiscal years  iv continued customer dissatisfaction with the centralization of customer care  and v tightened customer credit standards 
if wholesale prices remain high  we believe the risk of customer losses due to credit problems  especially for commercial customers  may increase and bad debt expense will also increase 
we have continued to experience net customer attrition during fiscal for the period from october to november  we lost  accounts net or of our home heating oil customer base as compared to the period from october to november  in which we gained accounts net or of our customer base 
for fiscal  we lost approximately  accounts net or  more than the  accounts net lost in fiscal this increased loss of  accounts is largely due to the factors described above as well as losses of fixed price accounts that were renewed at a low fixed price in the summer and fall of  as the heating oil segment  in an attempt to retain customers  did not raise prices sufficiently to offset the increase in the cost of home heating oil and which chose not to renew at higher prices in fiscal during the three months ended september   we lost  accounts net or of our home heating oil customer base  as compared to the three months ended september  in which we lost  accounts net or of its home heating oil customer base 
this increased loss of  accounts is largely due to losses attributable to accounts that were renewed at a low fixed price in the summer and fall of and who chose not to renew at higher prices in fiscal we cannot predict whether this trend will continue 
over the past several months  we have modified our marketing plan and are seeking to increase the home heating oil product margins realized on new accounts as well as some of our less profitable accounts 
we anticipate that while this program could improve net income and lower marketing expenses  fewer new accounts will likely be added which will result in higher net customer attrition in the near term 
prior to the fiscal winter heating season  we attempted to develop a competitive advantage in customer service through a business process redesign project and  as part of that effort  centralized our heating equipment service and oil dispatch functions and engaged a centralized customer care center to fulfill our telephone requirements for a majority of our home heating oil customers 
we experienced difficulties in advancing this initiative during fiscal  which adversely impacted the customer base and our costs 
the savings from this initiative were less than expected and the costs to operate under the centralized format were greater than originally estimated 
the net customer attrition rate in fiscal was higher than the rate experienced in fiscal and higher than in the preceding several years 
for fiscal  before the full implementation of the business process and redesign project and before the increase in the wholesale price of home heating oil  we experienced annual net customer attrition of 
we believe we have identified the problems associated with our centralization efforts and have addressed these issues by structuring the customer call center that we sometimes refer to in this annual report as the customer care center into work groups that parallel petro s district structure  adding customer retention specialists at the district level  answering a portion of customer calls in two districts  providing continuous in house training at the customer care center  and establishing a general manager of customer retention 
the general manager of customer retention reports directly to the president 
despite these efforts  we continued to experience high net attrition rates in  and we expect that high net attrition rates may continue through fiscal and perhaps beyond 
even to the extent that the rate of attrition may be halted  the current reduced customer base will adversely impact net income in the future 

table of contents the quantitative factors we use to measure the effectiveness of the customer care center and field operations such as customer satisfaction scores  telephone waiting times and abandonment rates at the customer care center  oil delivery run outs and heating equipment repair and maintenance response times have improved meaningfully during fiscal  as compared to the same periods in fiscal and fiscal operating expense control we have implemented a series of cost reduction initiatives in fiscal including facility consolidations  the reduction of non essential personnel and the reduction and re evaluation of certain marketing programs 
we believe this will be an ongoing process over the next several months as we continue to review our operating expenses 
we believe that operating expenses have been reduced by approximately million at the heating oil segment and by approximately million at the partners level 
a portion of these expense reductions were realized during fiscal and the remainder are expected to be realized in fiscal in addition  a wage freeze has been implemented for senior management in fiscal we renewed our officers and directors insurance for the policy year beginning april the annual premium is million and represents an increase of million over the prior year s policy 
recapitalization on december  the board of directors of star gas llc approved a strategic recapitalization of star gas partners that  if approved by unitholders and completed  would result in a reduction in the outstanding amount of our senior notes due senior notes  of between approximately million and million 
the recapitalization includes a commitment by kestrel energy partners  llc or kestrel and its affiliates to purchase million of new equity capital and provide a standby commitment in a million rights offering to our common unitholders  at a price of per common unit 
we would utilize the million in new equity financing  together with an additional million to million from operations  to repurchase at least million in face amount of our senior notes and  at our option  up to approximately million of senior notes 
in addition  certain noteholders have agreed to convert approximately million in face amount of senior notes into newly issued common units at a conversion price of per unit in connection with the closing of the recapitalization 
we have entered into agreements with the holders of approximately in principal amount of our senior notes which provide that the noteholders commit to  and will  tender their senior notes at par i for a pro rata portion of million or  at our option  up to approximately million in cash  ii in exchange for approximately  new common units at a conversion price of per unit which new units would be acquired by exchanging approximately million in face amount of senior notes and iii in exchange for new notes representing the remaining face amount of the tendered notes 
the principle terms of the new senior notes  such as the term and interest rate are the same as the senior notes 
the closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon the closing of the transactions under the kestrel unit purchase agreement  which is discussed below 
upon closing the transaction we will incur a gain or loss on the exchange of senior notes for common units based on the difference between the per unit conversion price and the fair value per unit represented by the per unit price in the open market on the conversion date 
subject to and until the transaction closing  the noteholders have agreed not to accelerate indebtedness due under the senior notes or initiate any litigation or proceeding with respect to the senior notes 
the noteholders have further agreed to waive any default under the indenture  not to tender the senior notes in the change of control offer which will be required to be made following the closing of the transactions under the unit purchase agreement with kestrel  and to consent to certain amendments to the existing indenture 
the agreement with the noteholders further provides for the termination of its provisions in the event that the kestrel unit purchase agreement is no longer in effect 
the understandings and agreements contemplated by these transactions will terminate if the transaction does not close prior to april  we believe the proposed recapitalization would substantially strengthen our balance sheet and thereby assist us in meeting our liquidity and capital requirements  which we believe would improve our future financial performance and as a result enhance unitholder value 
in addition to enhancing unitholder value  we believe we will be able to operate more efficiently going forward with less long term debt 
as part of the recapitalization transaction  we have entered into a definitive unit purchase agreement with kestrel and its affiliates  which provides for  among other things the receipt by us of million in new equity financing through the issuance to kestrel s affiliates of  common units at per unit for an aggregate of million and the issuance of an additional  common units in a rights offering to our common unitholders at an exercise price of per unit for an aggregate of million 
the rights will be non transferable  and an affiliate of kestrel has agreed to buy any common units not subscribed for in the rights offering 
under the terms of the unit purchase agreement  kestrel heat  llc  or kestrel heat  a wholly owned subsidiary of kestrel  will become our new general partner and star gas llc  our current general partner  will receive no consideration for its removal as general partner 

table of contents in addition  the unit purchase agreement provides for the adoption of a second amended and restated agreement of limited partnership that will  among other matters provide for the mandatory conversion of each outstanding senior subordinated unit and junior subordinated unit into one common unit  change the minimum quarterly distribution to the common units from per quarter  or per year  to per unit  or per year  which shall commence accruing october   and  eliminate all previously accrued cumulative distribution arrearages which aggregated million at november   suspend all distributions of available cash by us through the fiscal quarter ending september   reallocate the incentive distribution rights so that  commencing october   the new general partner units in the aggregate will be entitled to receive of the available cash distributed once 
per quarter  or per year  has been distributed to common units and general partner units and of the available cash distributed in excess of per quarter  or 
per year  provided there are no arrearages in minimum quarterly distributions at the time of such distribution under our current partnership agreement if quarterly distributions of available cash exceed certain target levels  the senior subordinated units  junior subordinated units and general partner units would receive an increased percentage of distributions  resulting in their receiving a greater amount on a per unit basis than the common units 
the recapitalization is subject to certain closing conditions including  the approval of our unitholders  approval of the lenders under our revolving credit facility  and the successful completion of the tender offer for our senior notes 
as a result of the challenging financial and operating conditions that we have experienced since fiscal  we have not been able to generate sufficient available cash from operations to pay the minimum quarterly distribution of per unit on our partnership securities 
these conditions led to the suspension of distributions on our senior subordinated units  junior subordinated units and general partner units on july  and to the suspension of distributions on the common units on october  we believe that the proposed amendments to our partnership agreement will simplify our capital structure  provide internally generated funds for future investment and align the minimum quarterly distribution more closely with the levels of available cash from operations that we expect to generate in the future

business outlook fiscal we expect our business to continue to be affected by the following key trends 
our expectations are based on assumptions made by us  and information currently available to us 
to the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect  our actual results may vary materially from our estimated results 
we face numerous challenges in fiscal in particular  it will be difficult to stem the high attrition rates and continued customer conservation that we are currently experiencing  primarily as a result of a volatile and consistently high heating oil commodity market 

table of contents based on our outlook we expect increased global demand for oil and gas in fiscal  particularly as a result of emerging energy consumers such as china and india 
this resultant increase in demand may support relatively high heating oil commodity prices 
we believe that our efforts to decentralize a portion of our current service operations by redirecting a portion of our customer calls and empowering our local branches will provide benefits in stemming attrition rates in in addition  we believe our cost control programs coupled with our increasing discipline in hedging rising commodity price risk for our customer price protected contracts and continued philosophy of maintaining reasonable margins in spite of competitors aggressive price tactics should mitigate some of the negative impact associated with the continued high heating oil prices in fiscal as a result we anticipate that our per gallon margin may improve over our margins earned in fiscal we believe the proposed recapitalization  as described above  if approved by our unitholders and completed  will substantially strengthen our balance sheet and thereby assist us in meeting our liquidity and capital requirements  which we believe will improve our future financial performance and as a result enhance unitholder value 
in addition to enhancing unitholder value  we believe we will be able to operate more efficiently going forward with less long term debt 
in the latter part of fiscal  we intend to pursue asset acquisitions  to the extent permitted in our credit facility  in demographic areas that will enable us to realize margins we consider reasonable in the face of aggressive localized price competition as one way to replace volume lost through attrition 
in addition  we may dispose of operations in markets where we are not able to effectively employ our strategy of maintaining reasonable margins 
we anticipate using this cash flow  in part  to the extent permitted under our credit facility and mlp notes  to fund anticipated acquisitions

total degree days in the heating oil segment s geographic areas of operations were approximately greater in fiscal than in fiscal and approximately greater than normal  as reported by the national oceanic atmospheric administration noaa 
due to the significant increase in the price per gallon of home heating oil during the year  we believe that customers are using less home heating oil given similar temperatures 
indications based on internal studies suggest that our customers have reduced their consumption by approximately 
we cannot determine if conservation is a permanent or temporary phenomenon 
in addition  we estimate that 
table of contents during fiscal  home heating oil volume was reduced by million gallons due to a delivery scheduling variance 
we believe that home heating oil volume sold in fiscal may be substantially less than in fiscal due to customer attrition  conservation and other factors such as warmer temperatures 
product sales for fiscal  product sales increased million  or  to billion  as compared to million for fiscal  as increases in selling prices more than offset a decline in product sales due to lower volume sold 
selling prices during fiscal were higher due to the increase in wholesale supply costs 
average wholesale supply costs were per gallon for fiscal  as compared to per gallon for fiscal the weighted average selling price per gallon was per gallon in fiscal compared to in fiscal installation  service and other sales for fiscal  installation  service and other sales increased million  or  to million compared to million in fiscal  as a decline in installation and other sales of million was offset by an increase in service revenues of million 
over the last several years  the heating oil segment has taken proactive measures  such as modifying service plans and billing strategies  in order to maximize service revenue 
cost of product for fiscal  cost of product increased million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal this is the result of an increase in the heating oil segment s average wholesale product cost of per gallon  or  to an average of per gallon for fiscal  from an average of per gallon for fiscal in an effort to reduce net customer attrition  we delayed increasing our selling price to certain customers whose price plan agreements expired during the july to september time period 
this decision negatively impacted gross profit by an estimated million in fiscal  primarily during the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  product cost was adversely impacted by million due to a delay in hedging the price of product for certain residential protected price customers due to cash constraints under our previous credit agreement 
cost of product was also adversely impacted by million associated with not hedging the price of product for certain residential price protected customers that were incorrectly coded as variable customers 
this coding error was corrected in december home heating oil per gallon margins for the year ended september  declined by cents per gallon  compared to fiscal due to an increase in the percentage of volume sold to lower margin residential price protected customers  the delay in increasing the selling price to customers whose price plans expired during the july to september time period and the aforementioned hedging issues concerning price protected customers 
gross profit from product sales decreased million in fiscal due to the margins associated with lower sales volume and million due to lower per gallon margins which includes million delay in price increases previously described for the volume sold in fiscal compared to fiscal our customer base is comprised of three types of customers  residential variable  residential protected price and commercial industrial 
the selling price for a residential variable customer generally has the highest per gallon gross profit margin 
in an effort to retain existing customers and attract new customers  we have offered and currently are offering discounts that negatively impact the average per gallon gross profit margins 
currently  these discounts are being offered to residential variable and price protected customers 
over time  we will try to reduce these discounts and increase the per gallon gross profit margin 
if we are not successful in reducing these discounts  per gallon gross profit margins may further decline 
due to the greater price sensitivity of residential protected price customers  the per gallon margins realized from that customer segment generally are less than variable priced residential customers 
commercial industrial customers are characterized as large volume users and contribute the lowest per gallon margin 
the percentage of home heating oil volume sold to residential protected price customers increased to approximately of total home heating oil volume sales during fiscal  as compared to for fiscal accordingly  the percentage of home heating oil volume sold to residential variable customers decreased to approximately for fiscal  as compared to for fiscal during fiscal  sales to commercial industrial customers represented approximately of total home heating oil volume sales  unchanged from fiscal rising energy costs have increased consumer interest in price protection 
if wholesale supply costs remain volatile and or at historically high levels  per gallon profit margins and results could continue to be adversely impacted 
cost of installations and service for fiscal  cost of installations and service decreased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this reduction was due to a lower level of variable installation costs of million attributable to the lower level of installation sales and a million decline in service expenses 
service expenses decreased due to a contraction in costs resulting from servicing a smaller customer base  warmer temperatures during the peak heating season  which reduced the frequency of service calls  and an improvement in the scheduling of preventative maintenance service calls which lowered overtime hours 
the loss realized from service including installations improved by million from a million loss for fiscal to a million loss for fiscal when measured on a per gallon of home heating oil sold basis  the loss from service improved by cents per gallon from cents per gallon for fiscal to cents for fiscal 
table of contents delivery and branch expenses for fiscal  delivery and branch expenses decreased million or to million compared to million of expenses incurred in fiscal bad debt expense  credit card processing fees and collection expenses all increased  primarily due to the increase in product sales dollars 
delivery costs were also higher due to the rise in vehicle fuel costs 
in total  delivery and branch expenses increased by million due to the increase in bad debt expense  credit card processing fees  collection expenses  and fuel costs 
delivery and branch expenses also increased by approximately million due to wage and benefit increases 
these delivery and branch expense increases were offset by a reduction in operating costs due to the variable nature of certain delivery and operating expenses such as direct delivery expense  which decreased with lower volume 
on a cents per gallon basis  operating costs increased cents per gallon  or  from cents per gallon for fiscal to cents per gallon for fiscal the cent per gallon increase was due to higher bad debt and collection expenses  wage and benefit increases  and the inability to reduce certain fixed expenses commensurate with a reduction in home heating oil volume of 
depreciation and amortization for fiscal  depreciation and amortization expenses declined by million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal as certain assets  which were not replaced  became fully depreciated 
general and administrative expenses during fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal at the partners level  general and administrative expenses increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to million in bridge financing fees  million of legal expenses incurred relating to defending several purported class action lawsuits  legal and professional fees associated with exploring several refinancing alternatives  legal expense attributable to inquiries from regulatory agencies  an increase in officers and directors insurance of million  million in expenses for compliance with sarbanes oxley  million in expense relating to separation agreements entered into with the former chief executive officer  chief financial officer  and chief marketing officer of the partnership  and million higher compensation expense associated with unit appreciation rights 
in fiscal and fiscal  the decline in the unit price for senior subordinated units resulted in reversing previously recorded expenses of million and million  respectively 
the separation agreement with irik sevin  the former ceo million  was fully accrued during fiscal and will be paid over an extended period of time 
at the heating oil segment  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal  compared to million for fiscal this increase was due primarily to million of expenses and fees associated with certain bank amendments and waivers on our previous credit facility obtained during the first fiscal quarter of  offset in part by lower business process improvement expenses of million and a reduction in compensation and benefit expense of million 
goodwill impairment charge during the second quarter of fiscal  a number of events occurred that indicated a possible impairment of goodwill might exist 
these events included our determination in february of significantly lower than expected operating results for fiscal and a significant decline in the partnership s unit price 
as a result of these triggering events and circumstances  we completed an interim sfas no 
impairment review with the assistance of a third party valuation firm as of february  this review resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately million  which reduced the carrying amount of goodwill of the heating oil segment 
operating income loss for fiscal  operating income decreased million to a loss of million  compared to million in operating income for fiscal the decrease in our operating income in fiscal is the result of a million non cash goodwill impairment charge  as described above  lower margin from the sale of petroleum products of million  increases in general and administrative expense totaling million offset in part by an increase in service profitability of million  decreases in branch and delivery expenses of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
interest expense during fiscal  interest expense decreased million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal this change was due to the impact of lower average debt outstanding offset by an increase in our weighted average interest rate during fiscal total debt outstanding declined because a portion of the proceeds from the propane sale  were used in part to repay debt at the heating oil segment 
average working capital borrowings were higher in fiscal due principally to the increase in wholesale product cost 

table of contents interest income during fiscal  interest income increased by million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal due principally to higher average invested cash balances 
amortization of debt issuance costs for fiscal  amortization of debt issuance costs decreased million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal loss on redemption of debt during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a loss of million on the early redemption of certain notes at the heating oil and propane segments 
the loss consisted of cash premiums paid of million for early redemption  the write off of previously capitalized net deferred financing costs of million and legal expenses of million  reduced in part by the realization of the unamortized portion of a million basis adjustment to the carrying value of long term debt 
income tax expense benefit income tax expense for fiscal was approximately million compared to million in fiscal the decrease of approximately million is the result of increases in state capital taxes of million in fiscal which is more than offset by million in tax benefits that were fully utilized against taxes associated with the gain on the sale of the propane segment 
income loss from continuing operations for fiscal the loss from continuing operations increased million to a loss of million  compared to a loss of million for fiscal  as the decline in operating income of million and the loss on the redemption of debt of million were reduced by lower interest expense of million  higher interest income of million  lower amortization of debt issuance costs of million and a decrease in income tax expense of million 
income loss from discontinued operations for fiscal  income from discontinued operations decreased million 
income from the discontinued propane segment  which was sold on december   generated million in net income for fiscal and a net loss of million for fiscal the discontinued tg e segment was sold on march  and generated net income of million for fiscal gain on sales of discontinued operations during fiscal  the purchase price for the tg e segment was finalized and a positive adjustment of million was recorded 
in addition  during fiscal  we recorded a gain on the sale of the propane segment totaling approximately million  which is net of income taxes of million 
net loss for fiscal  the net loss increased million to a net loss of million  compared to a net loss of million incurred in fiscal  as the decline in operating income loss from continuing operations of million  and the reduction in income from discontinued operations of million was partially offset by the gain on the sale of the propane segment and tg e segment of million 

table of contents earnings from continuing operations before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for fiscal  ebitda decreased million to an ebidta loss of million  as compared to million in ebitda for fiscal this decrease was due to a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  the recording of a million loss on the redemption of debt  a reduction in gross profit of million due to lower sales volume resulting from net customer attrition  conservation and lower gross profit margins from product sales  bridge facility fees  bank amendment fees  and legal fees totaling million  million in compensation expense relating to severance agreements with former executives  and million for compliance with sarbanes oxley  offset in part by a million increase in service profitability and lower branch expenses and business process improvement costs 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations  but provides additional information for evaluating our ability to make the minimum quarterly distribution

net income loss the partnership completed the sale of its tg e segment during march and its propane segment as of november see note volume for fiscal  retail volume of home heating oil decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons  as compared to million gallons for fiscal an analysis of the change in retail volume of home heating oil  which is based on management s estimates  sampling  and other mathematical calculations as actual customer consumption patterns cannot be precisely determined is found below 
in millions of gallons heating oil segment volume fiscal impact of warmer temperatures impact of acquisitions net customer attrition other change volume fiscal we believe that this million gallon decline at the heating oil segment was due to the impact of warmer temperatures and net customer attrition partially offset by acquisitions and other volume changes 
net customer attrition is the difference between gross customer losses and customers added through internal marketing efforts 
customers added through acquisitions do not impact the calculation of net attrition 
temperatures in the heating oil segment s geographic areas of operations were warmer in fiscal than in fiscal and approximately warmer than normal as reported by the noaa 

table of contents at september   after adjusting for acquisitions  the heating oil segment estimated that it had approximately fewer home heating oil customers than as of september  for the quarter ended september   the heating oil segment excluding acquisitions lost approximately  customers net as compared to the quarter ended september   in which the heating oil segment lost approximately customers net 
we believe that net customer attrition is the result of various factors including but not limited to price  service and credit 
the continued rise in the price of heating oil  especially during the fourth quarter of fiscal  added to the heating oil segment s difficulties in reducing customer attrition 
we believe that the unprecedented rise in heating oil prices has increased the competitive pressures facing our heating oil segment 
as wholesale prices have risen  many of our competitors have not raised their retail prices to fully offset the wholesale price rise 
in an effort to minimize the loss of customers to price competition  we did not increase our prices to fully offset for the rise in wholesale prices  resulting in reduced margins 
nevertheless  many of our competitors appear to have succeeded in inducing some of our customers to leave through various price related strategies 
in addition  prior to the winter heating season  we attempted to develop a competitive advantage in customer service and  as part of that effort  we experienced difficulties in centralizing our heating equipment service dispatch and engaged a centralized customer care center to respond to telephone inquiries 
the implementation of that initiative has taken longer than we anticipated  impacting customer service 
we believe that the rate of customer loss in fiscal was due to a combination of higher energy prices  operational and customer service problems together with the implementation of stricter customer credit requirements towards the end of fiscal product sales for fiscal  product sales declined by million  or  to million  as compared to million in fiscal while warmer temperatures and customer losses at the heating oil segment led to a reduction in product sales  the decline was partially offset by an increase in product sales attributable to acquisitions and higher selling prices 
sales  installations and service for fiscal  installation  service and appliance sales increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal due to acquisitions and measures taken in the last several years to increase service revenues 
cost of product for fiscal  cost of product declined by million  or  to million  as compared to million in fiscal  as the impact of net customer attrition and warmer temperatures exceeded wholesale cost increases and the additional product requirement for acquisitions 
while selling prices and wholesale prices increased on a per gallon basis  the increase in selling prices exceeded the increase in supply costs during the first nine months of fiscal at september   heating oil supply costs were approximately higher than at june  during the three months ended september   we were not able to fully pass these increases on to our respective customers 
as a result  per gallon margins for the three months ended september  declined by cents per gallon at the heating oil segment  as compared to the three months ended september   which partially offset per gallon margin increases that the heating oil segment experienced earlier in the year 
the per gallon margins realized in the heating oil segment for the three months ended september  were significantly less than expected 
for fiscal  per gallon margin increases were realized in the base business compared to fiscal excluding the impact of acquisitions of cents per gallon 
cost of installations  service and appliances for fiscal  cost of installations  service and appliances increased million  or  to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal this change was primarily due to acquisitions and wage and other cost increases 
delivery and branch expenses for fiscal  delivery and branch expenses increased million  or  to million  as compared to million in fiscal this increase of million was due to a higher level of fixed and variable operating costs attributable to acquisitions  primarily those completed in eastern pennsylvania of million and approximately million due to operating and wage increases 
these increases in delivery and branch expenses were partially reduced by cost reductions relating to lower volume delivered due to warmer temperatures and net customer attrition experienced in fiscal prior to the winter heating season  we attempted to develop a competitive advantage in customer service  and as part of that effort centralized our heating equipment service dispatch functions and engaged a centralized call center to respond to telephone inquiries 
start up challenges associated with this initiative impacted the customer base and unanticipated training and support was required 
the expected savings from this initiative were less than expected 

table of contents depreciation and amortization for fiscal  depreciation and amortization expenses increased approximately million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to a larger depreciable base of assets  as a result of the impact of acquisitions in fiscal and to increased depreciation resulting from the technology investment made by the heating oil segment in centralizing its customer service and dispatcher functions 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal  general and administrative expenses declined approximately million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal at the partners level  general and administrative expenses declined by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to a million reduction in the expense for compensation earned for unit appreciation rights on the partnership s senior subordinated units  a million reduction in restricted stock awards and a reduction of million in bonus compensation expense 
for fiscal  partners expenses totaled million  which included million in salary expense and bonus  million in legal and administrative costs  partially offset by a credit of million for unit appreciation rights 
for fiscal  partners expenses totaled million  which included million in salary and bonus expense  million in unit appreciation rights and restricted stock awards expense and million in legal and administrative costs 
at the heating oil segment  general and administrative expenses declined by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decline was due to a reduction in certain expenses relating to the heating oil segment s centralized customer service and dispatch project of million 
the reduction in general and administrative expenses at the heating oil segment was partially offset by million in additional expenses due to severance paid and a higher level of legal and professional expenses 
operating income loss for fiscal  operating income decreased approximately million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal at the partners level  the operating loss decreased by million from a million loss in fiscal to a million loss in fiscal due to a million reduction in the accrual for compensation earned for unit appreciation rights on the partnership s senior subordinated units  lower restricted stock awards of million and lower bonus compensation expense of million 
at the heating oil segment  operating income declined by million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this decline was due to warmer temperatures of in the heating oil segment s geographic areas of operations in fiscal than in fiscal  net customer attrition  operating and wage increases and higher depreciation and amortization expense  which were reduced in part by the operating income attributable to acquisitions  an increase in per gallon gross profit margins of the base business  lower expenses associated with the heating oil segment s centralized customer service and dispatch project and increased service revenues 
interest expense for fiscal  interest expense increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was due to higher principal amount of long term debt outstanding and an increase in the weighted average interest rate during fiscal  as compared to fiscal amortization of debt issuance costs for fiscal  amortization of debt issuance costs increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was largely due to the amortization of debt issuance costs for the partnership s million senior notes offerings and for the amortization of bank fees incurred in connection with refinancing certain bank facilities 
income tax expense income tax expense for fiscal was million and represents certain state income taxes 
the amount recorded in fiscal was unchanged from fiscal income loss from continuing operations for fiscal  income loss from continuing operations decreased million  to a loss of million  as compared to a loss of million for fiscal this decline was due to a million decrease in income at the heating oil segment offset by million in lower losses at the partners level 
income loss from continuing operations declined as the effects of warmer temperatures  other volume changes  including customer losses  operating and wage increases and an increase in interest expense were partially offset by the positive impacts of acquisitions  improved per gallon gross profit margins on the base business and lower compensation expenses at the partners level of million in the form of unit appreciation rights  restricted stock awards and bonus expense 

table of contents income from discontinued operations for fiscal  income from discontinued operations increased million from million in to million in this income relates to the operating results of the tg e segment that was sold on march  and the propane segment sold on december  net income attributable to the tg e segment decreased million and net income attributable to the propane segment increased million 
the tg e segment includes operations for six months of the fiscal year ended september  and the propane segment includes operations for the entire fiscal year 
propane segment sales increased approximately million  operating income decreased approximately million  and net income increased approximately million 
the increase in sales is attributable to higher selling prices due to the higher wholesale cost of propane and to a lesser extent an increased customer base resulting from acquisitions 
the decrease in operating income is principally due to higher product costs as a result of the higher wholesale cost of propane 
loss on sale of tg e segment for fiscal  we recorded a million loss on the sale of the tg e segment 
tg e was sold in march cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for fiscal  we recorded a million charge arising from the adoption of statement no 
to reflect the impairment of its goodwill for tg e 
net income loss for fiscal  net income loss decreased million  to a loss of million  as compared to million in income for fiscal the change was due to a million decrease in income from continuing operations  a million increase in income from discontinued operations and the million loss on the sale of tg e 
net income was also impacted by the adoption of sfas no 
 which resulted in a charge of million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our ability to satisfy our obligations will depend on our future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic  financial  business and weather conditions  the ability to pass on the full impact of high wholesale heating oil prices to customers  the effects of high customer attrition  conservation and other factors  most of which are beyond our control 
see risk factors 
capital requirements  at least in the near term  are expected to be provided by cash flows from operating activities  cash on hand at september  or a combination thereof 
to the extent future capital requirements exceed cash flows from operating activities  we anticipate that working capital will be financed by our revolving credit facility as discussed below and repaid from subsequent seasonal reductions in inventory and accounts receivable and the utilization of the excess proceeds from the sale of the propane segment for any purpose permitted by its debt instruments 
we also believe that we will able to reduce our peak inventory levels  which will positively impact our liquidity 
see recapitalization operating activities for fiscal  net cash used in operating activities was million or million less than net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal due to the following factors 
at september   accounts receivable before the allowance for doubtful accounts were million higher than at september  and accounts receivable at september  were million higher than at september  due to higher per gallon selling prices resulting from the continuing increase in the wholesale cost of home heating oil throughout this two year period 
as a result of the change in accounts receivable in fiscal when compared to fiscal  cash flow from operating activities was reduced by million 
higher per gallon wholesale heating oil costs and additional volume on hand resulted in a higher inventory balance as of september  than september  and a higher inventory balance as of september  than september  as a result  cash provided by operating activities was reduced by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal due to the change in inventory 
operating activities were adversely impacted by the loss of trade credit 
prior to october   we were able to purchase a portion of our home heating oil under terms extended by suppliers  which averaged approximately two to three days 
currently  heating oil suppliers are not extending trade credit to the heating oil segment and the heating oil segment must prepay for its supply 
the loss of trade credit reduced cash flow from operating activities by million in the decline in operating income of million described elsewhere in this report which included a non cash impairment charge of million and approximately million in costs associated with legal and professional fees in connection with class action lawsuits  compliance with sarbanes oxley  bank refinancing and bank fees contributed to the decline in cash from operating activities 

table of contents investing activities during fiscal  we completed the sale of the propane segment 
the net proceeds  after deducting expenses  were approximately million 
in addition  we also finalized the sale of tg e and recorded an additional million in proceeds 
during fiscal  the heating oil segment spent million for capital expenditures and received proceeds from the sale of certain assets of million 
as a result  cash flow provided by investing activities was million 
for fiscal  cash flows provided by investing activities were million as the heating oil segment received million from the sale of certain assets  spent million for capital expenditures  completed acquisitions totaling million and received million in cash from the sale of the tg e segment 
financing activities cash flows used in financing activities were million for fiscal during this period  million of cash was provided from borrowings under the heating oil segment s new revolving credit facility million and previous credit facility million  which were used to repay million borrowed under our previous credit facility and million borrowed under our new credit facility 
also during fiscal  we repaid million in long term debt  paid million in debt prepayment premiums and expenses and million in fees and expenses related to refinancing the heating oil segment s new bank credit facilities 
as a result of the above activity and million of cash used by discontinued operations  cash increased by million  to million as of september  
table of contents financing and sources of liquidity we had million of debt outstanding as of september  excluding working capital borrowings of million 
the following summarizes our long term debt maturities occurring over the next five years as of september  in millions thereafter on december   we entered into a million asset based revolving credit facility with a group of lenders led by jp morgan chase bank  which was amended in november the revolving credit facility provides the heating oil segment with the ability to borrow up to million for working capital purposes subject to certain borrowing base limitations and coverage ratios including the issuance of up to million in letters of credit 
from december through march of each year  the heating oil segment can borrow up to million 
obligations under the revolving credit facility are secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of the heating oil segment  including accounts receivable  inventory  general intangibles  real property  fixtures and equipment 
under the terms of the revolving credit facility  we must maintain at all times either availability borrowing base less amounts borrowed and letters of credit issued of million or a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement of not less than to as of september   availability was million and the fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement was to this million represents a reduction in availability 
we do not anticipate maintaining a fixed charge coverage ratio of to or greater in the foreseeable future 
in december  we completed the sale of our propane segment 
pursuant to the terms of the indenture relating to the mlp notes  we are permitted  within days of the sale  to apply the net proceeds to a permitted use 
to the extent there are any excess proceeds  the indenture requires the partnership to make an offer to all holders of mlp notes to purchase for cash that number of mlp notes that may be purchased with excess proceeds at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the mlp notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase 
after repayment of certain debt and transaction expenses and estimated taxes paid of million  the net proceeds from the propane segment sale were approximately million 
as of september   the heating oil segment had utilized million of such net proceeds to invest in working capital assets  purchase capital assets and repay long term debt  which reduced the amount of net proceeds in excess of million not applied toward a permitted use to million as of september  at september   the amount of excess proceeds totaled million 
as of december  all excess proceeds were applied toward a permitted use 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition on results of operations summary of significant events and developments mlp notes 
as of september  total liquidity resources including proceeds from the sale of the propane segment  were million 
total liquidity resources reflect the availability of million  less minimum availability of million  plus cash of million  subject to the requirements of the indenture for the mlp notes 
we expect total liquidity resources to decline through the first and second quarters of fiscal as we fund working capital requirements for the heating oil season 
as we have indicated  we are in the process of evaluating our near term and longer term liquidity position and capital structure 
availability under our revolving credit facility could be significantly impacted by our current hedging strategy 
we enter into various hedging arrangements to manage the majority of our exposure to market risk related to changes in the current and future market price of home heating oil purchased for resale to our protected price customers 
futures contracts are marked to market on a daily basis and require an initial cash margin deposit and potentially require a daily adjustment to such cash deposit maintenance margin 
for example  assuming million gallons  based on the volume hedged under the fixed price program as of september   a cent per gallon decline in the market value of these hedged instruments would create an additional cash margin requirement of approximately million  while a cent per gallon increase in market value would provide million in available margin 
in this example  availability in the short term is reduced  as we fund the margin call 
this availability reduction should be temporary  as we should be able to purchase product at a later date for cents a gallon less than the anticipated strike price when the agreement with the price protected customer was entered into 
in addition  a spike in wholesale heating oil prices could also reduce availability  as we must finance a portion of our inventory and accounts receivable with internally generated cash as the net advance for eligible accounts receivable is and to of eligible inventory 
we may also borrow up to million against fixed assets and customer lists  which is reduced by million each year over the life of the agreement 
in addition  due to our current credit position  the ability to execute certain over the counter hedging strategies  which do not require margin adjustments  has been curtailed 

table of contents at any given time  the volume hedged under our price protected program will be less than the expected volume to be sold annually under this program as the renewals for this program are staggered throughout the year 
for example  the hedged balance remaining at september  for a price protection arrangement entered into in january will represent approximately of the customer s annual consumption 
we hedge home heating oil volume for fixed price customers at the time they renew their protected price contract 
for example  if a protected price customer s contract expires in july and the customer does not renew its contract until october  this customer becomes a variable price customer until the time that he she renews their contract  and as such there would not be a hedge in place at september  for the purchase of this customer s anticipated volume usage 
we would hedge the anticipated volume in october at the time of the customer s contract renewal 
as of september   the accounts receivable net of allowances totaled million  which represents an increase of million when compared to the balance as of september  of million 
our ability to collect these receivables over the upcoming months will impact our borrowing base availability  as the borrowing base  which is used to measure availability  does not include accounts receivable over days past due 
at september  accounts receivable over days past due were approximately million compared to million as of september  or an increase of million 
a component of accounts receivable at september  represent amounts due from customers under a budget payment plan  which permits a customer to pay their annual consumption ratably over the year 
as of september   the aggregate amount due from budget customers over days past due whose billings exceeded their payments was million  compared to million at september  this increase of million is primarily due to the increase in the per gallon selling price of home heating oil 
in addition  we have million of accounts over days past due at september  for certain commercial accounts  compared to million at september  prior to october   we were generally able to obtain trade credit from home heating oil suppliers of two to three business days 
since october   we must now prepay for our heating oil supply by at least two days 
the loss of trade credit has reduced availability 
availability is also negatively impacted by outstanding letters of credit 
as of september   million in letters of credit have been issued  primarily for current and future insurance reserves 
in fiscal  we expect to issue an additional million in letters of credit in connection with our insurance renewal 
for the majority of our fiscal year  the amount of cash received from customers with a budget payment plan is greater than actual billings 
this amount is reflected on the balance sheet under the caption customer credit balances 
at september   customer credit balances aggregated million 
generally  customer credit balances are at their low point after the end of the heating season and peak prior to the beginning of the heating season 
at september   customer credit balances were million 
during the non heating season  cash is provided from customer credit balances to fund operating activities 
if net receipts from budget customers are reduced  cash availability in the non heating season will be reduced and we will need to borrow under the revolving credit facility to fund operations 
before august  we must implement certain changes to ensure compliance with amended environmental protection agency regulations 
we currently estimate that the capital required to effectuate these requirements will range from to million 
annual maintenance capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately million  excluding the capital requirements for environmental compliance 
in general  the partnership has distributed to its partners on a quarterly basis  all available cash 
available cash is defined for any of the partnership s fiscal quarters  as all cash on hand at the end of that quarter  less the amount of cash reserves that are necessary or appropriate in the reasonable discretion of the general partner to i provide for the proper conduct of the business  ii comply with applicable law  any of its debt instruments or other agreements  or iii provide funds for distributions to the common unitholders and the senior subordinated unitholders during the next four quarters  in some circumstances 
on october   we announced that we would not pay a distribution on the common units 
we had previously announced the suspension of distributions on the senior subordinated units on july  the partnership did not pay distributions on any of its outstanding units in fiscal it is unlikely that regular distributions on the common units or senior subordinated units will be resumed in the foreseeable future 
while we hope to position ourself to pay some regular distribution on our common units in future years  of which there can be no assurance  it is considerably less likely that regular distributions will ever resume on the senior subordinated units because of their subordination terms and the existing arrearages on our common units 
the revolving credit facility and the indenture for the mlp notes both impose certain restrictions on our ability to pay distributions to unitholders 
it is unlikely that regular distributions on the common units or senior subordinated units will be resumed in the foreseeable future

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to establish accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
star gas evaluates its policies and estimates on an on going basis 
the partnership s consolidated financial statements may differ based upon different estimates and assumptions 
the partnership s critical accounting estimates have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies and estimates goodwill and other intangible assets we calculate amortization using the straight line method over periods ranging from five to ten years for intangible assets with definite useful lives 
we use amortization methods and determine asset values based on our best estimates using reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections 
we assess the useful lives of intangible assets based on the estimated period over which we will receive 
table of contents benefit from such intangible assets such as historical evidence regarding customer churn rate 
in some cases  the estimated useful lives are based on contractual terms 
at september   we had million of net intangible assets subject to amortization 
if circumstances required a change in estimated useful lives of the assets  it could have a material effect on results of operations 
for example  if lives were shortened by one year  we estimate that amortization for these assets for fiscal would have increased by approximately million 
sfas no 
requires goodwill to be assessed at least annually for impairment 
these assessments involve management s estimates of future cash flows  market trends and other factors to determine the fair value of the reporting unit  which includes the goodwill to be assessed 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value and is determined to be impaired  an impairment charge is recorded to write down goodwill to its fair value 
at september   we had million of goodwill 
intangible assets with finite lives must be assessed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
similar to goodwill  the assessment for impairment requires estimates of future cash flows related to the intangible asset 
to the extent the carrying value of the assets exceeds its future undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is recorded based on the fair value of the asset 
we test the carrying amount of goodwill annually during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 
during the second quarter of fiscal  a number of events occurred that indicated a possible impairment of goodwill of the heating oil segment might exist 
these events included the determination in february that we could expect to generate significantly lower than expected operating results for the heating oil segment for the year and a significant decline in the partnership s unit price 
as a result of these triggering events and circumstances  we completed an interim sfas no 
impairment review of the heating oil segment with the assistance of a third party valuation firm as of february  the evaluation utilized both an income and market valuation approach and contained reasonable assumptions and reflected management s best estimate of projected future cash flows 
this review resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately million  which reduced the carrying amount of goodwill of the heating oil segment 
as of august   we performed our annual goodwill impairment valuation for its heating oil segment  with the assistance of a third party valuation firm 
based upon this analysis  we determined that there is no additional goodwill impairment as of august  depreciation of property  plant and equipment depreciation is calculated using the straight line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from to years 
net property  plant and equipment was million at september  if circumstances required a change in estimated useful lives of the assets  it could have a material effect on results of operations 
for example  if the remaining estimated useful lives of these assets were shortened by one year  we estimate that depreciation for fiscal would have increased by approximately million 
fair values of derivatives the fair market value of all derivative instruments is recognized as an asset or liability on our balance sheet 
the accounting treatment for the changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is i a cash flow hedge or ii a fair value hedge  and upon whether or not the derivative qualifies as an effective hedge 
changes in the fair value of effective cash flow hedges are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
for fair value hedges  to the extent the hedge is effective there is no effect on the statement of operations as changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument offset changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
for derivative instruments that do not qualify  or are not treated as hedge accounting  changes in fair value are recognized currently in earnings 
the estimated fair value of our derivative instruments requires judgement on our part 
we have established the fair value of our derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties and subsequently evaluated them internally using established index prices and other sources 
these values are based upon  among other things  future prices  volatility  time to maturity value and credit risk 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions  or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  other factors that can impact results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between changes in the fair value of our hedge instruments and those transactions being hedged effectiveness both at inception and on an on going basis 
the factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our commodity hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions  market and otherwise  which may be beyond our control 
defined benefit obligations sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions as amended by sfas no 
employers disclosure about pensions and other postretirement benefits requires the partnership to make assumptions as to the expected long term rate of return that could be achieved on defined benefit plan assets and discount rates to determine the present value of the plans pension obligations 
the partnership evaluates these critical assumptions at least annually 
the discount rate enables the partnership to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
the rate is required to represent the market rate for high quality fixed income investments 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
a basis point decrease in the discount rated used for fiscal would have 
table of contents increased pension expense by approximately million and would have increased the minimum pension liability by another million 
the discount rate used to determine net periodic pension expense was in and in and the discount rate used by the partnership in determining pension expense and pension obligations reflects the yield of high quality aa or better rating by a recognized rating agency corporate bonds whose cash flows are expected to match the timing and amounts of future benefit payments 
the discount rates to determine net periodic expense used in each of and and reflect the decline in applicable bond yields over the past year 
we consider the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets to determine our expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is developed with input from the partnership s qualified actuaries 
the long term rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for fiscals and was 
a further basis point decrease in the expected return on assets would have increased pension expense in fiscal by approximately million 
over the life of the plans  both gains and losses have been recognized by the plans in the calculation of annual pension expense 
as of september   million of unrecognized losses remain to be recognized by the plans 
these losses may result in increases in future pension expense as they are recognized 
allowance for doubtful accounts we periodically review past due customer accounts receivable balances 
after giving consideration to economic conditions  overdue status and other factors  the heating oil segment establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts  which it deems sufficient to cover future potential losses 
actual losses could differ from management s estimates  however  based on historical experience  we do not expect our estimate of uncollectible accounts to vary significantly from actual losses 
insurance reserves we currently self insure a portion of workers compensation  auto and general liability claims 
we establish reserves based upon expectations as to what our ultimate liability may be for outstanding claims using developmental factors based upon historical claim experience 
we periodically evaluate the potential for changes in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries 
as of september   we had approximately million of insurance reserves 
the ultimate resolution of these claims could differ materially from the assumptions used to calculate the reserves  which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our bank credit facilities 
we utilize these borrowings to meet our working capital needs 
at september   we had outstanding borrowings totaling million  of which approximately million is subject to variable interest rates under our bank credit facilities 
in the event that interest rates associated with these facilities were to increase basis points  the impact on future cash flows would be a decrease of less than million 
we also selectively use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to market risk related to changes in the current and future market price of home heating oil 
the value of market sensitive derivative instruments is subject to change as a result of movements in market prices 
consistent with the nature of hedging activity  associated unrealized gains and losses would be offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the purchase price we would pay for the home heating oil being hedged 
sensitivity analysis is a technique used to evaluate the impact of hypothetical market value changes 
based on a hypothetical ten percent increase in the cost of product at september   the potential impact on our hedging activity would be to increase the fair market value of these outstanding derivatives by million to a fair market value of million  and conversely a hypothetical ten percent decrease in the cost of product would decrease the fair market value of these outstanding derivatives by million to a fair market value of million
