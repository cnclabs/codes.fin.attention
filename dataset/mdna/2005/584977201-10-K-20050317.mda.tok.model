critical accounting policies the company has identified the policies outlined below as critical to understanding its business and results of operations 
the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the company s business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see 
note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item on form k  beginning on page note that the preparation of this form k requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
the company s critical accounting policies are as follows accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customers current credit worthiness  as determined by management s review of their current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon the company s historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have generally been within the company s historical expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that have occurred in the past 
the company s consolidated trade accounts receivable balance as of december  was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
some of the company s laboratory services revenues for certain types of tests are billed to third party payors including insurance companies  state medicaid and medicare agencies 
these payors pay for such services at established amounts  which are typically lower than gross amounts billed by the company 
however  the tests are sometimes billed directly to patients or other parties and paid at the gross amount billed for these tests 
in addition  billings for the tests are occasionally re billed to alternative payors in situations where incorrect billing information was submitted to the company by the customer 
the company estimates a discount on the billings for these tests  and recognizes revenue and related accounts receivable at a net amount  after discount  in order to state revenue and accounts receivable at the amount expected to be paid 
while the company believes that estimated discounts and the related net revenue and net accounts receivable from these testing services are materially correct  there can be differences in amounts ultimately paid compared to estimated amounts 
these differences are recorded upon payment and may affect previously recorded amounts 
the company considers historical discounts when estimating future discounts on a monthly basis 
off site supplies inventory off site supplies represents collection kits and forms located at collections sites throughout the united states used by laboratory services customers to submit specimens for testing services 
at december   off site inventory was million 
the process for valuing off site inventory involves significant assumptions regarding the average time that a collection site uses the inventory  as well as the amount of inventory expected to be scrapped 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on january  sfas no 
provides that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  but are instead reviewed for impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances 
the company completed the necessary transition impairment review for goodwill and other intangible assets in  and determined that there was no impairment 
the company performs its annual impairment test for goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year 
no impairments were indicated as a result of the annual impairment reviews for goodwill and other intangible assets in  and in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  projections regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors are made to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and tax planning strategies  and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company increases or decreases the valuation allowance in a period  the company must include an expense or benefit within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the company s deferred tax assets primarily consist of certain net operating losses nols carried forward 
at december   the company had a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of million  which represents the portion of its nol carryforwards that will more likely than not expire unused in and future years 
the valuation allowance is based on management s estimate of future taxable income  the period over which nols will be recoverable  and tax planning strategies 
in the future  subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of these deferred tax assets could cause the provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although the company s cash payments would remain unaffected until the benefit of the nols is completely utilized or expires unused 
results of operations overview in  the company achieved record revenues driven by strong sample volume from both new and existing workplace and occupational health clients as well as strong sales of profile ii products
