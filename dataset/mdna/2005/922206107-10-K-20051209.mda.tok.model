item business general overview and history varian  inc  together with its subsidiaries collectively  the company  designs  develops  manufactures  markets  sells and services scientific instruments including related software  consumable products  accessories and services and vacuum products and related accessories and services 
our operations are grouped into two corresponding segments scientific instruments and vacuum technologies 
these segments  their products and the applications in which they are used are described below 

table of contents varian  inc became a separate  public company on april  until that date  our business was operated as the instruments business of varian associates  inc vai 
the instruments business which included the business units that designed  developed  manufactured  marketed  sold and serviced scientific instruments and vacuum technologies  and a business unit that provided contract electronics manufacturing services was contributed by vai to us 
on that date  vai distributed to holders of its common stock one share of our common stock and one share of common stock of varian semiconductor equipment associates  inc vsea  which was formerly operated as the semiconductor equipment business of vai  for each share of vai common stock outstanding on april  the distribution 
vai retained its health care systems business and changed its name to varian medical systems  inc vms 
these transactions were accomplished under the terms of an amended and restated distribution agreement dated as of january  by and among us  vai and vsea the distribution agreement 
for purposes of allocating certain obligations and liabilities between and among us  vms and vsea after the distribution  we  vms and vsea also entered into certain other agreements which include an employee benefits allocation agreement  an intellectual property agreement and a tax sharing agreement 
until march   we operated an electronics manufacturing business  which was a contract manufacturer of electronic assemblies and subsystems such as printed circuit boards for original equipment manufacturers oems 
on that date  the electronics manufacturing business was sold to jabil circuit  inc as a result  our former electronics manufacturing business has been treated as a discontinued operation throughout this annual report on form k and is therefore excluded from all disclosures pertaining to our continuing operations 
business segments and products for financial reporting purposes  we have two business segments scientific instruments and vacuum technologies  which are described below 
however  the products and activities of these two segments are related in certain important respects  particularly product applications 
in many ways  therefore  we view  manage  operate and describe our company as being comprised of a single business

in addition to product sales  we also offer a wide range of services including an exchange and rebuild program  assistance with the design and integration of vacuum systems  applications support and training in basic and advanced vacuum technologies 
information rich detection products we refer to certain of the products described above as information rich detectors ird 
ird products include mass spectrometers  nmr systems  mr imaging systems and ft ir instruments 
all of these products provide users with multi dimensional layers of information  which are critical to the ability to optimize analyses and processes 
ird instruments typically provide broad based qualitative capabilities for screening of compounds in complex mixtures  precise quantitative information for determining the relative concentrations of the compounds and dimensions of structural information for confirming the identify of the analytes 
our ird products also include superconducting magnets  vacuum pumps  consumables and other products used either in or with our ird instruments or sold directly to oems and end users for use in ird products  as well as various services we provide in connection with our ird products 
customers and applications our products are sold principally for use in life science applications or for use in industrial applications although many products are used in both applications 
life science applications include the study of biological processes and the testing of biological materials 
almost all of the scientific instruments products described above are or can be used in life science applications  such as by pharmaceutical companies in drug development  manufacturing and quality control  and by research hospitals and universities in basic chemistry  biological  biochemistry and health care research 
life science customers include branded and generic pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology and toxicology companies  governmental agencies and numerous academic institutions and research hospitals 
the vacuum technologies products described above similarly are or can be used in a broad range of life science applications  such as in mass spectrometers for analytical analysis and in linear accelerators for cancer therapy 
in fiscal years  and  sales into life science applications accounted for nearly half of our total sales these are estimates based on assumptions of how our products are likely to be used by customers  and are provided only as an indication of a historical trend 
almost all of the scientific instruments products described above are or can also be used in industrial applications  such as by environmental laboratories in performing chemical analyses of water  soil  air  solids and food products  by petroleum and natural gas companies in performing chemical analyses in refining and quality control  by petroleum  agriculture  chemical  mining and metallurgy and food and beverage processing companies in conducting research and quality control  and by other industrial  governmental and academic research laboratories in forensic analysis  materials science and general research 
the vacuum technologies products described above are or can be used in a broad range of industrial applications  such as in the manufacture of flat panel displays  television tubes  decorative coating  architectural glass  optical lenses  light bulbs and automobile components  in food packaging  in the testing of aircraft components  automobile airbags  refrigeration components and industrial processing equipment  in high energy physics research  and in the manufacture of semiconductors and fabrication and metrology equipment 

table of contents marketing and sales in the us  we market and sell the largest portion of our products through our own direct sales organizations  although a few products and services are marketed and sold through independent sales representatives and distributors 
sales outside of the us are generally made by our direct sales organizations  although some sales are made directly from the us to customers outside of the us in addition  in certain countries outside of the us  sales are made through various sales representative and distributor arrangements 
to support this marketing and sales structure  we have sales and service offices in various locations in the us and  through our subsidiaries  in various non us locations 
the markets in which we compete are  for the most part  global 
sales outside of north america accounted for  and of sales for fiscal years  and  respectively 
as a result  our customers increasingly require service and support on a worldwide basis 
in addition to the us  we have sales and service offices located throughout europe  asia and latin america 
we have invested substantial financial and management resources to develop an international infrastructure to meet the needs of our customers worldwide 
demand for our products depends on many factors  including the level of capital expenditures of our customers  the rate of economic growth in our major markets and competitive considerations 
no single customer accounted for or more of our sales in fiscal year  or we experience some cyclical patterns in sales of our products 
generally  sales and earnings in the first quarter of our fiscal year are lower when compared to the preceding fourth fiscal quarter  primarily because there are fewer working days in the first fiscal quarter october to december 
sales and earnings in our third fiscal quarter are usually flat to down sequentially compared to the second fiscal quarter  primarily because there are a number of holidays in the early part of the quarter  especially in europe  and the june quarter end has no significant customer year ends to influence orders 
our fourth fiscal quarter sales and earnings are often the highest in the fiscal year compared to the other three quarters  primarily because many government and research related customers spend budgeted money before their own fiscal years end 
this cyclical pattern can be influenced by other factors  including the timing of revenue recognition on large systems  general economic conditions  acquisitions  new product introductions and products requiring long manufacturing and installation lead times such as nmr and mr imaging systems and superconducting magnets 
we believe that we differentiate our products from those of our competitors by our responsiveness to customer requirements  as determined through market research 
although specific customer requirements can vary depending on applications  customers generally demand superior performance  ease of use  high quality  high productivity and low cost of ownership 
we have responded to these customer demands by introducing new products focused on these requirements in the markets we serve 
backlog our recorded backlog including deferred revenue included in the consolidated balance sheet was million at september   million at october  and million at october  backlog increased from october  to september  primarily due to stronger order volume for scientific instruments products  particularly with respect to mr imaging systems  and the acquisition of magnex scientific limited magnex in november the change in backlog from october  to october  was not significant 
we include in backlog purchase orders or production releases under blanket purchase orders that have firm delivery dates 
recorded backlog in us dollars is impacted by foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  recorded backlog might not result in sales because of cancellations or other factors 

table of contents most of our products are shipped soon after they are ordered by customers  with the time between order receipt and shipment being as short as a few days for some products and less than a fiscal quarter for most others 
however  other products  in particular certain nmr and mr imaging systems and superconducting magnets  can have significantly longer lead times  sometimes in excess of one year 
significant shipments often occur in the last month of each quarter  in part because of how customers place orders and schedule shipments 
we believe that over of orders included in our backlog at september  will result in revenue before the end of fiscal year however  this percentage should not be taken as an indicator for orders received after september  because of the longer lead times associated with our superconducting magnets  particularly those for use in mr imaging systems 
competition competition in markets we serve is primarily based upon the performance capabilities of products  technical support and after market service  the manufacturer s reputation as a technological leader and product pricing 
we believe that performance capabilities are the most important of these criteria 
the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and are characterized by the application of advanced technology 
there are numerous companies that specialize in  and a number of larger companies that devote a significant portion of their resources to  the development  manufacture  sale and service of products that compete with those that we manufacture  sell or service 
many of our competitors are well known manufacturers with a high degree of technical proficiency 
in addition  competition is intensified by the ever changing nature of the technologies in the industries in which we are engaged 
the markets for our products are characterized by specialized manufacturers that often have strength in narrow segments of these markets 
while the absence of reliable statistics makes it difficult to determine our relative market position in our industry segments  we are one of the principal manufacturers in our primary fields 
both of our business segments compete with many companies that address the same markets 
our scientific instruments segment competes primarily with agilent  bruker  jeol  perkinelmer  shimadzu  thermo electron  waters and other smaller suppliers 
our vacuum technologies segment competes primarily with adixen alcatel  boc edwards  inficon  leybold  pfeiffer  ulvac and other smaller suppliers 
manufacturing our principal manufacturing activities consist of precision assembly  test  calibration and certain specialized machining activities 
for most of our products  we subcontract a portion of the assembly and machining  but perform all other assembly  test and calibration functions 
we believe that the ability to manufacture reliable products in a cost effective manner is critical to meeting the just in time delivery and other demanding requirements of our oem and end user customers 
we monitor and analyze product lead times  warranty data  process yields  supplier performance  field data on mean time between failures  inventory turns  repair response times and other indicators so that we can continuously improve our manufacturing processes 
as of september   we operated significant manufacturing facilities located throughout the world 
our scientific instruments segment had manufacturing facilities in palo alto  california  walnut creek  california  lake forest  california  ft 
collins  colorado  randolph  massachusetts  cary  north carolina  melbourne  australia  grenoble  france  middelburg  netherlands  and yarnton  united kingdom 
in november  we acquired a manufacturing facility in church stretton  united kingdom  as a result of our acquisition of polymer labs  which is now part of our scientific instruments segment 
our vacuum technologies segment had manufacturing facilities in lexington  massachusetts  and turin  italy 
all of our significant manufacturing facilities  other than grenoble  france  have been certified as complying with the international organization for standardization series quality standards iso 

table of contents raw materials there are no specialized raw materials that are particularly essential to the operation of our business 
our manufacturing operations require a wide variety of raw materials  electronic and mechanical components  chemical and biochemical materials and other supplies  some of which are occasionally in short supply 
in addition  use of certain of our products requires reliable and cost effective supply of certain raw materials 
for example  end users of our nmr and mr imaging systems and superconducting magnets require helium to operate those systems  shortages of helium could result in higher helium prices  and thus higher operating costs for nmr and mr imaging systems and superconducting magnets  which could impact demand for those products 
we manufacture some components used in our products 
other components  including certain superconducting magnets and electronic subassemblies  are purchased from other manufacturers 
most of the raw materials  components and supplies we purchase are available from a number of different suppliers  however  a number of items in particular  certain superconducting magnets for nmr systems  wire used in superconducting magnets and electronic subassemblies used in scientific instruments are purchased from limited or single sources of supply 
disruption of these sources could cause delays or reductions in shipment of our products or increases in our costs  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
research and development we are actively engaged in basic and applied research  development and engineering programs designed to develop new products and to improve existing products 
during fiscal years  and  we spent million  million and million  respectively  on research  development and engineering activities 
over this period  the focus of our research and development activities has been shifting more toward information rich detection products 
we intend to continue to conduct extensive research and development activities  with a continued emphasis on information rich detection products such as nmr and mr imaging systems  superconducting magnets  mass spectrometers including vacuum products for use in oem mass spectrometers and certain consumable products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and market new products on a cost effective and timely basis  that such products will compete favorably with products developed by others or that our existing technology will not be superseded by new discoveries or developments 
customer support and service we believe that our customer service and support are an integral part of our competitive strategy 
as part of our support services  our applications and technical support staff provides individual assistance in supporting customers specific applications needs  solving analysis problems and integrating vacuum components 
we offer training courses and periodically send our customers information on applications development 
our products generally include a day to one year warranty  but in some countries and for some products we offer longer warranties 
service contracts may be purchased by customers to cover equipment no longer under warranty 
service work not performed under warranty or service contract is generally performed on a time and materials basis 
we install and service our products primarily through our own field service organization  although certain distributors and sales representatives are able and contracted to perform some field services 
patent and other intellectual property rights we have a policy of seeking patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection in the us and other countries for developments  improvements and inventions originating within our organization that are incorporated in our products or that fall within our fields of interest 
as of september   we owned approximately patents in the us and approximately patents throughout the world  and had numerous patent applications on file with various patent agencies worldwide 
we intend to continue to file patent applications as we deem appropriate 

table of contents we rely on a combination of copyright  trade secret and other legal  as well as contractual  restrictions on disclosure  copying and transferring title to protect our proprietary rights 
we have trademarks  both registered and unregistered  that are maintained and enforced to provide customer recognition for our products in the marketplace 
we also have agreements with third parties that provide for licensing of patented or proprietary technology 
these agreements include royalty bearing licenses and technology cross licenses 
environmental matters our operations are subject to various federal  state and local laws in the us  as well as laws in other countries  regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
these regulations increase the costs and potential liabilities of our operations 
however  our compliance with these regulations is not expected to have a material effect upon our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
for additional information on environmental matters  see item a risk factors environmental matters and governmental regulations 
employees at september   we had approximately  full time and temporary employees and contract workers worldwide approximately  in north america   in europe  in asia  in australia and in latin america 
item a 
risk factors customer demand 
demand for our products depends upon  among other factors  the level of capital expenditures by current and prospective customers  the rate of economic growth in the markets in which we compete  the level of government funding for research and the competitiveness of our products and services 
changes in any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we must continue to assess and predict customer needs  regulatory requirements and evolving technologies 
we must develop new products  including enhancements to existing products  new services and new applications  successfully commercialize  manufacture  market and sell these products and protect our intellectual property in these products 
if we are unsuccessful in these areas  our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
variability of operating results 
we experience some cyclical patterns in sales of our products 
generally  sales and earnings in the first quarter of our fiscal year are lower when compared to the preceding fourth fiscal quarter  primarily because there are fewer working days in our first fiscal quarter october to december 
sales and earnings in our third fiscal quarter are usually flat to down sequentially compared to the second fiscal quarter  primarily because there are a number of holidays in the early part of the quarter  especially in europe  and the june quarter end has no significant customer year ends to influence orders 
our fourth fiscal quarter sales and earnings are often the highest in the fiscal year compared to the other three quarters  primarily because many government and research related customers spend budgeted money before their own fiscal years end 
this cyclical pattern can be influenced by other factors  including the timing of revenue recognition on large systems  general economic conditions  acquisitions  new product introductions and products requiring long manufacturing and installation lead times such as nmr and mr imaging systems and superconducting magnets 
consequently  our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
for most of our products  we operate on a short backlog  as short as a few days for some products and less than a fiscal quarter for most others 
we also experience significant shipments in the last few weeks of each quarter  in part because of how our customers place orders and schedule shipments 
this can make it difficult for us to forecast our results of operations 

table of contents certain of our nmr and mr imaging systems  nmr probes  superconducting magnets and other related components sell on long lead times  sometimes in excess of one year 
these systems and components sell for high prices  are complex  require development of new technologies and  therefore  significant research and development resources  are often intended for evolving research applications  often have customer specific features  custom capabilities and specific acceptance criteria  and  in the case of nmr and mr imaging systems  require superconducting magnets that can be difficult to manufacture 
some superconducting magnets for our nmr systems are not manufactured by us  so our ability to ship  install and obtain customer acceptance of certain of our nmr systems is dependent upon the superconducting magnet supplier s timely development  delivery and installation of magnets that perform to customer specifications 
if we are unable to meet these challenges  it could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  all of these factors can make it difficult for us to forecast shipment  installation and acceptance of  and installation and warranty costs on  nmr and mr imaging systems  nmr probes and superconducting magnets  which in turn can make it difficult for us to forecast the timing of revenue recognition and the achieved gross profit margin on these products 
changes to financial accounting standards can also create variability in our operating results 
as discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent accounting pronouncements  the financial accounting standards board fasb has published statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  share based payments  which amends existing financial accounting standards to require that awards made under equity compensation plans be recorded as compensation expense using the fair value method 
sfas r will be effective for the first quarter of our fiscal year we are still assessing the impact of this new accounting standard  but we expect that it will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
changes in our effective tax rate can also create variability in our operating results 
in the future  effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries having lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries having higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
in addition  we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax reserves and expense 
should actual events or results differ from our current expectations  charges or credits to our income tax reserves and income tax expense may become necessary 
any such adjustments could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
competition 
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive 
we compete against many us and us companies  most with global operations 
some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we have  which may enable them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies  take advantage of acquisition opportunities  compete on price  or devote greater resources to research and development  engineering  manufacturing  marketing  sales or managerial activities 
others have greater name recognition and geographic and market presence or lower cost structures than we do 
in addition  weaker demand and excess capacity in our industries could cause greater price competition as our competitors seek to maintain sales volumes and market share 
for the foregoing reasons  competition could result in lower revenues due to lost sales or price reductions  lower margins and loss of market share  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
key suppliers 
some items we purchase for the manufacture of our products  including certain superconducting magnets used in nmr systems  wire used in superconducting magnets and electronic subassemblies used in scientific instruments  are purchased from limited or single sources of supply 
the loss of a key supplier or the inability to obtain certain key raw materials or components could cause delays or reductions in shipments of our products or increase our costs  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents we have experienced and could again experience delivery delays in superconducting magnets used in our nmr systems  which has caused and could again cause delays in our product shipments 
in addition  end users of our nmr and mr imaging systems and superconducting magnets require helium to operate those products  shortages of helium could result in higher helium prices and thus higher operating costs for nmr and mr imaging systems and superconducting magnets  which could impact demand for those products 
business interruption 
our facilities  operations and systems could be impacted by fire  flood  terrorism or other natural or man made disasters 
in particular  we have significant facilities in areas prone to earthquakes and fires  such as our production facilities and headquarters in california 
due to their limited availability  broad exclusions and prohibitive costs  we do not have insurance policies that would cover losses resulting from an earthquake 
if any of our facilities or surrounding areas were to be significantly damaged in an earthquake  fire  flood or other disaster  it could disrupt our operations  delay shipments and cause us to incur significant repair or replacement costs  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our employees based in certain countries outside of the us are subject to factory specific and or industry wide collective bargaining agreements 
of these  certain of our employees in australia are subject to a collective bargaining agreement that will need to be renewed in april a work stoppage  strike or other labor action at this or other of our facilities could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
intellectual property 
our success depends on our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements to establish and protect that intellectual property  but these protections might not be available in all countries  might not be enforceable  might not fully protect our intellectual property and might not provide meaningful competitive advantages 
moreover  we might be required to spend significant resources to police and enforce our intellectual property rights  and we might not detect infringements of those intellectual property rights 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property and enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
other third parties might claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights  and we may be unaware of intellectual property rights that we are infringing 
any litigation regarding intellectual property of others could be costly and could divert personnel and resources from our operations 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to develop non infringing alternatives or enter into royalty bearing license agreements 
we might also be required to pay damages or be enjoined from developing  manufacturing or selling infringing products 
we sometimes rely on licenses to avoid these risks  but we cannot be assured that these licenses will be available in the future or on favorable terms 
these risks could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
acquisitions 
we have acquired companies and operations and made minority equity investments in private companies  and intend to acquire companies and operations and make minority equity investments in private companies in the future  as part of our growth strategy 
these acquisitions must be carefully evaluated and negotiated if they are to be successful 
once completed  acquired operations must be carefully integrated to realize expected synergies  efficiencies and financial results 
some of the challenges in doing this include retaining key employees  managing operations in new geographic areas  retaining key customers  integrating data systems and internal controls and managing transaction costs 
all of this must be done without diverting management and other resources from other operations and activities 
additionally  acquisition related goodwill and minority equity investments in private companies are subject to regular impairment testing and potential impairment charges 
for all of these reasons  failure to successfully evaluate  negotiate and integrate acquisitions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents restructuring activities 
we have undertaken restructuring activities  and may undertake restructuring activities in the future  that we expect to result in certain costs and eventual cost savings 
these costs and cost savings are based on estimates at the time of plan commitment as to the timing of activities to be completed and the timing and amount of related costs to be incurred 
we could experience delays in completing restructuring activities and our estimates of the costs to complete these activities could change 
such events could adversely impact the eventual costs of  and savings achieved by  the restructuring activities 
as a result  these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
non us operations and currency exchange rates 
a significant portion of our sales  manufacturing activities and employees are outside of the us as a result  we are subject to various risks  including the following duties  tariffs and taxes  restrictions on currency conversions  fund transfers or profit repatriations  import  export and other trade restrictions  protective labor regulations and union contracts  compliance with local laws and regulations  as well as us laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act as they relate to our non us operations  travel and transportation difficulties  and adverse developments in political or economic environments in countries where we operate 
these risks could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
additionally  the us dollar value of our sales and operating costs varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations 
because we manufacture and sell in the us and a number of other countries  the impact that currency exchange rate fluctuations have on us is dependent on the interaction of a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the relationships between various foreign currencies  the relative amount of our revenues that are denominated in us dollars or in us dollar linked currencies  customer resistance to currency driven price changes and the suddenness and severity of changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we hedge most of our balance sheet exposures denominated in other than local currencies based upon forecasts of those exposures  in the event that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  foreign exchange losses could result 
for all of these reasons  currency exchange fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
key personnel 
our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of key personnel  including research and development  engineering  manufacturing  finance  administrative  marketing  sales and management personnel 
the availability of qualified personnel can vary significantly based on factors such as the strength of the general economy 
however  even in weak economic periods  there is still intense competition for personnel with certain expertise in the geographic areas where we compete for personnel 
in addition  certain employees have significant institutional and proprietary technical knowledge  which could be difficult to quickly replace 
failure to attract and retain qualified personnel  who generally do not have employment agreements or post employment non competition agreements  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
certain employee benefit plans 
many of our us employees participate in health care plans under which we are self insured 
we maintain a stop loss insurance policy that covers the cost of certain individually large claims under these plans 
during each year  our expenses under these plans are recorded based on actuarial estimates of the number and costs of expected claims  administrative costs  and stop loss premiums 
these estimates are then adjusted at the end of each plan year to reflect actual costs incurred 
actual costs under these plans are subject to variability depending primarily upon employee enrollment and demographics  the actual number and costs of claims made and whether and how much the stop loss insurance we purchase covers the cost of these claims 
in the event that our cost estimates differ from actual costs  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

table of contents we also maintain defined benefit pension plans for our employees in several countries outside of the us in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employers accounting for pensions  we utilize a number of assumptions including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate in order to determine our defined benefit pension plan costs each year 
these assumptions are set based on relevant debt  equity and other market conditions in the countries in which the plans are maintained 
we adjust these assumptions each year in response to corresponding changes in the underlying market conditions 
changes in these market conditions result in corresponding changes in our defined benefit pension plan assumptions  liabilities and costs 
these changes could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
environmental matters 
our operations are subject to various federal  state and local laws in the us  as well as laws in other countries  regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
these regulations increase the costs and potential liabilities of our operations 
however  we do not currently anticipate that our compliance with these regulations will have a material effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
as is described in item business  we are obligated under the terms of the distribution agreement to indemnify vms for one third of certain costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by vms for such costs relating to environmental matters 
in that regard  vms has been named by the us environmental protection agency or third parties as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  as amended  at nine sites where vai is alleged to have shipped manufacturing waste for recycling  treatment or disposal 
in addition  vms is overseeing and  as applicable  reimbursing third parties for environmental investigation  monitoring  and or remediation activities  in most cases under the direction of  or in consultation with  federal  state and or local agencies in the us  at certain current vms or former vai facilities 
we are obligated to indemnify vms for one third of these environmental investigation  monitoring and or remediation costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and taxes 
for certain of these sites and facilities  various uncertainties make it difficult to assess the likelihood and scope of further environmental related activities or to estimate the future costs of such activities if undertaken 
as of september   it was nonetheless estimated that our share of the future exposure for environmental related costs for these sites and facilities ranged in the aggregate from million to million without discounting to present value 
the time frame over which these costs are expected to be incurred varies with each site and facility  ranging up to approximately years as of september  no amount in the foregoing range of estimated future costs is believed to be more probable of being incurred than any other amount in such range  and we therefore had an accrual of million as of september  as to certain sites and facilities  sufficient knowledge has been gained to be able to better estimate the scope and certain costs of future environmental related activities 
as of september   it was estimated that our share of the future exposure for these environmental related costs for these sites and facilities ranged in the aggregate from million to million without discounting to present value 
the time frame over which these costs are expected to be incurred varies with each site and facility  ranging up to approximately years as of september  as to each of these sites and facilities  it was determined that a particular amount within the range of certain estimated costs was a better estimate of the future environmental related cost than any other amount within the range  and that the amount and timing of these future costs were reliably determinable 
together  the undiscounted amounts for these sites totaled million at september  we therefore had an accrual of million as of september   which represents the best estimate of our share of these future environmental related costs discounted at  net of inflation 
this accrual is in addition to the million described in the preceding paragraph 

table of contents at september   our reserve for environmental related costs  based upon future environmental related costs estimated by us as of that date  was calculated as follows recurring costs non recurring costs total anticipated future costs in millions fiscal year thereafter total costs less imputed interest reserve amount less current portion long term included in other liabilities the foregoing amounts are only estimates of anticipated future environmental related costs  and the amounts actually spent in the years indicated may be greater or less than such estimates 
the aggregate range of cost estimates reflects various uncertainties inherent in many environmental investigation  monitoring and remediation activities and the large number of sites where such investigation  monitoring and remediation activities are being undertaken 
an insurance company has agreed to pay a portion of certain of vai s now vms future environmental related costs for which we have an indemnification obligation  and we therefore have a long term receivable of million discounted at  net of inflation in other assets as of september  for our share of such recovery 
we have not reduced any environmental related liability in anticipation of recoveries from third parties 
management believes that our reserves for the foregoing and other environmental related matters are adequate  but as the scope of our obligation becomes more clearly defined  these reserves may be modified  and related charges against or credits to earnings may be made 
although any ultimate liability arising from environmental related matters could result in significant expenditures that  if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year  would be material to our financial statements  the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote 
based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental related events  management believes that the costs of environmental related matters are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
governmental regulations 
our businesses are subject to many governmental regulations in the us and other countries  including with respect to protection of the environment  employee health and safety  labor matters  product safety  medical devices  import  export  competition and sales to governmental entities 
these regulations are complex and change frequently 
we incur significant costs to comply with governmental regulations  costs to comply with new or changed regulations could be significant  and failure to comply could result in suspension of or restrictions on our operations  product recalls  fines  other civil and criminal penalties  private party litigation and damage to our reputation  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents as mandated by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  the sec adopted rules requiring public companies to include in their annual reports on form k a report issued by management containing their assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  the registered public accounting firm auditing the company s financial statements must attest to and report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
these new requirements were effective beginning with our fiscal year ending september  the requirements of section and their application to our operations are complex  as a result  it is difficult to estimate the cost of our section compliance activities  but those costs have been and are expected to continue to be significant 
in january  the european union eu adopted directive ec on waste electrical and electronic equipment the weee directive 
the weee directive requires eu member countries to adopt implementing legislation imposing certain responsibilities on producers manufacturers and importers in the eu of electrical and electronic equipment with respect to the collection and disposal of waste from that equipment 
certain requirements of the weee directive took effect on august   in particular the requirement that each eu member country adopt legislation implementing the weee directive in that country 
certain eu member countries where we manufacture or import products have adopted such implementing legislation although in some cases to be effective at a future date  while other eu member countries have either not yet adopted implementing legislation or have not yet adopted rules under their implementing legislation 
it is therefore not yet possible for us to fully determine or estimate the impact on us of complying with the weee directive  although we have a program underway to ensure compliance with the weee directive 
we will incur waste collection and disposal costs to comply with implementing legislation under the weee directive  but we cannot currently estimate those costs because of uncertainties on how the weee directive will be implemented in each eu member country where we manufacture or import electrical or electronic equipment 
to the extent those costs are substantial  our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  similar legislation has been or could be enacted in other countries outside the eu  the cumulative impact of which could similarly impact our financial condition or results of operations 
in january  the eu also adopted directive ec on restriction on the certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the rohs directive 
the rohs directive bans in the eu the use of certain hazardous materials in electrical and electronic equipment 
the rohs directive goes into effect on july   the date by which each eu member country is required to adopt legislation implementing the directive in that country 
certain eu member countries where we manufacture or import products have adopted such implementing legislation to be effective on july   while other eu member countries have either not yet adopted implementing legislation or have not yet adopted rules under their implementing legislation 
it is therefore not yet possible for us to fully determine or estimate the impact on us of complying with the rohs directive  although we have a program underway to ensure compliance with the directive 
we might incur increased manufacturing costs and or production delays in complying with implementing legislation under the rohs directive  but we cannot currently estimate those costs because of uncertainty on how the directive will be implemented in each eu member country where we manufacture or import electrical or electronic equipment 
to the extent those costs or delays are substantial  our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  similar legislation has been or could be enacted in other countries outside the eu  the cumulative impact of which could similarly impact our financial condition or results of operations

results of operations sale of electronics manufacturing business and discontinued operations 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we sold the business formerly operated as our electronics manufacturing segment the electronics manufacturing business to jabil circuit  inc as a result of the sale  we determined that this business should be accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us consequently  the results of operations of the electronics manufacturing business have been excluded from our results from continuing operations for all periods presented and have instead been presented on a discontinued operations basis 
earnings from these discontinued operations for fiscal years  and are discussed separately below 

table of contents fiscal year compared to fiscal year segment results the following table presents comparisons of our sales and operating earnings for both of our segments and in total for fiscal years and fiscal year ended september  october  increase decrease of sales of sales dollars in millions sales by segment scientific instruments vacuum technologies total company operating earnings by segment scientific instruments vacuum technologies total segments general corporate total company scientific instruments 
the increase in scientific instruments sales was primarily attributable to higher sales volume in all regions  but particularly outside of north america 
increased customer demand for certain information rich detection products  including those obtained through the acquisitions of magnex scientific limited magnex in the first quarter of fiscal year and product lines acquired from digilab  llc the digilab business in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  drove the higher sales volume in both life science and industrial applications 
scientific instruments operating earnings for fiscal years and include pretax restructuring and other related costs of million and million  respectively see restructuring activities below  acquisition related intangible amortization of million and million  respectively  and the impact of in process research and development charges of million and million  respectively 
in addition  operating earnings for fiscal year include amortization of million related to inventory written up in connection with the acquisitions of magnex and the digilab business 
excluding the impact of these items  the increase in operating earnings as a percentage of sales resulted primarily from sales volume leverage and the positive effect of efficiency improvements 
the increase from these positive factors was partially offset by the adverse impact of integration and transition costs relating to the magnex and digilab business acquisitions 
vacuum technologies 
vacuum technologies sales were flat when comparing fiscal year to fiscal year higher demand for products for life science applications in fiscal year was offset by lower demand for products for industrial applications  particularly in north america 
the increase in vacuum technologies operating earnings as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to a favorable product mix shift and manufacturing and quality improvements 

table of contents consolidated results the following table presents comparisons of our sales and other selected consolidated financial results for fiscal years and fiscal year ended september  october  increase decrease of sales of sales dollars in millions  except per share data total sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development purchased in process research and development total operating expenses operating earnings interest income interest expense income tax expense earnings from continuing operations net earnings per diluted share from continuing operations sales 
as discussed under the heading segment results above  sales by the scientific instruments and vacuum technologies segments in fiscal year increased by and  respectively  compared to fiscal year the overall improvement in sales was primarily attributable to demand for certain information rich detection products  including those obtained through the magnex and digilab business acquisitions 
geographically  sales in north america of million  europe of million and the rest of the world of million in fiscal year represented increases of  and  respectively  compared to fiscal year sales by the scientific instruments segment increased across all major geographic regions  as did vacuum technologies segment sales into europe and the pacific rim 
however  vacuum technologies sales into north america decreased in fiscal year  primarily as a result of lower demand from industrial customers 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal year reflects the impact of million in amortization expense related to inventory written up in connection with the magnex and the digilab business acquisitions this amount was included in cost of sales 
excluding the impact of this amortization  the increase in gross profit percentage compared to fiscal year resulted primarily from a favorable product mix shift and manufacturing and quality improvements in the vacuum technologies segment during the period 

table of contents selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year included approximately million in pretax restructuring and other related costs  approximately million in amortization expense relating to acquisition related intangible assets and a pretax loss of approximately million relating to the settlement of a defined benefit pension plan 
in comparison  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year included approximately million in pretax restructuring costs  approximately million in acquisition related intangible amortization and a pretax gain of approximately million relating to the curtailment of two defined benefit pension plans 
excluding the impact of these items  selling  general and administrative expenses were basically unchanged as a percentage of sales 
higher sales volume leverage and the positive impact of efficiency improvements were offset primarily by high sarbanes oxley act section implementation costs of approximately million in fiscal year in absolute dollars  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was also attributable to the magnex and the digilab business acquisitions 
research and development 
the increase in research and development expense as a percentage of sales was due primarily to our continued focus on new product development with an emphasis on information rich detection products and the timing of new product release activity 
in absolute dollars  the increase was also attributable to the magnex and the digilab business acquisitions 
purchased in process research and development 
in connection with the magnex acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a one time charge of approximately million for purchased in process research and development relating to several magnetic resonance mr imaging products that were in process at the time of the acquisition 
in fiscal year  we recorded a one time charge of approximately million for purchased in process research and development relating to several new digilab business products that were in process at the time of the acquisition 
restructuring activities 
fiscal year plans 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we undertook certain restructuring actions to rationalize our scientific instruments field support administration in the united kingdom following the completion of our acquisition of magnex 
these actions were undertaken to achieve operational efficiencies and eliminate redundant costs resulting from the acquisition which involved the termination of approximately employees  the consolidation of certain field support administrative functions previously located in our walton  united kingdom location to magnex s location in yarnton  united kingdom and the closure of the walton facility 
restructuring and other costs directly attributable to this plan have been included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the following table sets forth changes in our restructuring liability during fiscal year in connection with this plan employee related facilities related total in thousands balance at october  charges to expense cash payments foreign currency impacts and other adjustments balance at september  in addition to these restructuring costs  we incurred approximately million in other costs relating directly to the consolidation of certain field support administrative functions from the walton location to magnex s yarnton location during fiscal year this amount was comprised of non cash charges for accelerated depreciation of assets to be disposed of upon the closure of the walton facility and employee retention costs  which will be settled in cash 
since the inception of this plan  we have recorded approximately million in related restructuring expense and approximately million of other related costs 

table of contents during the third quarter of fiscal year  we committed to a separate plan to reorganize  consolidate and eliminate certain activities 
this plan was undertaken due to the divestiture of our electronics manufacturing business  the result of which was that we had lower revenues and reduced infrastructure requirements after the divestiture 
we determined that this required us to adjust our organization and reduce our cost structure 
under this plan  certain administrative functions within our corporate organization and scientific instruments segment were reorganized and consolidated 
this involved changes in reporting structures  consolidation of certain activities and the elimination of employee positions 
in addition  this plan involved the elimination of employee positions in certain other operations to reduce our cost structure 
we expect these activities to be completed by the second quarter of fiscal year the measures described above resulted in the elimination of a total of approximately employee positions  of which approximately were in north america and approximately were in europe 
the costs associated with this plan consist of one time termination benefits and other related costs for employees in the corporate organization and the scientific instruments segment whose positions were eliminated 
the following table sets forth changes in our restructuring liability during fiscal year in connection with this plan employee related facilities related total in thousands balance at october  charges to expense cash payments foreign currency impacts and other adjustments balance at september  in addition to the foregoing restructuring costs  we incurred approximately million in other costs  comprised of employee retention costs  relating directly to the reorganization and consolidation of certain activities and the elimination of employee positions 
this amount will be settled in cash 
since the inception of this plan  we have recorded approximately million in related restructuring expense and approximately million of other related costs 
fiscal year plans 
during fiscal year  we undertook certain restructuring actions to reorganize the management structure in our scientific instruments factories in australia and the netherlands 
these actions were undertaken to narrow the strategic and operational focus of these factories and involved the termination of three employees 
these actions were initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and were completed in the second quarter of fiscal year all severance and other employee related costs relating to this restructuring plan were initially recorded and included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  an adjustment to these amounts was recorded during fiscal year this restructuring plan did not involve any non cash components 
under this plan  we recorded related restructuring expense of approximately million 
the following table sets forth changes in our liability during fiscal year in connection with this plan employee related facilities related total in thousands balance at october  charges to expense cash payments foreign currency impacts and other adjustments balance at september  plan completed 
table of contents also during fiscal year  we committed to a separate plan to reorganize our scientific instruments and corporate marketing organizations and to consolidate certain scientific instruments administrative functions in north america 
this plan  which involved the termination of approximately employees  was undertaken to more closely align the strategic and operational focus of these organizations across different product lines and to improve efficiency and reduce operating costs 
these actions were initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year all severance and other employee related costs relating to this restructuring plan were initially recorded and included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year this restructuring plan did not involve any non cash components 
under this plan  we recorded related restructuring expense of approximately million 
the following table sets forth changes in our restructuring liability during fiscal year in connection with this plan employee related facilities related total in thousands balance at october  reversals of expense  net cash payments foreign currency impacts and other adjustments balance at september  plan completed fiscal year plan 
during fiscal year  we undertook certain restructuring actions to improve efficiency and more closely align employee skill sets and other resources with our evolving product mix as a result of our continued emphasis on nuclear magnetic resonance nmr  mass spectroscopy and consumable products  with a bias toward life science applications 
in addition  actions were undertaken to create a more efficient consumable products operation 
these actions primarily impacted the scientific instruments segment and involved the termination of approximately employees principally in sales and marketing  administration  service and manufacturing functions  the closure of three sales offices and the consolidation of three consumable products factories into one in southern california 
substantially all of these activities were completed during fiscal year except for the termination of approximately employees  which took place in the second and third quarters of fiscal year and the southern california facility consolidation  which was initiated in the third quarter of fiscal year and was substantially completed in the first quarter of fiscal year costs relating to restructuring activities recorded under this plan have been included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the following table sets forth changes in our restructuring liability during fiscal year in connection with this plan employee related facilities related total in thousands balance at october  charges to expense  net cash payments foreign currency impacts and other adjustments balance at september  we expect to settle all remaining employee related liabilities by the end of fiscal year  while facility related payments are currently expected to run through fiscal year the non cash portion of restructuring costs recorded in connection with these restructuring actions was not significant  either in the aggregate or for any single fiscal period 
since the inception of this plan  we have recorded approximately million in related restructuring expense and approximately million in other related costs 

table of contents restructuring cost savings 
when they were initiated  each of the foregoing restructuring plans was eventually expected to result in a reduction in annual operating expenses 
the following table sets forth the estimated annual cost savings for each plan as well as where those cost savings were expected to be realized restructuring plan estimated annual cost savings fiscal year plan scientific instruments resource realignment including employee terminations  sales office closures and southern california consumable product factory consolidation million million fiscal year plan scientific instruments factory management million million fiscal year plan scientific instruments and corporate marketing organizations  scientific instruments administrative functions million million fiscal year plan scientific instruments united kingdom field support administration million million fiscal year plan scientific instruments and corporate administrative functions million million these estimated cost savings are expected to primarily impact selling  general and administrative expenses and  to a lesser extent  cost of sales 
some of these cost savings have been and will continue to be reinvested in other parts of our business  for example  as part of our continued emphasis on information rich detection and consumable products 
in addition  unrelated cost increases in other areas of our operations have and could in the future offset some or all of these cost savings 
although it is difficult to quantify with any precision our actual cost savings to date from these activities  many of which are still ongoing  we currently believe that the ultimate savings realized will not differ materially from our initial estimates 
interest income 
the increase in interest income in fiscal year reflects the impact of net cash received from the sale of the electronics manufacturing business and  to a lesser extent  some increase in interest rates on invested cash 
income tax expense 
the effective income tax rate was for fiscal year  compared to for fiscal year the lower rate in fiscal year was primarily due to two separate discrete  one time events that resulted in reductions of income tax expense during fiscal year the first discrete tax item  which resulted from a change in the treatment of foreign tax credits under a new us law enacted during fiscal year  reduced income tax expense by approximately million 
the second discrete item  which resulted from the elimination of withholding tax on certain dividends under a new tax law enacted in switzerland during fiscal year  reduced income tax expense by approximately million 
the aggregate reduction in income tax expense due to these discrete items of approximately million was partially offset by the impact of a non deductible purchased in process research and development charge of approximately million recorded in connection with the acquisition of magnex 
excluding the impact of these items  the effective income tax rate for fiscal year was relatively constant compared to the rate for fiscal year earnings from continuing operations 
earnings from continuing operations for fiscal year reflect the impact of approximately million in pretax restructuring and other related costs  approximately million in pretax acquisition related intangible amortization  approximately million in pretax amortization related to inventory written up in connection with acquisitions  an in process research and development charge of approximately million related to the magnex acquisition  a pretax loss of approximately million relating to the settlement of a defined benefit pension plan and a reduction of income tax expense of approximately million relating to discrete  one time tax events during the period 
earnings from continuing operations for fiscal year reflect the impact of approximately million in pretax restructuring and other related costs  approximately million in pretax acquisition related intangible amortization  a pretax gain of approximately million relating to the curtailment of two defined benefit pension plans and an in process research and development charge of approximately million related to the digilab acquisition 
excluding the impact of these items  the increase in earnings from continuing operations resulted primarily from increased sales volume due  in part  to the magnex and the digilab business acquisitions  partially offset by integration and transition costs relating to these acquisitions and by high sarbanes oxley act section implementation costs 

table of contents earnings from discontinued operations 
earnings from discontinued operations include earnings from the operations of the disposed electronics manufacturing business as well as the one time gain recorded on the sale of that business 
during fiscal year  we recorded approximately million in earnings generated by the operations of the disposed business net of tax and approximately million net of tax relating to the one time gain on the sale 
earnings generated by the operations of the disposed business were approximately million net of tax in fiscal year excluding the one time gain on the sale transaction  the decrease in earnings from discontinued operations was primarily due to the inclusion of the results of only weeks of operations in fiscal year the period prior to when the sale was completed compared to a full weeks of operations in fiscal year subsequent event acquisition of pl international limited 
on november   we acquired pl international limited polymer labs for approximately million in cash net of acquired cash  subject to certain net asset adjustments 
under the terms of that acquisition  we might make additional purchase price payments of up to million over a three year period  depending on the performance of the polymer labs business relative to certain financial targets 
polymer labs designs  develops  manufactures  markets  sells and services consumable products and instrumentation for advanced polymer analysis  including columns  standards and specialized chromatography systems for gel permeation chromatography gpc analysis  and systems for process monitoring of polymeric materials 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year segment results the following table presents comparisons of our sales and operating earnings for both of our segments and in total for fiscal years and fiscal year ended october  october  increase decrease of sales of sales dollars in millions sales by segment scientific instruments vacuum technologies total company operating earnings by segment scientific instruments vacuum technologies total segments general corporate total company scientific instruments 
the increase in scientific instruments sales was primarily attributable to higher volume  particularly in europe 
to a lesser extent  the weaker us dollar also contributed to the increase in sales  principally in europe 
general economic improvement and increased customer demand for our newer products drove increased sales in both life science and industrial applications 

table of contents scientific instruments operating earnings reflect pretax restructuring and other related costs of approximately million and approximately million in fiscal years and  respectively see restructuring activities below  and acquisition related intangible amortization of approximately million and approximately million  respectively 
in addition  operating earnings in fiscal year include the impact of an in process research and development charge of approximately million 
excluding the impact of these items  the decrease in operating earnings as a percentage of sales resulted primarily from lower gross profit margins  which were adversely affected by a mix shift toward lower margin high field nmr systems and leading edge cold probes for nmr and away from higher margin low field nmr systems and by higher sales and marketing costs 
sales and marketing costs were higher as a percentage of sales due to higher order based commissions and the weaker us dollar  which increased costs for most non us operations 
the decrease in operating earnings as a percentage of sales from these factors was partially offset by stronger sales of higher margin mass spectrometry products 
vacuum technologies 
the sales increase in vacuum technologies resulted primarily from an increase in the volume of products sold into both life science and industrial applications 
in life science applications  sales growth was driven by increased demand for turbomolecular pumps for use in oem mass spectrometers 
industrial sales growth came from higher demand for pumps for broad industrial uses including semiconductor applications 
to a lesser extent  the weaker us dollar also contributed to the increase in sales  particularly in europe 
the increase in vacuum technologies operating earnings as a percentage of sales in fiscal year was primarily attributable to higher gross profit margins due to sales volume leverage and a mix shift toward higher margin products as well as approximately million in a patent suit settlement and approximately million of pretax restructuring costs that were incurred in fiscal year vacuum technologies operating costs were also lower as a percentage of sales in fiscal year  primarily due to sales volume leverage 
consolidated results the following table presents comparisons of our sales and other selected consolidated financial results for fiscal years and fiscal year ended october  october  increase decrease of sales of sales dollars in millions  except per share data sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development purchased in process research and development total operating expenses operating earnings interest income interest expense income tax expense earnings from continuing operations net earnings per diluted share from continuing operations 
table of contents sales 
as shown above  fiscal year sales by the scientific instruments and vacuum technologies segments increased by and  respectively  compared to fiscal year sales 
the improvement in sales was primarily attributable to general economic improvement and continued acceptance of our newer products  which was partially offset by the shorter fiscal year which comprised weeks compared to fiscal year which comprised weeks 
geographically  sales in north america of million  europe of million and the rest of the world of million in fiscal year represented increases of  and  respectively  compared to fiscal year both segments experienced an increase in sales across all major geographic regions that they served except for scientific instruments sales into north america  which were flat and the pacific rim  which were lower 
the decrease in sales in the pacific rim in fiscal year was primarily due to lower sales of high field nmr systems into that region as compared to fiscal year this decrease was partially offset by continued growth in sales of other scientific instruments and vacuum technologies products into the pacific rim and higher scientific instruments sales into latin america 
the overall increase in north america sales was primarily due to higher demand for products from the vacuum technologies segment 
the increase in europe was driven by improved scientific instruments and vacuum technologies sales  in part  this reflects the currency effect of the stronger euro in fiscal year gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was higher due to an increased gross profit percentage in the vacuum technologies segment  primarily as a result of sales volume leverage and a mix shift toward higher margin products 
in the scientific instruments segment  the adverse impact of a mix shift toward lower margin high field nmr systems and nmr cold probes and away from higher margin low field nmr systems was offset by the impact of stronger sales of higher margin mass spectrometry products and application based consumable products in fiscal year selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year included approximately million in pretax restructuring and other related costs  approximately million in amortization expense relating to acquisition related intangible assets and a pretax gain of approximately million relating to the curtailment of two defined benefit pension plans 
in comparison  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year included approximately million in pretax restructuring costs  approximately million in acquisition related intangible amortization and a pretax patent suit settlement of million 
excluding the impact of these items  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased in fiscal year primarily as a result of higher sales volume leverage 
research and development 
research and development spending was relatively constant as a percentage of sales  as we increased our investment in research and development  particularly in the areas of nmr and mr imaging  mass spectroscopy and consumable products  with a bias toward life science applications 
restructuring activities 
fiscal year plans 
during fiscal year  we undertook certain restructuring actions to reorganize the management structure in our scientific instruments factories in australia and the netherlands 
these actions were undertaken to narrow the strategic and operational focus of these factories and involved the termination of three employees 
these actions were initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and were completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year all severance and other employee related costs relating to this restructuring plan were initially recorded and included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year this restructuring plan did not involve any non cash components 

table of contents the following table sets forth changes in our restructuring liability during fiscal year in connection with this plan employee related facilities related total in thousands balance at october  charges to expense cash payments balance at october  also during fiscal year  we committed to a separate plan to reorganize our scientific instruments and corporate marketing organizations and to consolidate certain scientific instruments administrative functions in north america 
this plan  which involved the termination of approximately employees  was undertaken to more closely align the strategic and operational focus of these organizations across different product lines and to improve efficiency and reduce operating costs 
these actions were initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and were completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year all severance and other employee related costs relating to this restructuring plan were initially recorded and included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year this restructuring plan did not involve any non cash components 
the following table sets forth changes in our restructuring liability during fiscal year in connection with this plan employee related facilities related total in thousands balance at october  charges to expense balance at october  fiscal year plan 
during fiscal year  we undertook certain restructuring actions to improve efficiency and more closely align employee skill sets and other resources with our evolving product mix as a result of our continued emphasis on nmr  mass spectroscopy and consumable products  with a bias toward life science applications 
in addition  actions were undertaken to create a more efficient consumable products operation 
these actions primarily impacted the scientific instruments segment and involved the termination of approximately employees principally in our sales and marketing  administration  service and manufacturing functions  the closure of three sales offices and the consolidation of three consumable products factories into one in southern california 
substantially all of these activities were completed during fiscal year except for the termination of approximately employees  which took place in the second and third quarters of fiscal year and the southern california facility consolidation  which was initiated in the third quarter of fiscal year and was substantially completed in the first quarter of fiscal year costs relating to these restructuring activities have been included in selling  general and administrative expenses 

table of contents the following table sets forth changes in our restructuring liability during fiscal year in connection with this plan employee related facilities related total in thousands balance at october  charges to expense  net cash payments foreign currency impacts and other adjustments balance at october  during fiscal year  we incurred approximately million in other costs relating directly to the southern california facility consolidation that were in addition to the restructuring costs described above 
these costs included approximately million of non cash charges for accelerated depreciation of assets to be disposed of upon the closure of facilities  approximately million in facility relocation costs and approximately million in employee retention and relocation costs 
purchased in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of the digilab business in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a one time pretax charge of million for purchased in process research and development relating to several new digilab business products that were in process at the time of the acquisition 
no such charges were recorded during fiscal year interest income 
the increase in interest income in fiscal year resulted primarily from higher levels of invested cash and some increase in interest rates on invested cash 
income tax expense 
the effective income tax rate was for fiscal year  compared to for fiscal year earnings from continuing operations 
earnings from continuing operations in fiscal year reflect the impact of approximately million in pretax restructuring and other related costs  approximately million in amortization expense relating to acquisition related intangible assets and a pretax gain of approximately million relating to the curtailment of two defined benefit pension plans 
earnings from continuing operations in fiscal year included approximately million in pretax restructuring costs  approximately million in amortization expense relating to acquisition related intangible assets and a pretax patent suit settlement of million 
excluding the impact of these items  the increase in net earnings resulted primarily from increased sales volume 
earnings from discontinued operations 
earnings from discontinued operations include earnings from the operations of the disposed electronics manufacturing business 
during fiscal year  we recorded approximately million in earnings generated by the operations of the disposed business net of tax 
earnings generated by the operations of the disposed business were approximately million net of tax in fiscal year critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to exercise certain judgments in selecting and applying accounting policies and methods 
the following is a summary of what we consider to be our most critical accounting policies those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments the effects of those accounting policies applied and the judgments made in their application 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we derive revenues from product sales including accessory sales and services 
we recognize revenue on product sales and accessory sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the product or accessory has been delivered  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
our sales are typically not subject to rights of return and  historically  actual sales returns have not been significant 
product sales that do not involve unique customer acceptance terms or new specifications or technology with customer acceptance provisions  but that do involve installation services  are accounted for as multiple element arrangements  where the larger of the contractual billing holdback or the fair value of the installation service is deferred when the product is delivered and subsequently recognized when the installation is complete 
for certain other product sales that do involve unique customer acceptance terms or new specifications or technology with customer acceptance provisions  all revenue is deferred until all contractually required customer acceptance provisions and product specifications have been satisfied 
revenue related to service contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contracts 
unearned maintenance and service contract revenue is included in accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
revenue related to incident based paid service and training services is recognized when the related services are provided to the customer 
in all cases  the fair value of undelivered elements is deferred until those items are delivered to the customer 
sales arrangements involving undelivered elements are primarily confined to the scientific instruments segment and involve product accessories  installation services and or training services that are delivered after the related product has been delivered 
product accessories generally enhance the functionality of the product but are not essential to the functionality of the product 
in determining relative fair values for product accessories and training services  we utilize published price list values as the basis for allocating the overall arrangement consideration 
list prices are representative of fair value  as stand alone sales of products  product accessories and training have occurred at list price 
the fair value of installation services is calculated by applying standard service billing rates to the estimate of the number of hours to install a specific product based on historical experience 
estimates of installation hours have historically been accurate 
in limited cases  product accessories ordered by customers may not have an established list price  as the item may be a new or slightly modified accessory with no prior sales history 
in these limited cases  we consider whether a comparable or substitute accessory that provides similar functionality exists for which fair value has been established and then use that comparable or substitute accessory s list price in estimating the fair value of the undelivered elements 
if such conditions do not exist  all arrangement revenue is deferred until the undelivered element is delivered  however  such cases are infrequent and arise from a significant technological advance that creates products or product accessories without a suitable comparable or substitute accessory from which to derive fair value 
we determine when and how much revenue may be recognized on a particular transaction in a particular period based on our best estimates of the fair value of undelivered elements and our judgment of when our performance obligations have been met as outlined above 
these judgments and estimates impact reported revenues 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable 
we sell our products and extend trade credit to a large number of customers 
these customers are dispersed across many different industries and geographies and  historically  no single customer has accounted for or more of our total revenues or trade accounts receivable 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral from them 
although bad debt write offs have historically been insignificant  allowances are established for amounts that are considered to be uncollectible 
these allowances represent our best estimates and are based on our judgment after considering a number of factors including third party credit reports  actual payment history  customer specific financial information and broader market and economic trends and conditions 
in the event that actual uncollectible amounts differ from these best estimates  changes in allowances for doubtful accounts might become necessary 

table of contents inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being computed on an average cost basis 
provisions are made to write down potentially excess  obsolete or slow moving inventories to their net realizable value 
these provisions are based on our best estimates after considering historical demand  projected future demand including current backlog  inventory purchase commitments  industry and market trends and conditions and other factors 
in the event that actual excess  obsolete or slow moving inventories differ from these best estimates  changes to inventory reserves might become necessary 
product warranty 
our products are generally subject to warranties and liabilities are therefore established for the estimated future costs of repair or replacement through charges to cost of sales at the time the related sale is recognized 
these liabilities are adjusted based on our best estimates of future warranty costs after considering historical and projected product failure rates and product repair costs 
in the event that actual experience differs from these best estimates  changes in our warranty liabilities might become necessary 
environmental liabilities 
as discussed more fully in item business and item a risk factors environmental matters  we entered into a distribution agreement in connection with becoming a separate  public company on april  under the terms of that distribution agreement  we are obligated to indemnify varian medical systems  inc vms for one third of certain environmental investigation  monitoring and or remediation costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by vms for such costs 
the liabilities recorded by us relating to these matters are based on our best estimates after considering currently available information regarding the cost and timing of remediation efforts  related legal matters  insurance recoveries and other environmental related events 
as additional information becomes available  these amounts are adjusted accordingly 
should the cost or timing of remediation efforts  legal matters  insurance recoveries or other environmental related events including any which may be currently unidentified differ from our current expectations and best estimates  changes to our reserves for environmental matters might become necessary 
income taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous jurisdictions outside of the us significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our income tax expense 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on our best estimates of whether and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
these reserves are established when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
these reserves are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances 
our income tax expense includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate 
should the ultimate resolution of any tax related uncertainties including any which may be currently identified differ from our current expectations  charges or credits to our income tax reserves and income tax expense will become necessary 
liquidity and capital resources we generated million of cash from operating activities in fiscal year  which compares to million generated in fiscal year cash from operating activities provided by discontinued operations comprised million and million for fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
excluding the effect of the disposition of our electronics manufacturing business  cash from operating activities remained flat 
the relative decrease in accrued liabilities million  which was driven by the higher income tax payments and the conversion of several significant customer advances in connection with sales recorded during fiscal year  was offset by changes in other working capital  including relative decreases in accounts receivable million and inventories million 
these decreases were primarily attributable to stronger cash collections and improved inventory management during fiscal year 
table of contents we generated million of cash from investing activities in fiscal year  which compares to million used for investing activities in fiscal year this relative increase of million in cash generated from investing activities was primarily due to the receipt of million in net proceeds from the sale of the electronics manufacturing business in fiscal year we also generated million in cash from the sale of short term investments  net of purchases in fiscal year  which compares to million in cash used for purchases of short term investments in fiscal year we used million for acquisition related payments in fiscal year  which compares to million used in fiscal year payments made in fiscal year primarily related to the acquisitions of magnex and the digilab business  while payments in fiscal year primarily related to the digilab business 
we used million of cash for financing activities in fiscal year  which compares to million used for financing activities in fiscal year the increase in cash used for financing activities was primarily due to increased expenditures to repurchase and retire common stock 
we used million to repurchase common stock in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year the increased level of stock repurchases in fiscal year was the result of an effort to utilize excess cash  particularly the net proceeds from the sale of the electronics manufacturing business  to reduce the number of outstanding common shares 
in addition  compared to fiscal year  we generated lower proceeds from the issuance of common stock due to lower stock option exercise volume and made larger debt repayments due to the repayment of a long term note payable during fiscal year as of september   we had a total of million in uncommitted and unsecured credit facilities for working capital purposes with interest rates to be established at the time of borrowing 
no borrowings were outstanding under these credit facilities as of september  of the million in uncommitted and unsecured credit facilities  a total of million was limited for use by  or in favor of  certain subsidiaries at september   and a total of million of this million was being utilized in the form of bank guarantees and short term standby letters of credit 
these guarantees and letters of credit related primarily to advance payments and deposits made to our subsidiaries by customers for which separate liabilities were recorded in the consolidated financial statements at september  no amounts had been drawn by beneficiaries under these or any other outstanding guarantees or letters of credit as of that date 
as of september   we had million in term loans outstanding  compared to million at october  as of both september  and october   fixed interest rates on the term loans ranged from to 
the weighted average interest rate on the term loans was at both september  and october  the term loans contain certain covenants that limit future borrowings and the payment of cash dividends and require the maintenance of certain levels of working capital and operating results 
we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants of the term loan agreements at september  at october   we had other long term notes payable of million with a weighted average interest rate of 
during fiscal year  we paid the outstanding balance on this long term note in advance of a significant scheduled increase in the applicable interest rate 

table of contents in connection with the magnex and digilab business acquisitions  we have accrued but not yet paid a portion of the purchase price amounts that have been retained to secure the sellers indemnification obligations 
as of september   retained amounts for the magnex acquisition included million relating to the sellers indemnification obligations  which is due to be paid or received in the form of notes payable by us at the sellers elections in two equal installments net of any indemnification claims on the first and second anniversaries of the closing of that acquisition  which occurred in november of this amount  million was paid during the first quarter of fiscal year the retained amount for the digilab business acquisition  which was also paid during the first quarter of fiscal year  totaled approximately million at september  in addition to these retained payments  we are  from time to time  obligated to pay additional cash purchase price amounts in the event that certain financial or operational milestones are met by acquired businesses 
during fiscal year  we accrued a contingent payment and recorded additional goodwill of approximately million based on the financial performance of the digilab business through september this amount was paid in the first quarter of fiscal year as of september   up to a maximum of approximately million could be payable through fiscal year under other contingent consideration arrangements 
of this maximum amount  a total of million relates to the magnex acquisition and can be earned over a three year period ending in november  depending on the performance of the magnex business relative to certain financial targets 
the balance of approximately million relates to the acquisition of bear instruments  inc in fiscal year and can be earned if acquired product lines reach specific financial performance targets through march the distribution agreement provides that we are responsible for certain litigation to which vai was a party and further provides that we will indemnify vms and vsea for one third of the costs  expenses and other liabilities relating to certain discontinued  former and corporate operations of vai  including certain environmental liabilities see under item a risk factors environmental matters and governmental regulations 
we had no material cancelable or non cancelable commitments for capital expenditures as of september  in the aggregate  we currently anticipate that our capital expenditures will be between million and million during fiscal year on november   our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to utilize up to million to repurchase shares of our common stock 
this repurchase program is effective until september  our liquidity is affected by many other factors  some based on the normal ongoing operations of the business and others related to the uncertainties of the industry in which we compete and global economies 
although our cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors  we believe that cash generated from operations  together with our current cash balance and borrowing capability  will be sufficient to satisfy commitments for capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the next months 

table of contents contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following table summarizes the amount and estimated timing of future cash expenditures relating to principal payments on outstanding debt  minimum rentals due for certain facilities and other leased assets under long term  non cancelable operating leases  and minimum purchase commitments net of deposits paid under long term  non cancelable vendor agreements as of september  fiscal years thereafter total in thousands operating leases long term debt including current portion purchase obligations  net of deposits paid total contractual cash obligations in addition to the non cancelable contractual obligations included in the above table  we had cancelable commitments to purchase certain superconducting magnets intended for use with nmr systems totaling approximately million  net of deposits paid  as of september  in the event that these commitments are canceled for reasons other than the supplier s default  we may be responsible for reimbursement of certain costs incurred by the supplier 
as of september   we did not have any off balance sheet commercial commitments that could result in a significant cash outflow upon the occurrence of some contingent event  except for contingent payments of up to a maximum of million related to acquisitions as discussed under liquidity and capital resources above  the specific amounts of which are not currently determinable 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a proposed amendment to sfas  earnings per share  to make it consistent with international accounting standard  earnings per share  so as to make earnings per share computations comparable on a global basis 
as currently drafted  the amendment would require companies to use the year to date average stock price to compute the number of treasury shares that could theoretically be purchased with the proceeds from exercise of share contracts such as options or warrants 
the current method of calculating earnings per share requires companies to calculate an average of the potential incremental common shares computed for each quarter when computing year to date incremental shares 
the proposed amendment would also change other aspects of sfas that would not impact our earnings per share calculations 
the proposed amendment is currently expected to be effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  and  once effective  will require retrospective application for all prior periods presented 
if the proposed amendment is finalized in its current form including the proposed effective date  its adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued sfas  inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter the amendments made by sfas clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the guidance is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas r  which addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of that company or liabilities that are based on the fair value of that company s equity instruments  or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the standard eliminates companies ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expense in our consolidated statement of earnings 
under sfas r  we are required to determine an appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
in addition  the adoption of sfas r will require additional accounting related to the tax benefit on share based payments made under our omnibus stock plan and employee stock purchase plan 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as cash flows from financing activities  rather than as cash flows from operating activities 
in march  the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  share based payment  which provides interpretive guidance relating to the application of sfas r 
the guidance contained in sab is intended to assist issuers in the initial implementation of sfas r and to enhance the information received by investors and other users of financial statements 
sab allows a flexible approach to the implementation of sfas r and provides issuers with latitude in measuring the value of employee stock options under the standard 
as amended by the sec in april  sfas r is now effective for the first quarter of our fiscal year we plan to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method  and anticipate using the black scholes model to determine the fair value of share based payments made under our omnibus stock plan and employee stock purchase plan 
because of the complexities involved in determining appropriate assumptions for use in the black scholes model  we are not yet able to accurately estimate the impact of adopting sfas r 
however  we expect this impact to be material to our results of operations and operating cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fsp  application of fasb  accounting for incomes taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of the act 
the act  which became law in october  provides for a special tax deduction on qualified domestic production activities income that is defined by the act 
the fasb has decided that these amounts should be recorded as a special deduction  and recorded in the year earned 
the adoption of fsp  which became effective when it was issued in december  did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements for changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
sfas further requires a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  non financial assets to be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued fsp  accounting for electronic equipment waste obligations 
fsp provides guidance on how companies should account for their obligations  if any  under european union eu directive ec on waste electrical and electronic equipment the weee directive with respect to the disposal of certain electrical and electronic equipment put onto the market in the eu prior to august  historical waste equipment and held by commercial users or private households 
in the case of historical waste equipment held by commercial users  the weee directive states that the disposal obligation remains with the commercial user unless the legislation implementing the weee directive adopted by the applicable eu member country provides for the transfer of the obligation back to the producer manufacturer or importer 
whichever is the responsible party the commercial user or the manufacturer importer must apply sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  in accounting under fsp for its disposal obligations 
in the case of historical waste equipment held by private households  the weee directive dictates that the disposal obligation must be borne collectively by equipment manufacturers and importers selling in the eu member country  with the method used to compute and allocate this obligation to be determined by each eu member country 
any such disposal obligations must be recognized  with an offsetting amount to expense  over the applicable measurement period 
fsp is effective the later of the first reporting period that ends after june  or the date that each eu member country adopts legislation implementing the weee directive 
as of september   most of the eu member countries had adopted legislation to implement the weee directive although in some cases to be effective at a future date  but a number of eu member countries had not 
with respect to those eu member countries that had implemented the weee directive as of september   we have adopted fsp and such adoption did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
with respect to those eu member countries that had not adopted legislation to implement the directive as of september   we do not expect the adoption of fsp to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies 
from time to time  we also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on forecasted transactions 
the success of our hedging activities depends on our ability to forecast balance sheet exposures and transaction activity in various foreign currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
however  we believe that in most cases any such gains or losses would be substantially offset by losses or gains from the related foreign exchange forward contracts 
we therefore believe that the direct effect of an immediate change in the exchange rate between the us dollar and all other currencies is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
at september   there were no outstanding forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions 
during the fiscal year ended september   no foreign exchange gains or losses from cash flow hedge ineffectiveness were recognized 

table of contents our foreign exchange forward contracts generally range from one to months in original maturity 
a summary of all foreign exchange forward contracts that were outstanding as of september  follows notional value sold notional value purchased in thousands euro british pound australian dollar canadian dollar japanese yen danish krone swiss franc total interest rate risk 
we have no material exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates 
we invest any excess cash primarily in short term us treasury securities and money market funds  and changes in interest rates would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
we enter into debt obligations principally to support general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and acquisitions 
at september   our debt obligations had fixed interest rates 
based upon rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities  the carrying amounts of long term debt and notes payable approximate their estimated fair values 
although payments under certain operating leases for our facilities are tied to market indices  we are not exposed to material interest rate risk associated with our operating leases 
debt obligations 
principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity fiscal years thereafter total dollars in thousands long term debt including current portion average interest rate defined benefit retirement plans 
most of our retirement plans  including all us based plans  are defined contribution plans 
however  we also provide defined benefit pension plans in certain countries outside of the us our obligations under these defined benefit plans will ultimately be settled in the future and are therefore subject to estimation 
defined benefit pension accounting under sfas  employers accounting for pensions  is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees estimated service periods based on the terms of the pension plans and the investment and funding decisions made by us 

table of contents for our defined benefit pension plans  we make assumptions regarding several variables including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate in order to determine defined benefit pension plan expense for the year 
this expense is referred to as net periodic pension cost 
we assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumption for each defined benefit plan based on relevant market conditions as prescribed by sfas and make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate 
on an annual basis  we analyze the rates of return on plan assets and discount rates used and determine that these rates are reasonable 
for rates of return  this analysis is based on a review of the nature of the underlying assets  the allocation of those assets and their historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where the related plans are effective 
historically  our assumed asset allocations have not varied significantly from the actual allocations 
discount rates are based on the prevailing market long term interest rates in the countries where the related plans are effective 
as of september   the estimated long term rate of return on our defined benefit pension plan assets ranged from to weighted average of  and the assumed discount rate for our defined benefit pension plan obligations ranged from to weighted average of 
if any of these assumptions were to change  our net periodic pension cost would also change 
we incurred net periodic pension cost relating to our defined benefit pension plans of million in fiscal year excluding a settlement loss  million in fiscal year excluding curtailment gains and million in fiscal year  and expect our net periodic pension cost to be approximately million in fiscal year a one percent decrease in the weighted average estimated return on plan assets or assumed discount rate would increase our net periodic pension cost for fiscal year by million or million  respectively 
as of september   our projected benefit obligation relating to defined benefit pension plans was million 
a one percent decrease in the weighted average estimated discount rate would increase this obligation by million 
during fiscal year  we ceased future benefit accruals to our existing defined benefit pension plans in australia and the netherlands and commenced contributions to new defined contribution plans for the benefit of their participants 
in connection with these actions  we recorded curtailment gains of approximately million during fiscal year these curtailment gains were offset by a related defined benefit plan settlement loss of approximately million in fiscal year
