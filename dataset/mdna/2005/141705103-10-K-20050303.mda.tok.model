item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of the following md a is to help facilitate an understanding of the significant factors influencing our historical operating results  financial condition and cash flows and also to convey management s expectations of the potential impact of known trends  events or uncertainties that may materially impact future results 
this md a contains forward looking statements as described on page i of this annual report on form k 
our md a should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
overview we are one of the largest pharmaceutical services companies in the united states 
on march   we completed our previously announced acquisition of advancepcs 
see item  business development of business for further information about this acquisition 
our pharmaceutical services are generally referred to as pharmacy benefit management  or pbm  services and involve the design and administration of programs aimed at reducing the costs and improving the safety  effectiveness and convenience of prescription drug use 
we generate our net revenue primarily from dispensing prescription drugs  either directly through our mail service pharmacies or indirectly through our network of third party retail pharmacies  and through providing certain other services  including disease management  health benefits management and data access to our customers  which are primarily employers  unions  government employee groups  insurance companies  managed care organizations and other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals throughout the united states 
our net revenue represents amounts earned from both our customers and the participants in our customers health benefit plans and includes copayments paid by participants both to us  for mail service prescriptions  and to the third party pharmacies in our retail network  for most retail prescriptions 
our net revenues reflect the effects of any discounts provided to our customers 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies revenue recognition to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k for detailed information concerning our revenue recognition policies 
we generate cost savings for our customers primarily by negotiating for the discounted purchase of pharmaceutical products dispensed to their participants 
we purchase pharmaceutical products from  and negotiate various forms of discounts from established list prices with  pharmaceutical manufacturers  pharmaceutical wholesalers and retail pharmacies 
when we purchase pharmaceutical products directly from their manufacturer  as is typically the case with generic and biotech products  we generally receive any negotiated discount at the time of purchase 
when we purchase pharmaceutical products indirectly eg through a wholesaler or from a retail pharmacy at the point of dispensing  as is typically the case with brand name  non biotech products  we generally receive a discount from the vendor and  in many cases  the product s manufacturer 
in these cases  the vendor discount is received at the time of purchase  however  the manufacturer discount is received after the product is dispensed 
our cost of revenues reflects the effects of these discounts 
the prices we have negotiated with our customers for the pharmaceutical products we dispense to their participants are generally based on contractual discounts from established list prices and may also include additional discounts based on the type ie preferred brand  non preferred brand  generic  etc 
of prescriptions filled 
the prices in our vendor contracts with various parties manufacturers  wholesalers  retail pharmacies  etc 
for the purchase of these pharmaceuticals are also based on discounts from established list prices plus  in many cases  additional discounts in the form of prompt payment terms and or rebates 
additionally  both our customer and vendor contracts typically contain clauses which would allow us to renegotiate pricing in the event that legislation or other events limiting or eliminating the various discounting practices in the pharmaceutical industry  including the practice of providing discounts in the form of rebates  were to occur 

index to financial statements we dispense prescription drugs on behalf of our customers through our seven large  automated mail service pharmacies and our smaller regional specialty pharmacies 
we also maintain a nationwide network composed of over  retail pharmacies with which we have contracted to purchase pharmaceuticals for immediate delivery to our customers participants 
critical accounting estimates income taxes 
we had total federal and state income tax net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards available to offset future taxable income of approximately million as of december  these nol carryforwards were primarily generated from losses incurred in our discontinued ppm business 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with these nol carryforwards if it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize them to offset future taxes 
due to the size of the nol carryforwards in relation to our history of unprofitable operations and to uncertainties surrounding our discontinued operations  we did not recognize any of this net deferred tax asset for financial reporting purposes until in the fourth quarter of  management concluded that it is more likely than not that we will realize a significant portion of the nol carryforwards 
upon reaching this conclusion  we recorded the estimated realizable value of the deferred tax asset and have provided for income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates  which approximated in  in and is expected to approximate in  rather than the rate previously used 
due to the complexity of our discontinued operations divestiture  the fact that nols can be audited well beyond a normal three year statutory audit period and the inherent uncertainty of estimates of future taxable income  the amount of the nols which may ultimately be utilized to offset future taxable income may vary materially from our estimates 
we have established a reserve for tax related contingencies based on our estimates of the amount of benefit from these nols that we may ultimately be unable to realize due to factors other than estimates of future taxable income 
subsequent revisions to the estimated realizable value of the net deferred tax asset or the reserve for nol related contingencies may cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although our cash tax payments will remain unaffected until the nols are utilized 
we expect to utilize the majority of the benefit of the nols in  excluding nols in certain states in which we do not expect to be able to utilize the nols prior to their expiration 
a valuation allowance related to these state nols of approximately million was included in our net deferred tax asset at december  estimates concerning contingencies 
generally accepted accounting principles specify the criteria for disclosing contingent losses and recording any related estimate of the loss amount 
these criteria are based on both probability assessments of the eventual outcome of the contingent event and on the availability of information necessary to estimate the amount of the loss 
if it is determined that i it is probable a material loss has been incurred and ii the amount of the loss can be reliably estimated  the nature of the loss should be disclosed  and an estimate of the loss should be recorded 
if it is reasonably possible that a material loss has been incurred  the nature of the possible loss should be disclosed along with an estimate of the amount of the loss if it is available 
to the extent that the incurrence of a material loss is judged remote  no disclosure is required 
the most significant contingencies to which we are exposed  other than the tax related contingencies discussed above  relate to damages sought by claimants under various lawsuits and investigations 
the specific cases for which we believe it may be at least reasonably possible that we have incurred a loss are discussed further at item  legal proceedings and in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements which appear beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
probability estimates related to the anticipated outcomes of lawsuits investigations and to the amounts of damages which may ultimately be awarded are inherently uncertain 
we have made our estimates based on all available facts and circumstances existing as of the date such estimates were made 
although these estimates 
index to financial statements have been made based on our prior experience with litigation investigations  our knowledge of the details of each case  and  in many cases  our consultation with external legal counsel  the actual outcome of pending litigation and investigations could differ materially from our estimates 
accounts receivable valuation allowances 
we are exposed to credit losses from accounts receivable that are recorded as assets in our financial statements but may ultimately be uncollectible and to adjustments to accounts receivable based on contractual interpretations and claims audits 
we perform detailed analysis of accounts receivable and related data on a monthly basis and have attempted to allow for expected adjustments based on our past experience with similar accounts receivable 
we believe our accounts receivable valuation allowances to be adequate  however  it is possible that the accuracy of our estimation process could be materially impacted as the composition of this pool of accounts receivable changes over time 
we continually review and refine our estimation processes to make them as reactive to these changes as possible  however  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accurately estimate the amounts of these accounts receivable that will ultimately be collected 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies or estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear beginning on page f of this annual report on form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
factors that may affect future results our future operating results and financial condition are dependent on our ability to market our services profitably  which is  in turn  heavily dependent on our ability to successfully negotiate discounts for pharmaceutical purchases at various points in our supply chain  and to successfully increase market share and manage expense growth relative to revenue growth 
our future operating results and financial condition may be affected by a number of additional factors  including  but not limited to i identification of  and competition for  growth and expansion opportunities  ii our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers  iii declining reimbursement levels for  or increases in the costs of  products dispensed  iv exposure to liabilities in excess of our insurance  v compliance with  or changes in  government regulation  including pharmacy licensing requirements and healthcare reform legislation  vi adverse developments in any investigation related to the pharmaceutical industry that may be conducted by governmental authorities  vii adverse resolution of existing or future lawsuits or investigations  viii our ability to successfully integrate advancepcs  ix liquidity and capital requirements and x our ability to successfully terminate leases and other contractual agreements related to our discontinued operations and the outcome of various legal disputes surrounding our discontinued ppm business 
changes in one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results and financial condition 
there are various legal matters which  if adversely determined  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition

these amounts are included in total depreciation for each period 
operating income equals net revenue less cost of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses  depreciation  amortization of intangible assets  stock option expense and integration and other related expenses 
operating income is computed in accordance with sec rules  however  it is subject to the same limitations as our presentation of ebitda as described at below 
we believe that ebitda  which is a non gaap financial measure  is a supplemental measurement tool used by analysts and investors to help evaluate a company s overall operating performance  its ability to incur and service debt and its capacity for making capital expenditures 
we use ebitda  in addition to operating income and cash flows from operating activities  to assess our liquidity and performance and believe that it is important for investors to be able to evaluate our company using the same measures used by our management 
ebitda can be reconciled to net cash provided by continuing operations  which we believe to be the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap  as follows in thousands year ended december  income from continuing operations depreciation and amortization interest expense  net provision for benefit from income taxes ebitda cash interest payments  net of interest income cash tax payments  net of refunds other non cash expenses other changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of acquisitions disposals of businesses net cash provided by continuing operations ebitda does not represent funds available for our discretionary use and is not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for net income or cash flow from operations data as measured under gaap

index to financial statements pro forma operating results the following table sets forth selected pro forma information about our results of continuing operations for the years ended december  and this pro forma information was prepared as if the advancepcs acquisition had been consummated at the beginning of each respective period 
additional information concerning the pro forma presentation appears in note  acquisitions of businesses  to our audited consolidated financial statements which appear beginning on page f of this annual report on form k

the results of operations of advancepcs for the period march  through december   are included in our statement of income for the year ended december  the primary factor influencing the comparison of our results of operations for compared to was the advancepcs acquisition 
net revenue 
net revenue increased by approximately billion to approximately billion in the year ended december   from approximately billion in on a pro forma basis  net revenue 
index to financial statements increased by approximately billion  or  to approximately billion in the year ended december   from approximately billion in pro forma revenues for the year ended december   were reduced by approximately billion from amounts recorded in the same period in due to the previously announced renewal of a large contract and a corresponding change in revenue recognition for this contract from a gross basis to a net basis 
this accounting change had no impact on net income 
pro forma revenue growth was also reduced by a higher dispensing rate of generic drugs that have lower prices but result in healthcare cost savings for our customers 
excluding the impact of higher generic dispensing rates  pro forma revenues for the year ended december   would have increased approximately over the pro forma amount  reflecting drug cost inflation and net new business in on a pro forma basis  revenues from mail service claims increased approximately billion  or  to approximately billion in from approximately billion in this increase results from an increase in mail service claim volume of approximately and an increase in average revenue per mail service claim of approximately 
the mail service claim volume increases are related to increases from both new customers and the percentage of mail service claims adjusted for differences in average days supply to total pharmacy claims  referred to as our mail penetration rate 
on a pro forma basis  our mail penetration rate was approximately in  compared to a mail penetration rate of in the increase in average revenue per mail service claim reflects increases in the prices of products dispensed as well as a slight change in overall mix towards higher priced specialty pharmaceutical products offset by the effects of higher generic dispensing rates as described above 
on a pro forma basis  our mail service generic dispensing rate was in  compared to a mail service generic dispensing rate of in on a pro forma basis  revenues from retail claims increased approximately million  or  to approximately billion in from approximately billion in this increase results from an increase in retail claim volume of approximately and an increase in average revenue per retail claim of approximately 
the retail claim volume increases are related to increases from new customers offset by the mail penetration rate increase referred to above 
the increase in average revenue per retail claim reflects increases in the prices of products dispensed offset by the effects of higher generic dispensing rates and the contract change described above 
on a pro forma basis  our retail generic dispensing rate was in  compared to a retail generic dispensing rate of in cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased approximately billion to approximately billion in the year ended december   from approximately billion in on a pro forma basis  drug ingredient costs increased approximately billion  or  to approximately billion in from approximately billion in this increase results from an increase in total claim volume of approximately and an increase in average drug ingredient cost per claim of approximately 
the total claim volume increases are related primarily to increases from new customers 
the increase in average drug ingredient cost per claim reflects increases in the prices of products dispensed as well as a slight change in overall mix towards higher priced specialty pharmaceutical products offset by the effects of higher generic dispensing rates and the contract change described above 
generic drugs have lower prices but result in healthcare cost savings for our customers and generally a higher gross profit margin for the company 
pro forma cost of revenues for the year ended december   were reduced by approximately billion from amounts recorded in the same period in due to the contract change referred to above 
the rate of increase in pro forma drug ingredient costs was also favorably impacted by economies of scale achieved through the combined purchasing efficiency of caremark and advancepcs 
pharmacy operating costs and other costs of revenues increased by approximately million  or  on a pro forma basis to approximately million in from approximately million in this increase relates primarily to additional customer service center and pharmacy costs incurred to service the overall increases in call volumes and mail service claims in from levels experienced in pharmacy operating costs and other costs of revenues decreased as a percentage of revenue to in from in the decrease in pharmacy operating costs and other costs of revenues in relation to revenues primarily reflects the realization of efficiency increases in our mail service pharmacies and customer service centers gained from 
index to financial statements capacity additions and technological enhancements made through a significant component of the increase in depreciation expense described below relates to capital assets purchased in conjunction with these capacity additions and technological enhancements 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased on an absolute basis in  due primarily to the advancepcs acquisition 
on a pro forma basis  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by on an absolute basis 
however  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenue  to from  reflecting primarily the impact of the cost reductions achieved to date from the advancepcs acquisition 
depreciation 
depreciation increased in due primarily to the advancepcs acquisition 
depreciation increased in on a pro forma basis due primarily to the amounts and timing of depreciation related to capital expenditures made to increase capacities in our mail service pharmacies 
depreciation expense is expected to total approximately million in amortization of intangible assets 
the amortization of intangible assets recorded in was related entirely to the intangible assets acquired from advancepcs 
amortization of intangible assets is expected to total approximately million in interest expense  net 
the decrease in net interest expense in resulted primarily from reductions in the amount of outstanding indebtedness under our credit agreements and increased interest income generated by cash on hand and short term investments 
net interest expense is expected to total approximately million to million in  including the impact of the repayment of our million term loan and million of advancepcs senior notes 
stock option expense 
the stock option expense recorded in relates to the intrinsic value of unvested stock options held by advancepcs optionees on the date of the advancepcs acquisition 
we issued replacement stock options to these optionees with vesting terms identical to their original stock options 
the intrinsic value amount related to the unvested portion of these replacement stock options will be recognized as an expense in future periods 
the amount to be expensed will change from the remaining unvested intrinsic value to the remaining unvested fair value as determined on the date of the advancepcs acquisition no later than the quarterly period beginning july   due to our adoption of fas r as defined 
additionally  the fair value of all other outstanding  unvested stock options will begin to be expensed over the remaining vesting periods of the underlying options upon our adoption of fas r 
presuming that we adopt fas r effective july   we expect stock option expense to total approximately million in this estimate excludes the impact of any stock option grants which may be made in integration and other related expenses 
we incurred approximately million of expenses for the year ended december   consisting primarily of approximately million for involuntary termination benefits  a writeoff of approximately million of deferred loan costs for indebtedness retired in conjunction with the closing of the advancepcs acquisition  approximately million of integration planning activities related to the advancepcs acquisition and approximately million related to retention benefit obligations under the advancepcs retention plan 
the balance of the costs incurred in relate primarily to payments to outside service vendors used for various integration related projects 
costs incurred in consisted primarily of pre acquisition integration planning activities with respect to the advancepcs acquisition and relocation expenses for moving our corporate headquarters to nashville  tennessee 
provision for income taxes 
as a result of the advancepcs acquisition  our provision for income taxes was recorded using a effective tax rate on book income beginning in the second quarter of compared to the effective tax rate on book income in and the first quarter of 
index to financial statements results of continuing operations for compared to net revenue 
net revenue increased by approximately billion to approximately billion in from approximately billion in increases in sales volumes  resulting primarily from net new customer additions and increases in the utilization of products  accounted for approximately billion  or  of the total increase in net revenue 
net revenue per prescription increases  primarily from drug cost inflation offset by increased generic utilization  accounted for an additional amount of approximately million  or of the increase in net revenue 
we estimate that increases in generic dispensing rates lowered the amount of drug cost inflation referred to above by approximately million during our other revenues presented in the preceding table are composed primarily of amounts billed for disease management services and for sales of de identified pharmaceutical data 
we recorded approximately million of data sales revenue in  compared to approximately million in  and this million decrease was mostly offset by an increase of approximately million in disease management revenues 
cost of revenues 
drug ingredient costs increased approximately billion to approximately billion in from approximately billion in volume increases  resulting primarily from net new customer additions and increases in the utilization of products  represented approximately billion  or  of this increase 
increases in drug ingredient costs per prescription  primarily from drug cost inflation  resulted in approximately million  or of the increase 
the rate of increase in drug ingredient costs per prescription was slightly higher than the rate of increase in net product sales revenue per prescription due to changes in the mix of mail and retail dispensing rates 
pharmacy operating costs and other costs of revenue increased in this increase corresponds primarily to increases in pharmacy operating costs necessary to service the increase in the volume of mail service pharmacy claims  coupled with expenses incurred for capacity additions to our mail service pharmacies made necessary by this growth 
although these expenses increased on an absolute basis  they decreased as a percent of net revenue  from in to in  due to our continued focus on gaining efficiencies through economies of scale and productivity improvements 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased on an absolute basis in to support the overall growth in our business and were partially offset by a reduction in the rate applied to revenue for allowances for credit losses due to favorable accounts receivable collection experience during selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenue reflecting our continued focus on leveraging our existing infrastructure to grow our business 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased in due primarily to the amounts and timing of depreciation related to capital expenditures made to increase capacities in our mail service pharmacies primarily completion of our arizona pharmacy and expansion of our texas pharmacy and our call centers 
interest expense  net 
the decrease in net interest expense in resulted primarily from increased interest income generated by cash on hand 
integration and other related expenses 
we recorded approximately million of expenses in related to integration planning activities with respect to the advancepcs acquisition and relocation expenses for moving our corporate headquarters to nashville  tennessee 
the amounts recorded for integration planning activities relate primarily to consulting expenses and other incremental direct costs incurred in the process of preparing for the closing of the advancepcs acquisition 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in was recorded at a effective tax rate  which approximates the effective federal and state income tax rate applicable to our consolidated income 
in  we recognized a benefit from income taxes of approximately million associated with the elimination of the valuation allowance previously applied to our net deferred income tax asset 

index to financial statements results of discontinued operations during the year ended december   we recorded a charge of approximately million  excluding related income tax benefits  for revised estimates of exit costs related to our discontinued ppm operations based on additional information from that existing in  when we recorded a similar charge 
the charge consisted of adjustments to accruals for potential future obligations primarily related to leases  triggered by changes in the commercial real estate market  and legal expenses  triggered by the progress of various litigation and or arbitration cases 
these amounts are estimates  and actual costs could differ from those recorded 
historical liquidity and capital resources general 
we broadly define liquidity as our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow to meet our obligations and commitments 
in addition  liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing to meet our business objectives 
therefore  liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist of current or potentially available funds for use in achieving business objectives and meeting debt service commitments 
the following tables set forth selected information concerning our liquidity and capital resources and changes therein at and for the year ended december  dollars in millions net cash and cash equivalents provided by used in continuing operations investing activities financing activities discontinued operations net increase in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended december  cash and cash equivalents december  cash and cash equivalents december  december  december  net working capital long term debt fixed rate debt variable rate debt availability under revolving credit facility working capital equals total current assets minus total current liabilities 
reflects the repayment of our million term loan on february   and our intent to repurchase the remaining million of advancepcs senior notes for of face value on april  cash flows from continuing operations 
our performance relative to net cash provided by continuing operations for the year ended december   resulted from factors discussed above related to income from continuing operations coupled with focused management of working capital 
for the year ended december   our cash flows from continuing operations were positively impacted by a change in working capital of million 
significant components of this change included a reduction in excess of million in advancepcs s accounts receivable subsequent to the advancepcs acquisition related primarily to collection of contractual discounts from pharmaceutical manufacturers  a refund of approximately million received for estimated income taxes paid by advancepcs prior to the advancepcs acquisition  and a favorable impact from 
index to financial statements the transition of advancepcs s mail order pharmacies to caremark s wholesaler agreement 
our cash flows from continuing operations also benefited from the utilization of nols in  as well as in prior years 
the majority of these nols are expected to be fully utilized during  and our cash flows from continuing operations will be adversely impacted in and future periods due to the corresponding increase in cash payments for income taxes 
we do not expect changes in working capital to have a significant favorable impact to cash flow from operations in  and the impact of changes in working capital may be negative due to the utilization of our nols noted above as well as additional factors  including  but not limited to  differences in the timing of certain payments expected to occur in related to transactions that generated cash receipts in when compared to the effect of similar transactions from to  primarily related to the advancepcs acquisition 
for many of the customer contracts we assumed in the advancepcs acquisition  discount payments to customers are based on the discounts that we have collected from pharmaceutical manufacturers 
accordingly  during the first half of  we anticipate a cash outflow related to payment of these customers portions of manufacturer discounts that were collected in as discussed above 
in addition  cash flow from operations will be negatively impacted during the first half of due to the termination of certain client contracts which had significant levels of retail claims 
the net decrease in working capital from december   to december   is due primarily to our use of cash on hand to fund the advancepcs acquisition and related transactions coupled with the acquired working capital deficiency of advancepcs and the purchase of treasury stock referred to below 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash flows from investing activities for the year ended december   include million paid for the advancepcs acquisition net of cash acquired  million invested in short term investments and million of capital expenditures  offset by proceeds of approximately million from the sale of certain assets acquired in the advancepcs acquisition and million received from the partial liquidation of our investment in a private company that was formerly one of our subsidiaries 
cash flows from financing activities 
on march   in conjunction with the advancepcs acquisition  we restructured our indebtedness as follows our then existing million credit facility  consisting of a million term loan facility and a million revolving credit facility  was retired 
we paid off the balance of the term loan facility  approximately million 
no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility  our then existing million trade receivables sales facility  under which no amounts were outstanding  was terminated  we entered into a new million bank credit facility  consisting of a million term loan facility and a million revolving credit facility 
we borrowed million under the term loan facility on march   and principal payments of million per quarter began in june no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility excluding reductions in availability of approximately million for letters of credit at december   and we entered into a new million receivables backed credit facility  which is similar to our former trade receivables sales facility but is structured as indebtedness rather than as a sale of the accounts receivable 
no amounts were outstanding under the receivables backed credit facility at december  the receivables backed credit facility expires in march we also received net proceeds of approximately million from issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans  including exercises of stock options  and approximately million of proceeds from exercise of a warrant to purchase our common stock 
these proceeds were offset by our payments of approximately million to repurchase advancepcs senior notes in a tender offer and consent 
index to financial statements solicitation commenced in conjunction with the advancepcs acquisition  approximately million to repurchase million shares of our common stock under our publicly announced stock repurchase plan  approximately million of expenses to register and issue the common stock used for the advancepcs acquisition and approximately million of costs associated with the restructuring of indebtedness described above 
cash flows from discontinued operations 
in addition to the amounts paid through december   to service liabilities which arose from our discontinued ppm operations  we have accrued approximately million of remaining net liabilities related to our discontinued operations 
these amounts are estimates  and actual amounts could differ from those recorded 
credit facility 
we have a million credit facility with bank of america  na as administrative agent which consists of a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan facility maturing in march on february   we repaid the million then outstanding under the term loan facility 
at december   borrowings under the credit facility bore interest at variable rates based on the london inter bank offered rate libor  plus varying margins and consisted of outstanding term loans of million

the indenture for the senior notes also contains restrictions on indebtedness secured by liens 
to comply with this covenant  we have secured the senior notes on an equal and ratable basis with the credit facility 
advancepcs senior notes 
the million of advancepcs senior notes consist of notes which remained outstanding subsequent to the tender offer and consent solicitation described above 
we intend to repurchase these notes  pursuant to the terms of their indenture  at of face value on april outlook liquidity and capital resources overview 
currently  our liquidity needs arise primarily from i commitments related to financing obtained through the issuance of long term debt  ii working capital requirements iii capital expenditures and iv funding discontinued operations including the funding of any retained liabilities 
additionally  subject to certain restrictions in our credit facility  we have acquired businesses  and may continue to acquire additional businesses in the future  and could fund any such acquisition using cash on hand and short term investments  availability under our receivables backed credit facility or our 
index to financial statements revolving credit facility  or a combination thereof 
we believe that our cash on hand  short term investments  cash flows from operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future

under internal revenue code section  there is an annual limitation on the use of nols acquired from advancepcs 
if not utilized to offset future taxable income  over of the cumulative nol carryforward amount will expire from through we also had approximately million of tax effected state nols and other state income tax benefits  approximately million of which were acquired in the advancepcs acquisition 
we have placed a valuation allowance of approximately million on these state nols due to uncertainties as to whether we will be able to utilize the nols in certain states 
if not utilized to offset future taxable income  these state nols will expire on various dates through  with approximately expiring between and in addition to these nol carryforwards  we had approximately million of future additional income tax deductions related to our discontinued operations 
we also had a federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately million  which may be used to offset its ordinary federal corporate income taxes in the future 
we currently expect to utilize the majority of the benefit of our nol and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards in the second half of after these carryforwards are fully utilized  the amount of cash taxes we pay as a percentage of pretax income will increase significantly 
under fas we are required to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset for the future tax benefits of tax loss and tax credit carryforwards  as well as for other temporary differences  if it is more likely than not that we will not be able to generate future taxable income sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset to offset future taxes 
in years prior to  management believed this to be the case  and  accordingly  fully reserved our net deferred income tax asset 
during the fourth quarter of  management determined that  based on our historical operating performance and on our reasonably expected future performance  we no longer met this more likely than not criteria  and  accordingly reduced the valuation allowance

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
entitled share based payment fas r 
fas r requires companies to recognize the grant date fair value of stock options as an expense in their financial statements  as opposed to the footnote only pro forma disclosure requirements contained in fas companies may continue the fas pro forma disclosures through the required effective date of adoption of fas r  which will be no later than july   for us 
under the transition provisions of fas r  options currently being reflected in the fas pro forma disclosures will be expensed over their remaining vesting periods as of the date of adoption of fas r using the valuation assumptions and methods previously used to prepare the pro forma disclosures 
the estimated grant 
index to financial statements date fair value of any new stock option grants made after fas r is adopted will be expensed over the vesting periods of the underlying stock option 
fas r does not require the use of a particular option pricing model  and we are currently evaluating the various models that we may use to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options upon adoption of fas r 
additionally  fas r changes the accounting for many equity instruments other than stock options that may be issued to employees under our various benefit plans 
a portion of future grants under our employee stock purchase plan  as currently structured  would result in compensation expense after adoption of fas r  and instruments such as the restricted stock or stock units which may be issued under our stock incentive plan would be impacted as well 
we estimate that the adoption of fas r at july   would result in additional stock option expense of approximately million over the million which was expected to be expensed in under previous accounting rules 
this estimate excludes consideration of any expenses related to the employee stock purchase plan  which are expected to be insignificant  and the impact of any stock option grants which may be made in fas r also changes the statement of cash flows classification of tax benefits received for the amount of income tax deductions taken for option exercises in excess of amounts expensed thereunder 
these amounts are currently classified in cash flows from operating activities  however  they will be classified as cash flows from financing activities after adoption of fas r 
the payroll taxes we pay related to stock option exercises will remain classified as cash flows from operating activities 
we do not expect the adoption of fas r in to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates related to debt outstanding under our credit facility and for the discount on revolving sales of accounts receivable under our trade receivables sales facility 
our earnings and the fair value of our fixed rate debt are subject to change as a result of movements in market interest rates 
at december   we had million of obligations which were subject to variable rates of interest  including million outstanding under our term loan facility  which was repaid on february  a hypothetical increase in interest rates of from the rate at december   would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately million  presuming that obligations subject to variable interest rates remained constant 
the impact of such a change on the carrying value of long term debt would not be significant 
these amounts are determined based on only the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our outstanding obligations and do not consider the effects  if any  of the potential changes in the overall level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment
