item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary after two decades of rapid growth  the broiler industry is maturing and will be dependent on new and value added product development  as well as expanded export opportunities  for continued revenue growth 
production and operating efficiencies will also be necessary for increased profitability 
in addition  the industry is undergoing consolidation as a number of acquisitions and mergers have occurred in the last five years 
the market share of the top five us firms in terms of ready to cook broiler meat production has increased from approximately in to in and this trend is expected to continue 
gold kist is the third largest producer of broilers and related products accounting for approximately of the industry s production in calendar we experienced our two best years in history in fiscal and fiscal in terms of operating income  net income  liquidity and financial condition 
we are focusing our growth efforts on value added products 
the contracts for the sales of these products typically have longer terms than contracts for the sales of our minimally processed products and include fixed prices 
as a result  we believe that increased sales of further processed products will result in less volatility in the prices at which we sell our products 
sales of our value added products represented approximately of our sales in fiscal the industry has experienced volatility in results of operations over the last five years and expects the volatility to continue in the foreseeable future 
volatility in results of operations is generally attributable to fluctuations  which can be substantial  in broiler sales prices and cost of feed grains 
broiler sales prices tend to fluctuate due to changes in the supply of chicken  viability of export markets  supply and prices of competing meats and proteins  such as beef and pork  animal health factors in the global meat sector and general economic conditions 
according to the usda world agricultural outlook board waob  calendar us broiler meat production was approximately billion pounds  ready to cook weight  above the billion pounds produced in calendar the waob october estimate for calendar broiler meat production is billion pounds  which is a increase from calendar the increases are principally due to heavier bird weights and to a lesser extent  projected increased chick placements 
broiler production forecasts for the remainder of calendar are lower than previous projections primarily because broiler hatchery and laying flock data indicate a slower pace of production 
broiler supply was temporarily impacted by hurricane katrina although we did not incur any significant losses from the effects of the storm 
we do not have any operating facilities in louisiana or mississippi 
our export sales  which we define as sales other than to customers in the united states or canada  were million for fiscal or approximately of our net sales and of our pounds sold 
the us poultry industry historically has exported approximately to of domestic production  principally dark meat products to russia and other former soviet republics  hong kong  mexico and china 
our poultry export sales have historically been less than of net sales 
any disruption in the export markets can significantly impact domestic broiler sales prices by creating excess domestic supply 
although hurricane katrina has affected broiler exports  the disruptions are expected to be relatively short lived  as firms shift exports to other ports 
the cost of feed grains  primarily corn and soybean meal  averages approximately to of total live broiler production costs or approximately to of our cost of sales 
prices of feed grains fluctuate in response to worldwide supply and demand 
corn and soybean meal prices increased significantly in fiscal with soybean meal prices further increasing significantly in fiscal  due to stronger worldwide demand and reduced us crops due to weather problems in grain producing areas 
increased worldwide corn and soybean production favorably impacted feed ingredient costs in fiscal our average feed ingredient costs were significantly lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal  but were higher in the fourth quarter as compared to our third quarter of fiscal 
table of contents energy costs represent a significant component of product and delivery costs as such costs affect transportation costs  costs to operate poultry facilities and packaging costs 
general price increases and recent spikes in energy prices due to the effects of the hurricanes increased our energy costs in fiscal as compared to fiscal by 
although energy prices have moderated  it is expected that costs in the first half of fiscal will be higher than the first half of fiscal general issues such as increased domestic and global competition in the meat industry  heightened concerns over the security of the us food supply  volatility in feed grain commodity prices and export markets  increasing government regulation over animal production  animal welfare activism and animal disease including additional outbreaks of avian influenza continue as significant risks and challenges to profitability and growth  both for gold kist and the broiler industry in general 
although there are currently no reported avian influenza ai cases in commercial chicken in the united states and there has never been an outbreak of the hn high pathogenic asian strain of ai  confirmed cases in the us commercial poultry industry could have an adverse effect on the supply of chicken  domestic and foreign product demand and sales prices for chicken products and our results of operations and financial position 
see risk factors outbreaks of livestock diseases  particularly an outbreak of avian influenza among humans  could adversely affect our business 
references in this report to fiscal  fiscal  fiscal  fiscal and fiscal refer to our fiscal years ending or ended october   june   june   june  and june   respectively 
references in this report to transition quarter refer to the period from june  to october  results of operations the following table presents certain statement of operations items as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal years ended transition quarter ended fiscal year ended june  june  october  october  net sales cost of sales gross profit distribution  administrative and general expenses other gains expenses net operating income loss interest expense other expenses  net including income taxes net income loss fiscal compared to fiscal net sales our net sales for fiscal increased from billion in fiscal to billion in fiscal the increase in net sales was due primarily to a increase in broiler pounds produced and sold for the year ended october   partially offset by a decline of in average broiler sales prices during the same period 
a increase in processing yield and a increase in the number of chickens processed were the principal factors leading to the increased pounds produced and sold in fiscal over fiscal broiler sales prices weakened at the end of fiscal and are expected to weaken further during the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents final calendar quarter of due to seasonal factors historically experienced during the holiday season 
in addition  volume declines at quick service restaurants in response to the rise in energy prices have contributed to the weakening of the boneless skinless breast meat market prices 
our export sales of million for fiscal were higher than fiscal  due to increased shipments to russia and strong demand from other countries such as mexico  china and hong kong 
prices for dark meat products strengthened during fiscal our export sales to russia increased in dollar value and pounds shipped from fiscal prices for dark meat export products declined  however  in the latter half of the fourth fiscal quarter of and have continued to decline in the beginning of fiscal primarily due to reduced demand brought about by general concerns regarding avian influenza occurrences in asian countries 
net operating income we had net operating income of million for fiscal compared to net operating income of million in fiscal the decrease in net operating income in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to lower broiler selling prices and higher processing and other production costs in fiscal processing costs increased in total due to an increase in pounds processed and on a per pound basis due to higher freight and packaging costs resulting primarily from higher fuel and other energy prices 
during fiscal  higher processing costs were somewhat offset by lower total feed costs 
total feed costs for fiscal were lower than fiscal due to lower feed ingredient costs partially offset by the additional amounts of feed ingredients purchased relating to the increase in pounds produced 
average prices for corn and soybean meal for fiscal were and below fiscal  respectively 
although cash market prices for both soybean meal and corn declined further in the quarter ended october   the company was unable to fully benefit from these price declines due to priced forward purchase contracts that were entered into in order to secure a portion of our feed ingredient requirements 
this was the result of cash market prices for both soybean meal and corn below the prices that were fixed on a portion of our forward purchase contracts 
feed costs for the quarter ended october  were higher than in the quarter ended july  we had distribution  administrative and general expenses of million in fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was principally due to the noncash share based compensation expense of million related to the stock grants and awards issued to employees in october and january  partially offset by lower cash incentive compensation accruals 
approximately million of the share based compensation expense was recognized with respect to recipients aged or older and eligible for early retirement at which time the share based compensation awards would vest see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
expenses of million  principally advisory fees related to the conversion of gold kist from a cooperative marketing association to a for profit corporation  were incurred in fiscal pension settlement expense of million and million were recognized in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  due to lump sum distribution payments from the plans to electing retiring employees exceeding service and interest cost components of pension expense in the plan year 
other income expense other expenses  net totaled million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal interest expense was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of 
significantly lower average outstanding borrowings in fiscal were the principal factor leading to the decrease in interest expense 
in fiscal  we incurred a prepayment interest charge of million and wrote off deferred financing fees of million with respect to the payoff of a term loan with an insurance company with part of the proceeds from our issuance of million in senior notes 
during fiscal  in connection with the repayment of million principal amount of our senior notes with a portion of the proceeds from gold kist s initial public offering  we incurred a million prepayment interest charge 
in addition  we wrote 
table of contents off deferred financing costs of million and of the unamortized discount on the senior notes totaling million 
in september  we incurred a million prepayment interest charge in connection with the repayment of million principal amounts of series b and series c senior exchange notes with an insurance company and million principal amount of a term loan with an agricultural credit bank 
the million loss on investments in was related to an investment in a supply cooperative in which we are no longer a member 
the million loss on investment for fiscal represented the write off of our investment in southern states cooperative  inc discussed under other income expense within the fiscal compared to fiscal section below 
miscellaneous  net was income of million for fiscal compared to income of million for fiscal income from our hog production joint venture was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal due to improved hog market prices brought about by increased demand 
interest and dividend income was million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to higher interest income from additional cash invested in short term  interest bearing instruments  as well as higher interest rates in fiscal income tax expense for fiscal  our combined federal and state effective income tax rate used for purposes of calculating the tax expense on income before income taxes was 
income tax expense for fiscal reflects income taxes at statutory rates adjusted principally for available tax credits including state tax credits from prior years that became available and were recorded in fiscal the effective tax rate of in fiscal reflected the ordinary deduction for tax purposes for the abandonment of the ssc investment in june previously  we had recorded an income tax valuation allowance for the majority of the unrealized losses resulting from the write downs of the ssc investment 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for fiscal  net sales increased from billion in fiscal to billion in fiscal the increase in net sales volume was due primarily to an approximate increase in average broiler sales prices for fiscal  slightly offset by a decrease in broiler pounds produced and sold 
an overall strengthening economy  favorable production levels  improved export demand and higher prices in the beef and pork meat sectors contributed to stronger demand and higher broiler sales prices in fiscal diet trends emphasizing low fat proteins such as chicken also favorably impacted product demand 
our export sales of million for fiscal were higher than fiscal  due to substantially increased prices  the resumption of shipments to russia and increased demand from other countries 
an import quota system was negotiated and announced by russian officials in december the us share of the total quota was  tons or 
this is below the us levels of imports prior to the embargo  however  increased demand from other countries partially offset this reduction 
our export sales to russia increased in pounds shipped and in dollar value from million in fiscal to million in fiscal net operating income we had net operating income of million for fiscal compared to a net operating loss of million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in net operating income in fiscal was due primarily to higher broiler selling prices partially offset by higher feed ingredient costs  principally soybean meal 
soybean meal prices were higher per ton during fiscal compared to fiscal  and the average per bushel corn price was up 
the increased feed grain costs were due primarily to adverse weather conditions experienced late in the growing season 

table of contents cost of sales in fiscal included a million charge to write down the carrying value of the assets and recognize other expenses  primarily employee severance amounts  related to the closing of a poultry processing facility announced in september our pork production operations had net operating income of million for fiscal compared to a net operating loss of million for fiscal the improvement was attributable to improved hog market prices brought about by lower beef supplies and increased demand for pork products 
the year to date increase in distribution  administrative and general expenses was principally due to incentive compensation accruals associated with the net income for fiscal compared to the net losses in fiscal we also experienced higher benefit costs  principally pension expense and employee medical claims during fiscal  which contributed to the increase 
these costs were partially offset by benefit plan reductions and the impact of curtailments implemented in fiscal and we recognized million of pension settlement expense in fiscal the settlement expense resulted from lump sum distribution payments from the plans to electing retiring employees exceeding service and interest cost components of pension expense in the plan year 
other income expenses other expenses  including loss on investments  interest expense and miscellaneous  totaled million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal in october  southern states cooperative  inc  or ssc  notified us that  pursuant to the provisions of the indenture under which we purchased the capital trust securities  ssc would defer the quarterly interest payment due on october  interest payments for subsequent quarters were also deferred 
as a result of the deferral of the interest payments  we reduced the carrying value of the capital trust securities by million with a corresponding charge included in other deductions for fiscal as of december   ssc s total stockholders and patrons equity fell below our carrying value of the preferred stock investment  which we believed was a triggering event indicating impairment and recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million 
in june  we notified ssc that we were abandoning the capital trust securities and returned them 
as a result of the abandonment  we wrote off the remaining investment balance of million in june see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense was million for fiscal  compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in the fiscal interest expense was due to the higher interest rate on the senior notes compared to the average rates on other indebtedness 
higher interest rate spreads over the london interbank offered rate libor and amortization of fees related to the february amendment to our senior credit facility and the arrangement of our temporary revolving credit facility that matured on september  also contributed to the increase 
in addition  we incurred prepayment interest of million associated with the march repayment of the million term loan due to an insurance company with a portion of the proceeds from our march senior note offering 
miscellaneous  net was income of million for fiscal compared to expense of million in the prior fiscal year 
gains from the sale of assets and from the settlement in august of notes receivable that exceeded their carrying value were the primary items resulting in the fiscal income 
the notes receivable were acquired from the parent corporation of the other general partner of a pecan processing and marketing partnership that was dissolved in january the principal component of the expense we recorded in fiscal was a million payment we made in december for our share of a legal settlement as a former partner of a peanut processing and marketing company 
income from a hog production joint venture with another regional cooperative was million for fiscal as compared to a loss of million for fiscal due to improved hog market prices brought about by increased demand for pork products 

table of contents income tax expense for fiscal  our combined federal and state effective income tax rate used to calculate the tax expense on the income before income taxes was 
our effective tax rate is lower than the federal and state statutory rates for fiscal due primarily to the recognition of an ordinary deduction for tax purposes resulting from the abandonment of the ssc investment in june previously  we had recorded an income tax valuation allowance for the majority of the unrealized losses resulting from the write downs of the ssc investment 
income tax expense benefit for the periods presented reflects income taxes at statutory rates adjusted for available tax credits and deductible nonqualified equity redemptions 
transition quarter ended october  to three months ended september  net sales our net sales for the transition quarter ended october  increased compared to the quarter ended september  the increase in net sales volume was due primarily to an approximate increase in average broiler sales prices and an approximate increase in broiler pounds produced and sold for the transition quarter ended october  the extra week in the transition quarter contributed approximately two thirds of the increase in broiler pounds sold for the transition quarter ended october  an overall strengthening economy  favorable production levels  improved export demand and higher prices in the beef and pork meat sectors contributed to stronger demand and higher broiler sales prices in the transition quarter ended october  as compared to the quarter ended september  diet trends emphasizing low fat proteins such as chicken and new product introductions in fast food and quick service restaurants also favorably impacted product demand 
our export sales of million for the transition quarter ended october  were higher than the september quarter  due to increased prices  the continuation of shipments to russia and increased demand from other countries 
in addition  the extra week in the transition quarter contributed to the increase 
our export sales to russia increased in pounds shipped and in dollar value from million for the quarter ended september  to million for the transition quarter ended october  net operating income we had net operating income of million for the transition quarter ended october  compared to net operating income of million for the quarter ended september  the increase in net operating income was due primarily to higher broiler selling prices and increased volume  partially offset by higher feed ingredient costs  principally soybean meal 
feed costs for the transition quarter ended october  were higher than the quarter ended september  this increase was due primarily to a increase in our average per ton price of soybean meal and a increase in our average per bushel price of corn compared to prices in the comparable period in the prior year 
the increased feed grain costs were due primarily to adverse weather conditions experienced late in the growing season 
feed costs for the transition quarter ended october  were below feed costs for the quarter ended june  this decrease was due primarily to a decrease in our average per bushel price of corn partially offset by a increase in our average per ton price of soybean meal compared to prices in the quarter ended june although cash market prices for both soybean meal and corn declined in the transition quarter ended october   our ability to benefit from these price declines was negated by priced forward purchase contracts that were entered into in order to secure a portion of our feed ingredient requirements 
this was the result of cash market prices for both soybean meal and corn below the prices that were fixed on a portion of our forward purchase contracts 
the increase in distribution  administrative and general expenses for the transition quarter ended october  was principally due to the additional week of expenses and increased incentive compensation accruals associated with the higher net income for the transition quarter ended october  compared to the quarter ended september  we also experienced higher benefit costs during the transition quarter ended october   which contributed to the increase 

table of contents expenses of million including legal  printing  distribution and accounting fees related to our conversion of gold kist from a cooperative marketing association to a for profit corporation were deducted in determining net operating income

at october   we were in compliance with all applicable loan covenants under our senior notes and credit facilities 
for fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was million compared to cash provided from operating activities of million for fiscal the lower fiscal operating cash flow was due principally to decreased operating income and the million of pension plan contributions in excess of benefit plan expenses made in fiscal  partially offset by net cash used in fiscal and net cash provided in fiscal by changes in operating assets and liabilities 
for fiscal  cash used in investing activities was million compared to million in fiscal the increase was due principally to the million in capital expenditures for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this includes expenditures for expansion of further processing capacity  technological advances in our poultry production and processing operations and expanded chill pack capacity 
in addition  capital expenditures included other asset improvements and necessary replacements 
we have funded fiscal

working capital and patrons and other equity stockholders equity were million and million  respectively  at october  compared to million and million  respectively  at june  lower levels of current assets and higher levels of current liabilities  due principally to income taxes payable and lower current deferred tax assets  resulted in the lower working capital level at october  the increase in total equity resulted from the additional paid in capital in excess of the cash distributions to members and equity holders from the initial public offering in october and from our net income for fiscal effective january   we prospectively amended our qualified pension plan 
for benefits earned in and future years  the basic pension formula was changed from to of final average earnings  early retirement benefits were reduced  and the lump sum distribution option is no longer available

annual grower pay has averaged approximately million per year over the past two years with the actual amounts determined by relative performance  fuel adjustments and other factors 
grower payments have not been included in the contractual obligations table due to the inherent uncertainty of the future amounts 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the fiscal years presented 
the following is a summary of certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical 
other significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
substantially all of our revenue generating activities consist of the sale of poultry products to our customers 
substantially all sales are shipped by truck and the revenue is recognized upon passage of title and risk of loss to the customer 
there are no additional services or processes to be performed following delivery of the product 
revenue is recorded net of amounts for any discounts  allowances or promotions 
estimates for any special pricing arrangements  promotions or other volume based incentives are recorded upon shipment of the product in accordance with the terms of the promotion  allowance or pricing arrangements 
inventories 
live poultry inventories consist of broilers and breeders 
broilers are stated at the lower of average cost or market and breeders are stated at average cost less accumulated amortization 
costs include live production costs principally feed  chick cost  medications and other raw materials  labor and production overhead 
breeder costs include acquisition of chicks from parent stock breeders  feed  medication  labor and production costs that are accumulated up to the production stage and then amortized over their estimated useful life of thirty six weeks 
marketable product inventories and raw materials and supplies are stated on the basis of the lower of cost first in  first out or average or market 
if market prices for inventories move below carrying value  adjustments to write down the carrying values of these inventories would be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on an analysis of the status of individual accounts 
factors such as current overall economic and industry conditions  historical customer performance and current financial condition  collateral position and delinquency trends are used in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
changes in the economy  industry and specific customer conditions may require us to adjust the allowance amount recorded 
these estimates involve management judgment and could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position 
accrued insurance costs 
we retain for certain losses related to property  fleet  product and general liability  worker s compensation and employee medical benefits 
stop loss coverage for claims exceeding the self retention level is maintained with third party insurers to limit our total exposure 
estimates of the ultimate cost of claims incurred are accrued based on historical data and estimated future costs 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information available  actual costs could differ and materially impact our results of operations and financial position 

table of contents employee benefits 
we incur various employment related benefit costs with respect to qualified and nonqualified pensions and deferred compensation plans 
assumptions are made related to discount rates used to value certain liabilities  assumed rates of return on assets in the plans  compensation increases  employee turnover and mortality rates 
we utilize third party actuarial firms to assist management in determining these assumptions 
different assumptions could result in the recognition of differing amounts of expense over different periods of time 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities at current tax rates 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the recoverability of the tax assets recorded on the balance sheet is based on both our historical and anticipated earnings levels and is reviewed to determine if any additional valuation allowance is necessary when it is more likely than not that amounts will not be recovered 
share based compensation 
the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  in january sfas no 
r requires the determination of share based payments as equity or liability classified and measurement of the payment at fair value 
assumptions and judgments are made by management concerning the classification and valuation of the stock grants and awards  the requisite service periods  the assessment of the conditions imposed by the payment  employee turnover  volatility  the term of the awards and other factors used in determining the compensation expense 
we expect to make additional share based payments in the future and different assumptions and judgments could result in different costs that could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  the resolution of implementation issues and further interpretations with regard to sfas r could impact the assumptions and judgments used by us in earlier or future periods 
effects of inflation the major factor affecting our net sales and cost of sales is the change in market prices for broilers  hogs and feed grains 
the prices of these commodities are affected by world market conditions and are volatile in response to supply and demand  as well as political and economic events 
the price fluctuations of these commodities do not necessarily correlate with the general inflation rate 
inflation can  however  adversely affect operating costs such as labor  energy and material costs 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs  effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the statement clarifies how to account for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage 
companies will no longer be allowed to capitalize such abnormal amounts in inventory 
in addition  fixed overhead allocated to inventories should be based on normal capacity 
the implementation of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r was issued 
the statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
effective in january  we adopted the provisions of sfas r 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in october  the american jobs creation act ajca was signed into law 
the ajca allows for a federal income tax deduction for a percentage of income generated from certain domestic production activities 
our production activities will qualify for the deduction 
based on the effective date of the ajca  we became eligible for this deduction in the last quarter of fiscal additionally  in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position  application of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp 
fsp  which was effective upon issuance  states the deduction under this provision of the ajca should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with sfas the benefit realized from this provision was not significant in fiscal in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and requires retrospective application to previously issued financial statements as if that principle had always been used  unless it is impracticable to do so 
the requirements are effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december  and are not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements

although we have international sales and related accounts receivable from foreign customers  there is no foreign currency exchange risk as all sales are denominated in us dollars 
commodities risk 
we are a purchaser of certain agricultural commodities used for the manufacture of poultry feeds 
we use commodity futures and options for economic hedging purposes to reduce the effect of changing commodity prices and to ensure supply of a portion of our commodity inventories and related purchase and sale contracts 
feed ingredient futures and option contracts  primarily corn and soybean meal  are accounted for at fair value 
changes in fair value on these commodity futures and options are recorded as a component of product cost in the consolidated statements of operations 
terms of our senior credit facility limit the use of forward purchase contracts and commodities futures and options transactions 
as of october   the difference between the notional amounts and fair value of our outstanding commodity futures and options positions was not material 
feed ingredient purchase commitments for corn and soybean meal in the ordinary course of business were million at october  these commitments include both priced and unpriced contracts 
unpriced feed ingredient commitments are valued at market for the month of delivery as of october  based on estimated annual feed usage  a increase in the weighted average cost of feed ingredients would increase cost of sales by an estimated million 
the sensitivity analysis presented above is the measure of potential losses resulting from a hypothetical increase in market prices related to corn and soybean meal 
sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions management may take to mitigate exposure to changes  nor do they consider the effects that such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity 
in addition  actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes 
interest rate risk 
we have exposure to changes in interest rates on our revolving credit agreement  if utilized 
the interest rates on our amended senior credit facilities fluctuate based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
assuming our revolver  as amended from million to million in december  was fully drawn  a change in libor would increase annual interest expense by approximately million
