item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the information set forth under the caption entitled item selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
headwaters fiscal year ends on september and unless otherwise noted  future references to years refer to headwaters fiscal year rather than a calendar year 
introduction during the past several years  headwaters has executed on its two fold plan of maximizing cash flow from its existing operating business units and diversifying from over reliance on the legacy alternative energy segment 
with the addition and expansion of the ccp management and marketing business through the acquisitions of isg in and vfl in  and the growth of the construction materials business  culminating in the acquisitions of eldorado  tapco and scp in  headwaters has achieved revenue growth and diversification into three business segments 
because headwaters also incurred increased indebtedness to make strategic acquisitions  one of management s ongoing financial objectives is to continue to focus on increased cash flows for purposes of reducing indebtedness 
headwaters acquisition strategy targets businesses that are leading players in their respective industries  that enjoy healthy margins from products and services and that are not overly capital intensive  thus providing additional cash flow that complements the financial performance of headwaters existing business segments 
headwaters is also committed to continuing to invest in hti s research and development activities which are focused on energy related technologies and nanotechnology 
in  headwaters announced a non binding memorandum of understanding to participate in a joint venture to build and operate an ethanol plant 
headwaters continues to move forward on this project and is also investigating other alternative energy projects such as coal cleaning and the use of nanocatalysts to engineer coal for emissions reduction 
as a result of its diversification into ccps and construction materials  headwaters is affected by seasonality  with the highest revenues and profitability produced in the june and september quarters 
with ccps  headwaters strategy is to continue to negotiate long term contracts so that it may invest in transportation and storage infrastructure for the marketing and sale of ccps 
headwaters also intends to continue its efforts to expand usage of high value ccps and develop uses for lower value ccps  including the expanded usage of ccps in its construction materials businesses and the industry in general 
headwaters acquisitions of eldorado and tapco have created a concentration in the residential housing market  however  the cyclicality and interest rate sensitivity of this segment may be mitigated by the fact that approximately of tapco s products are used in the home improvement and remodeling market 
this market is typically counter cyclical to the new construction market because remodeling is generally less expensive than a new home and is often required to maintain older homes and preserve their value 
as a result  during economic downturns  tapco s products have historically experienced growth 
in light of headwaters leading market shares in eldorado s and tapco s markets  headwaters has increased production capacity for eldorado and has initiated the development and marketing of new products from tapco in order to maintain the historical growth rates of the construction materials segment 
in  headwaters focused on integration of its recent acquisitions  including the marketing of diverse construction materials products through its national distribution network  and developing the corporate infrastructure necessary to provide the information and services that the business segments need to operate at optimal levels 
headwaters became highly leveraged as a result of the fiscal acquisitions  but has reduced its outstanding debt in through cash generated from operations  from an underwritten public offering of common stock and from proceeds from settlement of litigation 
headwaters intends to continue to focus on repaying long term debt while continuing to look for diversification opportunities within prescribed parameters 
consolidation  acquisitions and segments consolidation and acquisitions 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of headwaters  all of its subsidiaries and other entities in which headwaters has a controlling financial interest 
headwaters is also required to consolidate any variable interest entities for which it is the primary beneficiary  however  as of september   there are none 
for investments in companies in which headwaters has a significant influence over operating and financial decisions generally defined as owning a voting or economic interest of to  headwaters applies the equity method of accounting 
in instances where headwaters investment is less than and significant influence does not exist  investments are carried at cost 
all significant intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation 
headwaters acquired vfl on april   eldorado stone on june   scp on july   and tapco on september  these entities results of operations for the periods from the acquisition dates through september  have been consolidated with headwaters and results and their operations up to the dates of acquisition have not been included in headwaters consolidated results for any period 
due to the significance of the acquisitions  in many instances the consolidated financial statements and components of those financial statements included in the following discussion and analysis are not comparable to the financial statements or components thereof 
segments 
headwaters operates in three business segments  construction materials  ccps and alternative energy 
these segments are managed and evaluated separately by management based on fundamental differences in their operations  products and services 
prior to  the businesses in the construction materials segment manufactured and distributed value added bagged concrete  stucco  mortar and block products 
the acquisition of scp expanded headwaters concrete block business and the acquisition of eldorado added manufactured architectural stone to the construction materials product line 
the acquisition of tapco  a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of building products used in exterior residential home improvement and construction  added significantly to this segment 
revenues for the construction materials segment consist of product sales to wholesale and retail distributors  contractors and other users of building products and construction materials 
the ccp segment markets coal combustion products such as fly ash and bottom ash  known as ccps  to the building products and ready mix concrete industries 
headwaters markets ccps to replace manufactured or mined materials  such as portland cement  lime  agricultural gypsum  fired lightweight aggregate  granite aggregate and limestone 
headwaters has long term contracts  primarily with coal fired electric power generation plants  pursuant to which it manages the post combustion operations for the utilities 
ccp revenues consist primarily of product sales with a smaller amount of service revenue 
vfl has been included in headwaters ccp segment since its acquisition in april the alternative energy segment includes headwaters legacy coal based solid alternative fuels business and hti s business of developing catalyst technologies to convert coal and heavy oil into higher value liquid fuels  as well as nanocatalyst processes and applications 
revenues for this segment consist primarily of sales of chemical reagents and license fees 
critical accounting policies and estimates headwaters significant accounting policies are identified and described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with u 
s 
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
headwaters continually evaluates its policies and estimation procedures 
estimates are often based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  but which could change in the future 
some of headwaters accounting policies and estimation procedures require the use of substantial judgment  and actual results could differ materially from the estimates underlying the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
such policies and estimation procedures have been reviewed with headwaters audit committee 
the following is a discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates 
license fee revenue recognition 
headwaters currently licenses its technologies to the owners of coal based solid alternative fuel facilities in the united states 
recurring license fees or royalty payments are recognized in the period when earned  which coincides with the sale of synthetic fuel by headwaters licensees 
in most instances  headwaters receives timely reports from licensees notifying headwaters of the amount of solid synthetic fuel sold and the royalty due headwaters under the terms of the respective license fee agreements 
additionally  headwaters has experienced a regular pattern of payment by these licensees of the reported amounts 
estimates of license fee revenue earned  where required  can be reliably made based upon historical experience and or communications from licensees with whom an established pattern exists 
in some cases  however  such as when a licensee is beginning to produce and sell synthetic fuel or when a synthetic fuel facility is sold by a licensee to another entity  and for which there is no pattern or knowledge of past or current production and sales activity  there may be more limited information available to estimate the license fee revenue earned 
in these situations  headwaters uses such information as is available and where possible  substantiates the information through such procedures as observing the levels of chemical reagents purchased by the licensee and used in the production of the solid synthetic fuel 
in certain limited situations  headwaters is unable to reliably estimate the license fee revenues earned during a period  and revenue recognition is delayed until a future date when sufficient information is known from which to make a reasonable estimation 
pursuant to the contractual terms of an agreement with one licensee  the license fees owed to headwaters  which accumulated during a period of approximately two and a half years  were placed in escrow for the benefit of headwaters  pending resolution of an audit of the licensee by the irs 
prior to december   certain accounting rules governing revenue recognition  requiring that the seller s price to the buyer be fixed or determinable as well as reasonably certain of collection  appeared to preclude revenue recognition for the amounts placed in escrow because they were potentially subject to adjustment based on the outcome of the irs audit 
accordingly  none of the escrowed amounts were recognized as revenue in the consolidated statements of income through december  during the march quarter  the fieldwork for the tax audit of the licensee was completed and there were no proposed adjustments to the tax credits claimed by the licensee 
as a result  in march headwaters recognized revenue  net of the amount headwaters was required to pay to a third party  relating to the funds deposited in the escrow account totaling approximately million 
approximately million of this amount related to revenue recorded in the march quarter and approximately million was recorded as revenue related to prior periods 
interest income of approximately million was also recognized 
during the june quarter  the irs completed its administrative review of the licensee s tax audit and the escrowed amounts were disbursed from the escrow account and paid to headwaters 
in addition to the escrowed amounts  this same licensee has also set aside substantial amounts for working capital and other operational contingencies as provided for in the contractual agreements 
these amounts may eventually be paid out to various parties having an interest in the cash flows from the licensee s operations  including headwaters  if they are not used for working capital and other operational contingencies 
as a result  headwaters currently expects to receive at some future date a portion of those reserves  the amount of which is not currently determinable and therefore  not recognizable 
in december  headwaters entered into a technology license and proprietary chemical reagent sale agreement with ajg financial services  inc the agreement provided for ajg to pay royalties and allowed ajg to purchase proprietary chemical reagent material from headwaters 
in october  headwaters filed a complaint in the fourth district court for the state of utah against ajg alleging that it had failed to make payments and to perform other obligations under the agreement 
headwaters asserted claims including breach of contract and sought money damages as well as other relief 
ajg s answer to the complaint denied headwaters claims and asserted counter claims based upon allegations of misrepresentation and breach of contract 
this litigation came to the trial phase in january the jury reached a verdict substantially in favor of headwaters and the court entered a judgment for headwaters against ajg in the amount of approximately million which included approximately million in prejudgment interest 
in may  headwaters and ajg entered into a settlement agreement which provided for payments to headwaters in the amount of million at the time of settlement which payment was received in may  million related to a contract modification for use of technology in january  and certain quarterly payments based upon tax credits associated with ajg s facilities for calendar years through payments based upon tax credits associated with ajg s facilities for the first three quarters of calendar year will be received in january  with all other quarterly payments for through payable days after the end of each quarter 
payments based upon tax credits for through are subject to downward adjustment or elimination if a phase out of section tax credits occurs due to high oil prices 
headwaters recognized the million contract litigation settlement gain  net of payments due to a third party  as a reduction in operating costs and expenses in the quarter ended june  the million  net of payments due to a third party  is being recognized as revenue over calendar years through  however  because the settlement agreement was not reached until may  six months of revenue covering the period january  through june  was recognized in the quarter ended june  the ongoing quarterly payments based upon tax credits are being recognized as revenue in accordance with headwaters revenue recognition policy for license fee revenue 
in connection with the settlement of the ajg litigation  headwaters also recognized as revenue approximately million of revenue from a licensee with an indirect interest in that litigation  all of which related to periods prior to january  ongoing revenue from this licensee is also being recognized in accordance with headwaters revenue recognition policy for license fee revenue 
valuation of long lived assets  including intangible assets and goodwill 
long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
intangible assets consist primarily of identifiable intangible assets obtained in connection with acquisitions 
see acquisitions above and note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of the purchase price allocations for the acquisitions  including the valuations of intangible assets 
these intangible assets are being amortized on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price for businesses acquired over the fair value of identified assets acquired  net of liabilities assumed 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized  but is tested at least annually for impairment  as of june  using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair values of the reporting units with goodwill 
currently  five reporting units have goodwill  as follows i hti  ii ccps  iii eldorado  iv scp  and v tapco 
step of impairment testing consists of determining and comparing the fair values of the reporting units to the carrying values of those reporting units 
if step is failed for any of the reporting units  indicating a potential impairment  headwaters would be required to complete step  which is a more detailed test to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill  and compare that value to the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss is required to be recorded 
headwaters has performed step impairment tests of recorded goodwill as of june   and  all of which indicated that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values 
accordingly  step of the impairment tests was not required to be performed  and no impairment charge was necessary 
in addition to its annual review  headwaters evaluates  based on current events and circumstances  the carrying value of long lived assets  including intangible assets and goodwill  as well as the related amortization periods  to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or to the useful lives are required 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  or changes in headwaters business model or capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from headwaters current estimates 
in those cases where headwaters determines that the useful life of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets should be shortened  headwaters would amortize the net book value in excess of salvage value over its revised remaining useful life  thereby increasing depreciation or amortization expense 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated cumulative undiscounted cash flow from that asset is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
indicators of impairment include such things as a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the general business climate  a decline in operating performance indicators  a significant change in competition  or an expectation that significant assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
it is possible that some of headwaters tangible or intangible long lived assets or goodwill could be impaired in the future and that resulting write downs could be material 
stock based compensation 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  headwaters early adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation required by sfas no 
r  effective as of october   the beginning of headwaters fiscal year 
sfas no 
r revises sfas no 
and supersedes apb and requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options and other equity based awards 
for  headwaters recorded a total of million of pre tax expense related to stock based compensation  substantially all of which related to the adoption of sfas no 
r  and none of which involved the expenditure of cash 
due to immateriality  headwaters did not capitalize any compensation cost as part of the cost of any asset 
beginning october   headwaters reclassified certain stock based compensation expense recorded in prior periods to conform to the current period presentation so that stock based compensation expense is reported within the same operating expense line items as used for cash compensation expense 
the tax benefits resulting from exercise of stock options and stock appreciation rights sars are reflected in the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity and cash flows 
headwaters recognizes compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of stock based awards for all awards expected to vest  over the period during which the related service is rendered by grantees 
the fair value of stock based awards is determined primarily using the black scholes merton b s m model  which is the same valuation model used previously in valuing stock options for the pro forma footnote disclosures under the requirements of sfas no 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
headwaters uses the graded vesting or accelerated method to value awards and to allocate those values over the requisite service periods  again the same method as used previously in determining pro forma expense under sfas no 
the b s m model requires assumptions as to expected stock price volatility  expected lives  rate of forfeitures and other factors 
judgment is involved in determining appropriate assumptions to use and different assumptions can yield materially different results 
headwaters uses various methods  along with historical data and other information  to make reasonable assumptions regarding inputs to the b s m model 
in addition  in  headwaters used the services of an independent valuation firm to validate its fair value estimates and assumptions and also to determine certain necessary adjustments to the b s m model output 
one such adjustment was used in determining the fair value of sars which have a cap on allowed appreciation 
for these sars  the output determined by the b s m model was reduced by an amount determined by a quasi monte carlo simulation to reflect the reduction in fair value associated with the appreciation cap 
substantially all of the sars that headwaters awarded in that vest over five years are exercisable based on the achievement of performance criteria related to the economic growth eva of headwaters during the five year period 
headwaters currently expects the performance criteria to be achieved 
if this expectation changes in the future  some or all of the compensation expense recognized up to that time would be reversed 
headwaters implemented sfas no 
r effective as of october   using the modified retrospective method with restatement limited to interim periods in the year of adoption  as permitted by sfas no 
r 
accordingly  headwaters adjusted the amounts previously reported in its consolidated statement of income for the six months ended march  in deriving the statement of income amounts reported for the application of sfas no 
r for the six months ended march  had the effect of reducing net income for that period by million  the same amount as reported in the pro forma sfas no 
footnote disclosure in headwaters march  form q 
the adoption of sfas no 
r had the following effect on reported amounts for under previous sfas no 
r in millions  except per share data accounting adjustments as reported income before income taxes net income basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share cash flows from operating activities cash flows from financing activities a significant amount of the effect of the sfas no 
r adjustments reported above resulted from the expense associated with immediately vested sars granted in and from the acceleration of vesting of certain stock options which also occurred in  all as discussed in note as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r  headwaters will recognize additional non cash compensation expense in future periods 
as of september   there is approximately million of total compensation cost related to nonvested awards not yet recognized 
this unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
as reflected in the table above and in the consolidated statements of cash flows  the adoption of sfas no 
r required reclassification of the tax benefits from exercise of stock based awards as a cash flow from financing activities instead of a cash flow from operating activities  the required classification under prior accounting rules 
in addition  sfas no 
r mandated certain changes in the calculation of diluted earnings per share  as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of sfas no 
r  combined with the settlement of the ajg litigation described in note to the consolidated financial statements  was a contributing factor in headwaters decision to grant employee incentive awards in may  in particular to grant more sars  including many that vested immediately  or are exercisable only to the extent performance criteria are met  and to grant fewer options  and to accelerate the vesting of stock options 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  the information set forth below compares headwaters operating results for the year ended september  with operating results for the year ended september  
revenue 
total revenue for increased by million or to billion as compared to million for the major components of revenue are discussed in the sections below 
construction materials segment 
sales of construction materials during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
sales of construction materials during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the increase in sales of construction materials during was due primarily to the acquisitions of eldorado  scp and tapco in fiscal the increase in gross margin percentage from to was due primarily to significantly higher margins from the operations of the acquired businesses 
ccp segment 
ccp revenues for were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
ccp revenues for were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the increase in ccp revenues during was due primarily to the acquisition of vfl in april and growth in demand for ccps  partially due to shortages in portland cement for which ccps are a substitute  which can result in an increased percentage of ccps being used in concrete 
the cement shortages also resulted in increased prices for ccps in several markets 
the gross margin percentage decreased from to by approximately due primarily to vfl  which typically has lower gross margins than the legacy ccp business 
vfl s impact on gross margin in was more significant than in because there was only six months of vfl activity in alternative energy segment 
headwaters alternative energy segment revenue consists primarily of chemical reagent sales  license fee revenue related to its solid alternative fuel technologies  and to a lesser extent  sales of synthetic fuel from two solid alternative fuel production facilities that it owns that began operating in revenue from the sale of synthetic fuel has a negative gross margin  but is more than compensated for from the income tax credits earned from the sales of the synthetic fuel 
hti s revenues are also included in alternative energy revenue  but comprise a minor portion of total segment revenue 
sales of chemical reagents 
chemical reagent sales during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
chemical reagent sales during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the increase in chemical reagent sales during was due primarily to increased synthetic fuel production by headwaters licensees resulting in increased sales of million and by customers with whom headwaters does not have a license agreement resulting in increased sales of million 
of the increased sales to customers  million represents sales of chemical reagent related to the coal based solid alternative fuel production facility in which headwaters is a minority owner see note to the consolidated financial statements 
it is not possible to predict the trend of sales of chemical reagents 
the gross margin percentage for of was lower than for  due primarily to increases in the cost of product  which in turn is related to recent increases in the costs of petroleum based materials  and to a lesser extent  changes in customer mix 
headwaters believes additional cost increases are likely in future periods and that some but not all of such increases can be passed on to customers  potentially adversely affecting margins in future periods 
license fees 
during  headwaters recognized license fee revenue totaling million  an increase of million or from million of license fee revenue recognized during the primary reasons for the increase in license fee revenue in compared to relate to the settlement of the ajg litigation described below and in note to the consolidated financial statements million in total 
in addition  license fee revenue from licensees not associated with the litigation increased million from to as a result of increased production of alternative fuel by these licensees 
in may  headwaters and ajg entered into a settlement agreement which provided for payments to headwaters in the amount of million at the time of settlement discussed below in the caption contract litigation settlement  million related to a contract modification for use of technology in january  and certain quarterly payments based upon tax credits associated with ajg s facilities for calendar years through the million  net of payments due to a third party  is being recognized as revenue over calendar years through  however  because the settlement agreement was not reached until may  six months of revenue covering the period january  through june  was recognized in the quarter ended june  the ongoing quarterly payments are being recognized as revenue in accordance with headwaters revenue recognition policy for license fee revenue 
in total  headwaters recognized approximately million of license fees from ajg in million of which directly related to the settlement of litigation  compared to million of license fee revenue from ajg in in connection with the settlement of the ajg litigation  headwaters also recognized as revenue approximately million of revenue from a licensee with an indirect interest in that litigation  all related to periods prior to january  ongoing revenue from this licensee is also being recognized in accordance with headwaters revenue recognition policy for license fee revenue and was approximately million in offsetting these increases  was a million decrease in revenue recognized from a licensee for which headwaters recognized million of net revenue in  representing funds previously deposited in an escrow account pending resolution of certain contingencies  all relating to alternative fuel sold prior to december  headwaters recognized a total of approximately million of revenue from this licensee in and million of revenue in for more information about the revenue related to this licensee  see license fee revenue recognition in the critical accounting policies and estimates section above 
pursuant to the contractual terms of an agreement with this same licensee  the licensee has set aside substantial amounts for working capital and other operational contingencies as provided for in the contractual agreements 
these amounts may eventually be paid out to various parties having an interest in the cash flows from the licensee s operations  including headwaters  if they are not used for working capital and other operational contingencies 
as a result  headwaters currently expects to receive at some future date a portion of those reserves  the amount of which is not currently determinable and therefore  not recognizable 
headwaters license fees and revenues from sales of chemical reagents depend on the ability of licensees and customers to manufacture and sell qualified synthetic fuels that generate tax credits under section of the internal revenue code 
from time to time  issues arise as to the availability of tax credits and the potential phase out of credits with the rising price of oil  as described in section matters below 
due to the potential significance of these issues  it is not possible to predict the trend of license fees or alternative energy revenue in future periods 
amortization 
these costs increased by million to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the fiscal acquisitions and the resulting increases in amortizable intangible assets 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by million to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased hti research and development activities and the recognition of approximately million of stock based compensation expense in related to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
no such expense was recorded in headwaters remains committed to hti s research and development efforts and future expenses are more likely to approximate amounts than previous year amounts 
contract litigation settlement 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  in may  headwaters settled its litigation with ajg 
in connection with the litigation settlement  a payment of million was received in may 
this amount  net of payments due to a third party and less the amount recognized as a reimbursement of legal fees approximately million  was reflected as a reduction in operating costs and expenses because it represents a non recurring litigation settlement that is not reflective of headwaters revenue components described above  but is directly related to headwaters operating activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
these expenses increased million to million for from million for the increase in was due primarily to an increase in stock based compensation expense of approximately million and the fiscal acquisitions approximately million 
a substantial portion of the expense related to stock based compensation represent the expense associated with the grant of immediate vested sars and the acceleration of vesting of certain stock options million  as explained in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these two events are not likely to recur in the foreseeable future 
there was only million of stock based compensation included in selling  general  and administrative expenses in other income and expense 
during  headwaters reported net other expense of million compared to net other expense of million during the change of million was attributable to an increase in net interest expense of million in and a net increase in other expenses of approximately million in net interest expense increased from million in to million in due primarily to significantly higher average levels of long term debt in compared to  as a result of the fiscal acquisitions 
headwaters incurred approximately million of interest expense related to the early repayment of senior debt in  consisting of accelerated amortization of debt issue costs of million plus million of prepayment penalties 
in connection with the reduction of the amount of senior debt hedged from million to million  as allowed under terms of the amended credit facility  headwaters recognized a gain of approximately million  which was recorded as a reduction in interest expense 
the net change in other expenses of million consisted primarily of a million increase in costs related to headwaters investment in the coal based solid alternative fuel production facility described in note to the consolidated financial statements  partially reduced by million of losses on notes receivable and other asset write offs in that did not recur in and an increase of million in gain on disposition of property  plant and equipment 
income tax provision 
headwaters effective income tax rate for was approximately 
this compares to an effective tax rate of approximately for the primary reason for the decrease in the effective tax rate is the federal income tax credits available as a result of headwaters investment in an entity that owns and operates a coal based solid alternative fuel production facility see note to the consolidated financial statements  as well as headwaters ownership of two other alternative fuel production facilities that began operating in the alternative fuel produced at these three facilities through december qualifies for tax credits pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
excluding the effect of the tax credits  headwaters effective tax rate in would have been approximately year ended september  compared to year ended september  the information set forth below compares headwaters operating results for the year ended september  with operating results for the year ended september  
revenue 
total revenue for increased by million or to million as compared to million for the major components of revenue are discussed in the sections below 
construction materials segment 
sales of construction materials during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
sales of construction materials during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the increase in sales of construction materials during was due primarily to the acquisitions of eldorado in june  scp in july and tapco in september revenues for these acquired companies for totaled million 
the increase in gross margin percentage from to was due primarily to significantly higher margins from the operations of the acquired businesses  partially offset by certain inventory and other balance sheet adjustments  some of which related to original purchase price allocations  related to the legacy construction materials businesses 
ccp segment 
ccp revenues for were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
ccp revenues for were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the increase in ccp revenues during was due primarily to increased demand for high value ccp products  the acquisition of vfl in april  and the renegotiation of certain service agreements 
the increased demand for high value fly ash products was the result of continued strength in the construction market coupled with a tight market for cement  with cement shortages occurring in some regional markets 
these conditions allowed headwaters to increase prices in certain ccp markets 
vfl s revenues for totaled million 
the gross margin percentage increased from to by approximately due primarily to benefits realized from the renegotiation of the service agreements 
sales of chemical reagents 
chemical reagent sales during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
chemical reagent sales during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the increase in chemical reagent sales during was due primarily to significantly increased synthetic fuel production by headwaters licensees resulting in increased sales of million  largely offset by decreased synthetic fuel production by customers with which headwaters does not have a license agreement resulting in decreased sales of million 
the gross margin percentage for of was approximately the same as for license fees 
during  headwaters recognized license fee revenue totaling million  an increase of million or over million of license fee revenue recognized during the primary reason for the increase in license fee revenue in compared to was the recognition in march of million of net revenue relating to funds previously deposited in an escrow account by one of headwaters licensees relating to alternative fuel sold prior to december   plus approximately million of net revenue relating to the march  june and september quarters 
amortization 
amortization increased by million to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisitions and the resulting increase in amortizable intangible assets 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by million to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased hti research and development activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
these expenses increased million to million for from million for the increase in was due primarily to the acquisitions million and increased incentive pay expenses million  along with certain increases in various other costs incidental to growth  primarily payroll related costs 
the increase in incentive pay expenses was the result of obligations under headwaters incentive bonus plans  resulting from improved operating results in  a significant portion of which related to revenue recognized from escrowed funds in march  as previously discussed 
other income and expense 
during  headwaters reported net other expense of million compared to net other expense of million during the change of million was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest expense of million in and a net increase in other expenses of million in net interest expense increased from million in to million in  due primarily to higher average levels of long term debt in compared to  primarily related to the acquisitions  and accelerated non cash interest expense related to the substantial increase in debt repayments that were made in compared to in  debt repayments totaled approximately million  which consisted largely of early repayments 
in  debt repayments totaled approximately million 
as a result of the increase in repayments in  non cash interest expense  representing amortization of debt discount and debt issue costs  increased from million in to million in the net change in other expenses of million consisted primarily of a write off of million of deferred acquisition costs related to projects that were abandoned in and an increase of million in losses on disposition of property  plant and equipment in income tax provision 
in  headwaters recorded an income tax provision at an effective tax rate of approximately 
in  the effective tax rate was approximately the same at 
impact of inflation and related matters headwaters operations have been impacted in by rising costs for chemical reagents in the alternative energy segment  by increased cement  polypropylene and poly vinyl chloride costs in the construction materials segment and by increased fuel costs that have affected transportation costs in most of headwaters business units 
the increased costs of chemical reagents  polypropylene  poly vinyl chloride and fuel are directly related to the increase in prices of oil and other petroleum based materials 
the increased costs of cement are caused primarily by a lack of adequate supplies in some regions of the us headwaters has been successful in passing on some  but not all  of the increased material and transportation costs to customers 
it is not possible to predict the future trend of material and transportation costs  nor the ability of headwaters to pass on any future price increases to customers 
it is also not possible to predict the impact of potential future cement supply shortages on headwaters ability to procure needed supplies in its construction materials business 
liquidity and capital resources summary of cash flow activities 
net cash provided by operating activities during was million compared to million during the change was attributable to increases in in net income million  depreciation and amortization million and non cash stock based compensation million  reduced by deferred taxes million and other items million net 
in  headwaters issued million shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering for net cash proceeds of million 
headwaters used million of the cash generated from the issuance of common stock to repay debt  and the remaining proceeds were temporarily invested in short term trading investments and ultimately used for acquisitions 
in  headwaters issued million shares of common stock in another underwritten public offering for net cash proceeds of million 
headwaters also used these proceeds to repay debt 
during  million of debt was repaid  net of proceeds from issuance of debt  compared to a net million increase in debt in in  the primary investing activity consisted of four acquisitions resulting in total net cash payments of million 
in the primary investing activity consisted of the purchase of property  plant and equipment for total cash payments of million 
more details about headwaters investing and financing activities are provided in the following paragraphs 
investing activities 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  headwaters acquired four companies in fiscal primarily as a result of these acquisitions  expenditures for property  plant and equipment increased substantially from million to million 
these capital expenditures primarily relate to the construction materials segment million 
capital expenditures for are currently expected to approximate the limitation on such expenditures of million included in the senior debt covenants 
a significant portion of headwaters capital expenditures relate to expansion of operations  rather than maintenance of operating capacity  and a significant portion of the anticipated increase in capital expenditures from to is expected to be in the ccp and alternative energy segments 
the unused amounts of the annual capital expenditures limits in the senior debt agreements can generally be carried over from year to year 
as of september   headwaters was committed to spend approximately million on capital projects that were in various stages of completion 
headwaters intends to continue to expand its business through growth of existing operations  commercialization of technologies currently being developed  and strategic acquisitions of products or entities that expand headwaters current operating platform 
acquisitions are an important part of headwaters business strategy and to that end  headwaters routinely reviews potential complementary acquisitions  including those in the areas of construction materials  ccp marketing  and coal and catalyst technologies 
it is possible that some portion of future cash and cash equivalents and or proceeds from the issuance of stock or debt will be used to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses in the chemical  energy  building products and related industries 
the senior secured credit agreement limits acquisitions to million each fiscal year  of which cash consideration may not exceed million  unless headwaters total leverage ratio  as defined  is less than or equal to  after giving effect to an acquisition  in which case the foregoing million cash limitation does not apply 
the senior secured credit agreement also limits the amount headwaters can invest in joint ventures and other less than owned entities 
in  headwaters acquired certain assets of scp and assumed all of scp s outstanding debt 
headwaters agreed to pay an earn out to the sellers if certain earnings targets are exceeded during the months ending december  the earn out period 
the additional earn out consideration will be the product of times the amount that earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of scp exceed million during the earn out period 
headwaters currently expects earn out consideration in the range of approximately million to million could be paid  depending on performance 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  in september  headwaters purchased a variable interest in an entity that owns and operates a coal based solid alternative fuel production facility  where headwaters is not the primary beneficiary 
in december  headwaters purchased an additional variable interest in this entity 
headwaters minority interest was acquired in exchange for initial cash payments totaling million and an obligation to pay million in monthly installments from october through december this obligation  recorded in other accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet totaling million at september   bears interest at an rate 
headwaters also agreed to make additional payments to the seller based on a pro rata allocation of the tax credits generated by the facility  also through december these additional contractual payments  along with the amortization of the million investment  are recorded in other expense in the consolidated statement of income 
the alternative fuel produced at the facility through december qualifies for tax credits pursuant to section of the internal revenue code  and headwaters is entitled to receive its pro rata share of such tax credits generated 
the irs has issued a private letter ruling to the owners of the facility 
headwaters has the ability  under certain conditions  to limit its liability under the fixed payment obligations currently totaling million  therefore  headwaters obligation to make all of the above described payments is effectively limited to the tax benefits headwaters receives 
in  headwaters entered into an agreement with degussa ag  an international chemical company based in germany  to jointly develop and commercialize a process for the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide 
under terms of the joint venture agreement  headwaters paid million for its investment in the joint venture in  an additional million in october and is further obligated to pay million in headwaters has also committed to fund of the joint venture s research and development expenditures  currently limited to euro million  through september  of which approximately euro million approximately million remains to be paid as of september  although there is no legal obligation to do so  the joint venture partners currently have long range plans to eventually invest in large scale hydrogen peroxide plants using the process for direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide 
financing activities 
due to the issuance of senior debt in september and the covenants associated with that debt  as described below  headwaters currently has limited ability to obtain significant additional amounts of long term debt 
however  headwaters has experienced strong positive cash flow from operations and has issued common stock which together has enabled headwaters to repay a substantial amount of its long term debt prior to the scheduled maturities 
headwaters expects its strong positive cash flow to continue in the future and also has the ability to access the equity markets 
headwaters has an effective universal shelf registration statement on file with the sec that can be used for the sale of approximately million of common stock  preferred stock  convertible debt and other securities 
a prospectus supplement describing the terms of any securities to be issued is required to be filed before any future offering would commence under the registration statement 
senior secured credit agreements in september  headwaters entered into two credit agreements with a syndication of lenders 
the credit agreements have since been amended  most recently in october a total of million was originally borrowed under the credit facility  which also provides for up to million of borrowings under a revolving credit arrangement 
the original proceeds were used to acquire tapco and repay in full the remaining balance due under headwaters former senior secured credit agreement executed in march the million of borrowings consisted of a first lien term loan in the amount of million and a second lien term loan in the amount of million 
as of september   the second lien term loan has been repaid in its entirety 
with certain limited exceptions  the first lien term loan is secured by all assets of headwaters and is senior in priority to all other debt except for the specific scp assets that collateralize the notes payable to banks discussed below 
the terms of the credit facility  as amended  are described in more detail in the following paragraphs 
the first lien term loan bears interest  at headwaters option  at either i the london interbank offered rate libor plus   or  depending on the credit ratings that have been most recently announced for the loans by standard poors ratings services s p and moody s investors service  inc moody s  or ii the base rate plus   or  again depending on the credit ratings announced by s p and moody s 
base rate is defined as the higher of the rate announced by morgan stanley senior funding and the overnight rate charged by the federal reserve bank of new york plus 
the initial interest rate on the first lien debt was set at  but was subsequently reduced to approximately during the quarter ended december  pursuant to the terms of the agreement 
the interest rate on the first lien debt was approximately at september  the second lien term loan bore interest  also at headwaters option  at either libor plus  or the base rate plus 
the initial interest rate on the second lien debt was set at  but was subsequently reduced to approximately during the quarter ended december  pursuant to the terms of the agreement 
headwaters can lock in new libor rates for the first lien loan for one  two  three or six months 
the most recent rate change occurred in october the first lien term loan million outstanding at september  is repayable in quarterly installments of principal and interest  with minimum required quarterly principal repayments of approximately million commencing in november through august  with three repayments of approximately million each from november through april  the termination date 
interest is generally due on a quarterly basis 
during  headwaters repaid a total of million of the first lien term loan and all of the second lien term loan million 
as a result of the early repayments  accelerations of amortization of the related debt issue costs totaling approximately million were charged to interest expense 
prepayment penalties totaling million were paid related to the early repayments of the second lien term debt  which amount was also charged to interest expense 
there are mandatory prepayments of the first lien term loan in the event of certain asset sales and debt and equity issuances and from excess cash flow  as defined in the agreement 
optional prepayments of the first lien term loan are generally permitted without penalty or premium  except where the proceeds for repayment are obtained from a financing  as defined  consummated for the purpose of lowering the interest rate on the first lien debt  in which case there is a prepayment penalty 
optional prepayments of the second lien term were restricted and required prepayment penalties ranging up to of the prepayments made in the first year and in the second year 
once repaid in full or in part  no further reborrowings under either of the term loan arrangements can be made 
as required by the senior secured credit facility  headwaters entered into certain other agreements to limit its variable interest rate exposure 
the first set of agreements effectively established the maximum libor rate for million subsequently reduced to million of the senior secured debt at through september  the second set of agreements effectively set the libor rate at for million million as of september  of this debt for the period commencing september  through september  during  headwaters reduced the amount of senior debt hedged from million to million  as allowed under terms of the amended credit facility  and recognized a gain of approximately million  which was recorded as a reduction in interest expense 
headwaters accounts for the agreements which limit its variable interest rate exposure as cash flow hedges  and accordingly  the fair market value of the hedges is reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as either other assets or other liabilities 
the market value of the hedges can fluctuate significantly over a relatively short period of time 
the hedges had a market value at september  of approximately million  which  net of million of income taxes  represents other comprehensive income for total comprehensive income was approximately million for total comprehensive income did not differ from net income in or convertible senior subordinated notes in connection with the eldorado acquisition  headwaters issued million of convertible senior subordinated notes due these notes are subordinate to the senior secured debt described above 
holders of the notes may convert the notes into shares of headwaters common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount conversion price  or million aggregate shares of common stock  contingent upon certain events 
the conversion rate adjusts for events related to headwaters common stock  including common stock issued as a dividend  rights or warrants to purchase common stock issued to all holders of headwaters common stock  and other similar rights or events that apply to all holders of common stock 
the notes are convertible if any of the following five criteria are met satisfaction of a market price condition which becomes operative if  prior to june  and at any time after that date  in any calendar quarter the closing price of headwaters common stock exceeds per share for at least trading days in the consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter  a credit rating  if any  assigned to the notes is three or more rating subcategories below the initial rating  if any  the notes trade at less than of the product of the common stock trading price and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of  principal amount of the notes  except this provision is not available if the closing common stock price is between and of the current conversion price of the notes  headwaters calls the notes for redemption  and certain corporate transactions occur  including distribution of rights or warrants to all common stockholders entitling them to purchase common stock at less than the current market price or distribution of common stock  cash or other assets  debt securities or certain rights to purchase securities where the distribution has a per share value exceeding of the closing common stock price on the day immediately preceding the declaration date for such distribution 
in addition  the notes are convertible if headwaters enters into an agreement pursuant to which headwaters common stock would be converted into cash  securities or other property 
headwaters may call the notes for redemption at any time on or after june  and prior to june  if the closing common stock price exceeds of the conversion price for trading days in any consecutive day trading period in which case headwaters must provide a make whole payment of the present value of all remaining interest payments on the redeemed notes through june  
in addition  the holder of the notes has the right to require headwaters to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on june  or if a fundamental change in common stock has occurred  including termination of trading 
subsequent to june   the notes require an additional interest payment equal to of the average trading price of the notes if the trading price equals or more of the principal amount of the notes 
headwaters has included the additional shares of common stock contingently issuable under the notes in its diluted eps calculations on an if converted basis  as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
notes payable to a bank in connection with the acquisition of scp in july  headwaters assumed scp s obligations under its notes payable to a bank 
the notes require monthly interest and quarterly principal payments and bear interest at variable rates  which as of september   ranged from to 
because the notes are callable by the bank  headwaters has included the outstanding balance in current portion of long term debt in the consolidated balance sheet 
the notes are collateralized by certain assets of scp and contain financial covenants specific to scp  including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a leverage ratio requirement  and limitations on capital expenditures 
headwaters is in compliance with all debt covenants as of september  options and employee stock purchases in  cash proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchases totaled million  compared to million of proceeds in option exercise activity is largely dependent on headwaters stock price and is not predictable 
to the extent non qualified stock options are exercised  or there are disqualifying dispositions of shares obtained upon the exercise of incentive stock options  headwaters receives an income tax deduction generally equal to the income recognized by the optionee 
such amounts  reflected in cash flows from operations in and in cash flows from financing activities in in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
r in the consolidated statements of cash flows  were million in and million in these income tax deductions do not affect income tax expense or the effective income tax rate  rather they are reflected as increases in capital in excess of par value in the consolidated balance sheet 
working capital 
in  headwaters working capital increased by million  to million as of september  headwaters expects operations to produce positive cash flows in future periods 
additionally  headwaters will receive more than million in january as part of the settlement of the ajg litigation see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of all of these factors  headwaters expects working capital will be sufficient for operating needs for the next months 
long term debt 
due to the september issuance of senior debt and the covenants associated with that debt  as described below  headwaters currently has limited ability to obtain significant additional amounts of long term debt 
however  as provided for in the senior debt agreements  headwaters has available million under a revolving credit arrangement 
borrowings under the revolving credit arrangement are generally subject to the terms of the first lien loan agreement and bear interest at either libor plus to depending on headwaters total leverage ratio  as defined  or the base rate plus to 
borrowings and reborrowings of any available portion of the million revolver can be made at any time through september  when all loans must be repaid and the revolving credit arrangement terminates 
the fees for the unused portion of the revolving credit arrangement range from to depending on headwaters total leverage ratio  as defined 
as of september   headwaters had million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit arrangement 
because headwaters intent was to repay the outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit arrangement within months  this amount is reflected as current in the consolidated balance sheet as of september  the credit agreement also allows for the issuance of letters of credit  provided there is capacity under the revolving credit arrangement 
as of september   six letters of credit totaling million were outstanding  with expiration dates ranging from january to december subsequent to september   an additional letter of credit was issued in the amount of million  expiring in october headwaters may  in the future  make optional prepayments of the senior debt depending on actual cash flows  headwaters current and expected cash requirements and other applicable factors deemed significant by management 
the credit agreements contain restrictions and covenants common to such agreements  including limitations on the incurrence of additional debt  investments  merger and acquisition activity  asset sales and liens  annual capital expenditures in excess of million for  million for and million for through  and the payment of dividends  among others 
in addition  headwaters must maintain certain leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios  as those terms are defined in the agreements 
under the most restrictive covenants  contained in the first lien agreement  headwaters must maintain i a total leverage ratio of or less  declining periodically to in  ii a maximum ratio of consolidated senior funded indebtedness minus subordinated indebtedness to ebitda of  declining periodically to in  and iii a minimum ratio of ebitda plus rent payments for the four preceding fiscal quarters to scheduled payments of principal and interest on all indebtedness for the next four fiscal quarters of through september   and thereafter 
headwaters is in compliance with all debt covenants as of september  as described above  headwaters has approximately million of variable rate long term debt outstanding as of september   consisting of million of senior debt and million of notes payable to a bank 
considering all outstanding balances of variable rate debt reduced by the million of senior debt that effectively has a fixed interest rate until september  and required principal repayments  a change in the interest rate of would change headwaters interest expense by approximately million during the months ending september  income taxes 
as discussed previously  cash payments for income taxes are reduced for tax deductions resulting from disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options and from the exercise of non qualified stock options  which reduction totaled million in headwaters cash requirements for income taxes are expected to generally approximate the income tax provision 
there is some lag in paying estimated taxes during a fiscal year due to the seasonality of operations and because estimated income tax payments are typically based on annualizing the fiscal year s income based on year to date results 
there is also some lag in realizing the cash benefits from the utilization of tax credits due to the interaction of headwaters september fiscal year end and the different fiscal year ends of the entities through which headwaters receives the tax credits 
headwaters effective income tax rate for was approximately 
this compares to an effective tax rate of approximately for the primary reason for the decrease in the effective tax rate is the federal income tax credits available as a result of headwaters investment in an entity that owns and operates a coal based solid alternative fuel production facility see note to the consolidated financial statements  as well as headwaters ownership of two other alternative fuel production facilities that began operating in the alternative fuel produced at these three facilities through december qualifies for tax credits pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
excluding the effect of the tax credits  headwaters effective tax rate in would have been approximately 
summary of future cash requirements 
significant future cash uses  in addition to operational working capital requirements  are currently expected to consist primarily of debt service payments on outstanding long term debt  capital expenditures and income taxes 
off balance sheet arrangements although headwaters has operating leases for certain facilities and equipment  and hedge agreements to limit its exposure to interest rate increases  headwaters does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on its financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources that are material to investors 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the following table presents a summary of headwaters contractual obligations by period as of september  payments due by fiscal year after in millions total senior secured debt convertible senior subordinated notes other long term debt total long term debt interest payments on long term debt operating lease obligations unconditional purchase obligations investment and joint venture obligations capital expenditures other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations as provided for in the senior debt agreements  headwaters has available million under a revolving credit arrangement 
borrowings and reborrowings of any available portion of the million revolver can be made at any time through september  when all loans must be repaid and the revolving credit arrangement terminates 
as of september   headwaters had million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit arrangement 
the credit agreement allows for the issuance of letters of credit  provided there is capacity under the revolving credit arrangement 
as of september   six letters of credit totaling million were outstanding  with expiration dates ranging from january to december subsequent to september   an additional letter of credit was issued in the amount of million  expiring in october in  headwaters acquired certain assets of scp and assumed all of scp s outstanding debt 
headwaters agreed to pay an earn out to the sellers if certain earnings targets are exceeded during the months ending december  the earn out period 
the additional earn out consideration will be the product of times the amount that earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of scp exceed million during the earn out period 
headwaters currently expects earn out consideration in the range of approximately million to million could be paid  depending on performance 
subsequent to september   tapco acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of max manufacturing roofing  llc 
total consideration  including potential future deferred payments  is not material 
headwaters has ongoing litigation and asserted claims which have been incurred during the normal course of business  including the items discussed below and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
headwaters intends to vigorously defend or resolve these matters by settlement  as appropriate 
management does not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on headwaters operations  cash flows or financial position 
in  headwaters incurred approximately million of expense for legal matters  exclusive of costs for outside legal counsel 
this amount includes accruals for or payments made relating to settlements achieved  plus headwaters estimates of the probable liability for unresolved matters  giving consideration in certain instances to amounts for which headwaters is willing to settle 
headwaters currently believes the range of potential loss for unresolved matters  excluding costs for outside counsel  is from million up to the amounts sought by claimants and has recorded a total liability as of september  of million 
claims and damages sought by claimants in excess of this amount are not deemed to be probable 
our outside counsel currently believe that unfavorable outcomes of outstanding litigation are neither probable nor remote and declined to express opinions concerning the likely outcomes or liability to headwaters 
the matters discussed in note raise difficult and complex legal and factual issues  and the resolution of these issues is subject to many uncertainties  including the facts and circumstances of each case  the jurisdiction in which each case is brought  and the future decisions of juries  judges  and arbitrators 
therefore  although management believes that the claims asserted against headwaters in the named cases lack merit  there is a possibility of material losses in excess of the amounts accrued if one or more of the cases were to be determined adversely against headwaters for a substantial amount of the damages asserted 
therefore  it is possible that a change in the estimates of probable liability could occur  and the changes could be material 
additionally  as with any litigation  these proceedings require that headwaters incur substantial costs  including attorneys fees  managerial time  and other personnel resources and costs in pursuing resolution 
costs paid to outside legal counsel for litigation  which have historically comprised the majority of headwaters litigation related costs  totaled approximately million in  million in and million in exclusive of a reimbursement of legal costs in for approximately million received in connection with the ajg litigation settlement discussed below 
it is not possible to estimate what litigation related costs will be in future periods 
in december  headwaters entered into a technology license and proprietary chemical reagent sale agreement with ajg financial services  inc the agreement provided for ajg to pay royalties and allowed ajg to purchase proprietary chemical reagent material from headwaters 
in october  headwaters filed a complaint in the fourth district court for the state of utah against ajg alleging that it had failed to make payments and to perform other obligations under the agreement 
headwaters asserted claims including breach of contract and sought money damages as well as other relief 
ajg s answer to the complaint denied headwaters claims and asserted counter claims based upon allegations of misrepresentation and breach of contract 
this litigation came to the trial phase in january the jury reached a verdict substantially in favor of headwaters and the court entered a judgment for headwaters against ajg in the amount of approximately million which included approximately million in prejudgment interest 
in may  headwaters and ajg entered into a settlement agreement which provided for payments to headwaters in the amount of million at the time of settlement which payment was received in may  million related to a contract modification for use of technology in january  and certain quarterly payments based upon tax credits associated with ajg s facilities for calendar years through payments based upon tax credits associated with ajg s facilities for the first three quarters of calendar year are expected to be received in january  with all other quarterly payments for through payable days after the end of each quarter 
payments based upon tax credits for through are subject to downward adjustment or elimination if a phase out of section tax credits occurs due to high oil prices 
headwaters recognized the million contract litigation settlement gain  net of payments due to a third party  as a reduction in operating costs and expenses in the quarter ended june  the million  net of payments due to a third party  is being recognized as revenue over calendar years through the ongoing quarterly payments based upon tax credits are being recognized as revenue in accordance with headwaters revenue recognition policy for license fee revenue 
in connection with the settlement of the ajg litigation  headwaters also recognized as revenue approximately million of revenue from a licensee with an indirect interest in that litigation  all of which related to periods prior to january  ongoing revenue from this licensee is also being recognized in accordance with headwaters revenue recognition policy for license fee revenue 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  in  in conjunction with the gain recognized from the ajg litigation settlement  the compensation committee of the board of directors committee granted to certain officers and employees stock incentive awards consisting of sars and stock options 
the committee also approved the acceleration of vesting of certain outstanding stock options and the payment of incentive cash bonuses totaling approximately million  which were paid in the stock incentive awards were intended to accelerate approximately five years of long term incentive compensation into a significant portion of the awards is based on the achievement of performance criteria related to the economic growth eva of headwaters  which the committee believes would lead to the creation of significant long term stockholder value 
in addition to the above actions  the committee also authorized the grant of performance unit awards  to be settled in cash  based on performance criteria tied to the economic value created or preserved by one of headwaters business units after december the grants of performance units were not made until november and could result in the payments to employees of a maximum amount of approximately million if all performance criteria are met 
section matters headwaters energy services license fees and revenues from sales of chemical reagents depend on the ability of licensees and customers to manufacture and sell qualified synthetic fuels that generate tax credits under section of the internal revenue code 
from time to time  issues arise as to the availability of tax credits  including the items discussed below 
legislation 
under current law  section tax credits for synthetic fuel produced from coal expire on december  in addition  there have been initiatives from time to time to consider the early repeal or modification of section most recently  in april  an amendment to section was proposed in the house ways and means committee of the united states house of representatives that would have repealed the section credit for synthetic fuel produced from coal 
the committee failed to approve the proposed amendment  but the amendment or other similar legislation could be reintroduced 
if section expires at the end of or if it is repealed or adversely modified  synthetic fuel facilities would probably either close or substantially curtail production 
at this time  given current prices of coal and costs of synthetic fuel production  headwaters does not believe that production of synthetic fuel will be profitable absent the tax credits 
in addition  if headwaters licensees close their facilities or materially reduce production activities whether after  or upon earlier repeal or adverse modification of section  or for any other reason  it would have a material adverse effect on the revenues and net income of headwaters 
phase out 
section tax credits are subject to phase out after the average annual wellhead domestic oil price reference price reaches a beginning phase out threshold price  and are eliminated entirely if the reference price reaches the full phase out price 
for calendar  the reference price was per barrel and the phase out range began at and would have fully phased out tax credits at per barrel 
for calendar  through august   the average reference price is per barrel  and an estimate of the phase out range computed by increasing the inflation adjustment factor by begins at and completes phase out at per barrel 
in an environment of high oil prices  the risk of phase out increases 
headwaters customers and licensees will make their own assessments of phase out risk 
if customers and licensees perceive a potential negative impact from phase out  they may reduce or stop synthetic fuel production or require headwaters to share in the costs associated with phase out 
these events may materially adversely affect headwaters future revenue and net income 
irs audits 
licensees are subject to audit by the irs 
the irs may challenge whether headwaters energy services licensees satisfy the requirements of section  or applicable private letter rulings  including placed in service requirements  or may attempt to disallow section tax credits for some other reason 
the irs has initiated audits of certain licensee taxpayers who claimed section tax credits  and the outcome of any such audits is uncertain 
the inability of a licensee to claim section tax credits would reduce headwaters future income from the licensee 
senate permanent subcommittee on investigations 
on october   the permanent subcommittee on investigations of the government affairs committee of the united states senate issued a notification of pending investigations 
the notification listed the synthetic fuel tax credit as a new item 
in march  the subcommittee described its investigation as follows the subcommittee is continuing its investigation 
of 
tax credits claimed under section of the internal revenue code for the sale of coal based synthetic fuels 
this investigation is examining the utilization of these tax credits  the nature of the technologies and fuels created  the use of these fuels  and others 
sic 
aspects of section the investigation will also address the irs administration of section tax credits 
the subcommittee conducted numerous interviews and received large volumes of data between december and march since that time  to headwaters knowledge  there has been little activity regarding the investigation 
headwaters cannot make any assurances as to the timing or ultimate outcome of the subcommittee investigation  nor can headwaters predict whether congress or others may conduct investigations of section tax credits in the future 
the subcommittee investigation may have a material adverse effect on the willingness of buyers to engage in transactions to purchase synthetic fuel facilities or on the willingness of current owners to operate their facilities  and may materially adversely affect headwaters revenues and net income 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and spoilage  requiring that such costs be recognized as current period costs regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal  currently required by the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june   which for headwaters is fiscal because the provisions of this standard must be applied prospectively  there will be no effect on previously issued financial statements 
it is not possible to predict the effect sfas no 
might have on future reported results because it will depend on the levels of abnormal inventory costs incurred in the future  if any 
headwaters has reviewed all other recently issued accounting standards which have not yet been adopted in order to determine their potential effect  if any  on the results of operations or financial position of headwaters 
based on that review  headwaters does not currently believe that any of these other recent accounting pronouncements will have a significant effect on its current or future financial position  results of operations  cash flows or disclosures 
risks relating to our business section of the internal revenue code section tax credits are subject to phase out if the unregulated average annual oil price reaches per barrel in calendar tax credits claimed by an alternative fuel facility operator may begin to be phased out or eliminated prior to their scheduled expiration on december  if the reference price of oil exceeds an average annual range of oil prices  adjusted annually for inflation 
in april of each year  the internal revenue service irs announces the phase out range of oil prices for the prior tax year 
for example  in april  the irs announced that the phase out range for began at per barrel and ended with a tax credit at per barrel 
because the calendar year average oil price did not fall within the range  there was not a phase out of the credit for qualified fuel sold in based upon oil prices as of the date hereof  headwaters does not believe that there will be any phase out of section tax credits for calendar however  it is not possible to predict whether oil prices for calendar might result in a tax credit phase out in calendar if the section tax credits are phased out in whole or in material part  hes profitability will be severely affected 
the reference price of oil and the inflation adjustment factor iaf are determined annually and released in the first week of april for the previous year  while the predetermined oil price range is fixed  but adjusted annually for inflation 
the reference price of oil is defined as the annual average wellhead price per barrel for all domestic crude oil not subject to regulation by the united states 
tax credits are usually claimed by corporations according to the tax year in which the alternative fuel is actually produced and sold  which may be different than the calendar year 
since the government updates phase out criteria each april for alternative fuel produced during the previous calendar year  it is possible that the price of oil could impact the decisions of facility owners to continue alternative fuel production beginning with the first quarter of calendar year during  uncertainties surrounding crude oil production from foreign sources  growing concerns of remaining world oil reserves  and weather  among other things  have resulted in annual average oil prices that approach the lower threshold of the phase out range 
headwaters licensees and customers continue to closely watch oil price trends and will consider whether or not to operate their facilities in depending upon their view of future oil prices 
some facility owners have attempted to protect their positions by purchasing oil futures hedges and requiring that headwaters share the cost of such hedges  while others have considered these actions too risky and expensive  and may elect to simply curtail or eliminate production should high oil prices indicate phase out likelihood 
decisions by headwaters licensees or customers to curtail or eliminate production will severely affect our profitability 
a significant increase in the price of petrochemical feedstocks used to make latex materials which are in turn used in the production of headwaters energy services reagents that cannot be passed on to customers could have a significant adverse effect on net income 
further  headwaters energy services depends upon a single supplier for the production of reagents  the interruption of which would materially disrupt headwaters energy services ability to supply products to its customers  resulting in lost revenues and the potential loss of customers 
hes reagents  which provide a majority of hes revenues  are manufactured from latex by a single supplier  dow reichhold llc 
the price of latex is primarily a function of manufacturing capacity  demand and the prices of petrochemical feedstocks  crude oil and natural gas liquids 
historically  the market price of latex has fluctuated  and significantly increased in further significant increases in the price of latex that cannot be passed on to customers could have a significant adverse effect on our net income 
hes does not inventory reagents for sale to customers and alternative sources meeting hes requirements would be difficult to arrange 
therefore  hes ability to provide reagents to its customers could be materially disrupted if the supply of reagents or feedstock latex materials were interrupted for any reason 
such an interruption and the resulting inability to supply hes customers with reagents could adversely impact hes revenues and potentially our relationships with hes customers 
if the tax credits under section of the internal revenue code are repealed or adversely modified  headwaters energy services profitability will be severely affected 
hes license fees and revenues from sales of chemical reagents depend on the ability of our licensees and customers to manufacture and sell qualified alternative fuels that generate tax credits 
under current law  section tax credits are not available for alternative fuel sold after december  in addition  there have been initiatives from time to time to consider the early repeal or modification of section for example  in february  a bill was reintroduced in the united states house of representatives that would repeal the section credit for alternative fuel produced from coal 
if section expires at the end of or if it is repealed or adversely modified  alternative fuel facilities would probably either close or substantially curtail production 
at this time  given current prices of coal and costs of alternative fuel production  we do not believe that production of alternative fuel will be profitable absent the tax credits 
in addition  if our licensees close their facilities or materially reduce production activities whether after  upon earlier repeal or adverse modification of section or for any other reason  it would have a material adverse effect on the revenues and net income of headwaters 
if our licensees demand for section tax credits decreases  headwaters energy services revenues will decrease 
hes business depends upon the ability of our licensees and chemical reagent customers to utilize section tax credits as payments under our contracts are ultimately based on our customers production of alternative fuels 
their ability to utilize tax credits depends upon their taxable income 
a decline in the profitability of our licensees could reduce their ability to utilize tax credits  and  in turn  could lead to a reduction in the production of alternative fuel at their facilities 
such licensees could sell their facilities to a taxpayer with more capacity to utilize the tax credits  but any such transfer could result in short term or long term disruption of operations  and therefore adversely affect our revenues and net income 
irs reviews under section may adversely affect our licensees production of alternative fuel and therefore may adversely affect headwaters energy services profitability 
the issuance of private letter rulings plrs under section by the irs is important to the willingness of the owners of alternative fuel facilities to operate and to their ability to transfer ownership of those facilities 
however  plrs may be modified or revoked by the irs 
the irs has suspended the issuance of plrs to alternative fuel facility owners several times in the past  including most recently in  and the irs may suspend the issuance of plrs in the future 
in  following an irs announcement that it would suspend issuance of plrs because it questioned the scientific validity of procedures and tests performed by alternative fuel facility operators to determine that the fuel satisfied the requirements of section  certain of headwaters licensees reduced or ceased production  which resulted in a material impact on headwaters revenue and net income 
while the irs later indicated it would resume the issuance of plrs  it has continued to express concerns regarding the sampling and data record retention practices prevalent in the alternative fuels industry and subsequent plrs have required taxpayers i to maintain sampling and quality control procedures that conform to american society for testing and materials or other appropriate industry guidelines at the alternative fuel facilities  ii to obtain regular reports from independent laboratories that have analyzed the fuel produced in such facilities to verify that the coal used to produce the fuel undergoes a significant chemical change and iii to maintain records and data underlying the reports that taxpayers obtain from independent laboratories including raw fourier transform infrared ftir data and processed ftir data sufficient to document the selection of absorption peaks and integration points 
the expression of irs concern regarding current practices in the industry may adversely affect the willingness of buyers to engage in transactions or on the willingness of current owners to operate their facilities 
if current owners are unable to sell their facilities or are unwilling to operate them  production will not be maximized  thereby materially decreasing our revenues and net income 
we cannot predict whether the irs may conduct reviews or investigations of section tax credits in the future  or whether the outcome of irs audits involving licensees would be favorable 
senate investigation of section tax credits may adversely affect production by our licensees and decrease the profitability of headwaters energy services 
on october   the permanent subcommittee on investigations of the government affairs committee of the united states senate the subcommittee issued a notification of pending investigations 
the notification listed  among others  the alternative fuel tax credit as a new item to be reviewed 
if the pending investigation or any future congressional action results in findings or announcements negative to the industry  it may adversely affect the willingness of buyers to engage in transactions to purchase alternative fuel facilities or the willingness of current owners to operate their facilities  which would have a direct  negative impact on our revenues and net income 
in july  the subcommittee described its investigation as follows the subcommittee is continuing its investigation 
of 
tax credits claimed under section of the internal revenue code for the sale of coal based synthetic fuels 
this investigation is examining the utilization of these tax credits  the nature of the technologies and fuels created  the use of these fuels  and others 
sic 
aspects of section the investigation will also address the irs administration of section tax credits 
the subcommittee conducted numerous interviews and received large volumes of data between december and march since that time  to our knowledge  there has been little activity regarding the investigation 
if the irs challenges or disallows section tax credits claimed by our licensees  headwaters energy services profitability may decrease because future production by these licensees may decrease 
licensees are subject to audit by the irs 
the irs may challenge whether hes licensees satisfy the requirements of section  or applicable plrs  including placed in service requirements  or may attempt to disallow section tax credits for some other reason 
the irs has initiated audits of certain licensee taxpayers who claimed section tax credits  and the outcome of any such audit is uncertain 
in  a licensee announced that irs field auditors issued a notice of proposed adjustment challenging the placed in service date of three of its alternative fuel facilities 
the licensee believes that the facilities meet the placed in service requirement  however  the timing and final results of the audit are unknown 
in the event that tax credits are disallowed  licensees may seek recovery from headwaters energy services for operational or other reasons  although we believe there would be no basis for such claims 
the inability of a licensee to claim section tax credits also would reduce our future revenue from the licensee 
in addition  irs audit activity may have adversely affected the willingness of buyers to engage in transactions to purchase alternative fuel facilities or on the willingness of current owners to operate their facilities 
if current owners are unable to sell their facilities or are unwilling to operate them at full capacity  production will not be maximized  which could have a significant negative effect on our revenues and net income 
if our licensees demand for section tax credits is adversely influenced by negative publicity involving the industry or transactions principally motivated by the reduction of taxes  headwaters energy services profitability will decrease 
there has been public scrutiny of section  by the media and by policymakers 
outside the section context  there has been increased public scrutiny of transactions motivated principally by the reduction of federal income taxes 
our licensees could determine that the risk of negative publicity or public scrutiny associated with the section tax credits exceeds the financial benefits from the utilization of the credits 
such licensees may seek to mitigate or eliminate such risk by reducing or ceasing production of alternative fuel or disposing of their facilities  resulting in short term or long term disruption of operations  in which case our revenues and profitability would decrease 
headwaters energy services revenues result from a small number of licensees and customers  so that any short term or long term decisions by one or a small number of licensees and customers to decrease or halt production would cause our profitability to decrease 
hes has licensed facilities using its coal based synthetic fuel technologies 
in addition  hes sells reagents used at approximately facilities owned by our licensees and other customers 
license fees and reagent sales accounted for approximately of our total revenues in the fiscal year ended september  and a higher percentage of our net income 
under current law  facilities must have been placed into service prior to july  to be eligible for section tax credits  so hes business primarily depends on existing licensees and chemical reagent customers 
if any of hes significant licensees or chemical reagent customers shuts down its facilities  operates its facilities at low production levels or sells its facilities resulting in short term or long term disruption of operations  our revenues and net income could be materially adversely affected 
hes licensees must address all operational issues including  but not limited to  feedstock availability  cost  moisture content  british thermal unit btu content  correct chemical reagent formulation and application  operability of equipment  product durability and overall costs of operations 
in some cases  licensees may be forced to relocate plants and enter into new strategic contracts to address marketing and operational issues 
licensee plant relocations disrupt production and delay generation of license fees paid to us 
the growth of hes revenues has depended in part on increased production over time of coal based solid alternative fuel by its licensees 
for the past several years  efficiencies in production and improvements in equipment and processes used at facilities have allowed increased production 
however  facilities may be at or near capacity which could limit future growth 
headwaters resources primarily sells fly ash for use in concrete  if use of fly ash does not increase  headwaters resources may not grow 
hri s growth has been and continues to be dependent upon the increased use of fly ash in the production of concrete 
hri s marketing initiatives emphasize the environmental  cost and performance advantages of replacing portland cement with fly ash in the production of concrete 
if hri s marketing initiatives are not successful  hri may not be able to sustain its growth 
if portland cement or competing replacement products are available at lower prices than fly ash  our sales of fly ash as a replacement for portland cement in concrete products could suffer  causing a decline in headwaters resources revenues and net income 
an estimated of hri s revenues for the fiscal year ended september  were derived from the sale of fly ash as a replacement for portland cement in concrete products 
at times  there may be an overcapacity of cement in regional markets  causing potential price decreases 
the markets for hri s products are regional  in part because of the costs of transporting ccps  and hri s business is affected by the availability and cost of competing products in the specific regions where it conducts business 
if competing products become available at prices equal to or less than fly ash  hri s revenues and net income could decrease 
because demand for ccps sold by headwaters resources is affected by fluctuations in weather and construction cycles  headwaters resources revenues and net income could decrease significantly as a result of unexpected or severe weather or slowdowns in the construction industry 
hri manages and markets ccps and uses ccps to produce construction materials 
utilities produce ccps year round 
in comparison  sales of ccps are generally keyed to construction market demands that tend to follow national trends in construction with predictable increases during temperate seasons and decreases during periods of severe weather 
hri s ccp sales have historically reflected these seasonal trends  with the largest percentage of total annual revenues being realized in the quarters ended june and september low seasonal demand normally results in reduced shipments and revenues in the quarters ended december and march the ccp industry is cyclical because of its dependence on building construction and highway construction  including infrastructure repair  and is also affected by changes in general and local economic conditions 
state construction budgets are affected adversely by economic downturns 
hri s sales could significantly decrease as a result of a downturn in the economy in one or more markets that it serves 
if headwaters resources coal fueled electric utility industry suppliers fail to provide headwaters resources with high value ccps on a timely basis  headwaters resources costs could increase and our growth could be hindered 
hri relies on the production of ccps by coal fueled electric utilities 
hri has occasionally experienced delays and other problems in obtaining high value ccps from its suppliers and may in the future be unable to obtain high value ccps on the scale and within the time frames required by hri to meet its customers needs 
if hri is unable to obtain ccps or if it experiences a delay in the delivery of high value or quality ccps  hri may be forced to incur significant unanticipated expenses to secure alternative sources or to otherwise maintain supply to its customers 
moreover  its revenues could be adversely affected if these customers choose to find alternatives to hri s products 
a significant increase in the price of materials used in the production of eldorado s products that cannot be passed on to customers could have a significant adverse effect on net income 
furthermore  eldorado depends upon limited sources for certain key production materials  the interruption of which would materially disrupt eldorado s ability to manufacture products and supply products to its customers  resulting in lost revenues and the potential loss of customers 
eldorado s manufacturing processes require key production materials including cement  oxides  packaging materials  and certain types of rubber based products 
the suppliers of these materials to eldorado may experience capacity or supply constraints in meeting market demand that limit eldorado s ability to obtain needed production materials on a timely basis or at expected prices 
eldorado has no long term contracts with suppliers 
eldorado does not currently maintain large inventories of production materials and alternative sources meeting eldorado s requirements could be difficult to arrange in the short term 
a significant increase in the price of these materials that cannot be passed on to customers could have a significant adverse effect on our net income 
additionally  eldorado s manufacturing and ability to provide products to its customers could be materially disrupted if this supply of materials was interrupted for any reason 
such an interruption and the resulting inability to supply eldorado s customers with products could adversely impact eldorado s revenues and potentially our relationships with eldorado s customers 
with our recent acquisitions of eldorado and tapco  headwaters construction materials has grown to be a significant part of our business and our future profitability is therefore increasingly dependent upon our operations in this industry segment 
in june  we acquired eldorado  and in september  we acquired tapco 
with the eldorado and tapco acquisitions  hcm has grown to be a significant part of our business 
this business unit produced approximately million in revenues or approximately of total revenue for fiscal year headwaters future profitability therefore is highly dependent upon its ability to operate successfully in this industry segment where our operations to date have not been significant to our total revenues 
tapco s and eldorado s growth require continued investment of capital 
if we cannot invest additional capital into tapco and eldorado  we may not be able to sustain or increase tapco s and eldorado s growth 
tapco and eldorado operations both require maintenance and growth capital 
current levels of capital expenditures may be insufficient to support and sustain tapco s and eldorado s growth 
our senior secured credit facilities limit capital expenditures for all of headwaters to approximately million for fiscal year we believe that we will need substantially all of this capital expenditure limitation in fiscal year for operation maintenance  growth of existing businesses  and new growth initiatives 
because tapco s and eldorado s markets are heavily dependent on the residential construction and remodeling market  tapco s and eldorado s revenues could decrease as a result of events outside our control that impact home construction and home improvement activity 
tapco s and eldorado s construction markets are seasonal 
the majority of their sales are in the residential construction market  which tends to slow down in the winter months 
if there is more severe weather than normal  an increase in interest rates  a limit on availability of credit for homeowners which results in a slowdown in new construction or remodeling and repair activities  or other events outside of our control  there may be a negative effect on tapco s and eldorado s revenues if they are not able to increase market share 
interruption of tapco s ability to immediately ship individual or custom product orders could harm tapco s reputation and result in lost revenues if customers turn to other sources for products 
tapco s construction materials business is highly dependent upon rapid shipments to contractors and distributors throughout the united states of individual orders  a large portion of which orders are manufactured upon demand to meet customer specifications 
if there is significant interruption of business at any of tapco s manufacturing plants or with tapco s computer systems that track customer orders and production  tapco is at risk of harming its reputation for speed and reliability with important customers and losing short term and long term revenues if these customers turn to other sources 
a significant increase in the price of petrochemical feedstocks used to make polypropylene which is in turn used in the production of tapco s products that cannot be passed on to customers could have a significant adverse effect on net income 
further  tapco depends upon a single source for polypropylene  the interruption of which would materially disrupt tapco s ability to manufacture products and supply products to its customers  resulting in lost revenues and the potential loss of customers 
certain of tapco s products  which provide a majority of tapco s revenues  are manufactured from polypropylene  which material is sold to tapco by a single supplier 
the price of polypropylene is primarily a function of manufacturing capacity  demand and the prices of petrochemical feedstocks  crude oil and natural gas liquids 
historically  the market price of polypropylene has fluctuated  and significantly increased in a significant increase in the price of polypropylene that cannot be passed on to customers could have a significant adverse effect on our net income 
there is no long term contract with tapco s polypropylene supplier 
tapco does not maintain large inventories of polypropylene and alternative sources meeting tapco s requirements could be difficult to arrange in the short term 
therefore  tapco s manufacturing and ability to provide products to its customers could be materially disrupted if this supply of polypropylene was interrupted for any reason 
such an interruption and the resulting inability to supply tapco s customers with products could adversely impact tapco s revenues and potentially our relationships with tapco s customers 
tapco s revenues would be materially adversely affected if it lost one or both of its two major customers 
two of tapco s customers together accounted for approximately of its revenues in its fiscal year ended september  there are no long term contracts in place with these customers 
accordingly  a loss of or significant decrease in demand from these customers would have a material adverse effect on tapco s business 
headwaters new businesses  processes and technologies may not be successfully developed  operated and marketed  which could affect our future profitability 
although headwaters has developed several new businesses  processes and technologies eg  ethanol  hc and dry coal cleaning  commercialization of these businesses and technologies are in early stages 
commercial success of these new businesses and technologies will depend on our ability to enter into agreements with customers  licensees and or joint venturers to further develop and provide adequate funding to commercialize the new businesses and technologies  as well as to develop markets for the products and technologies 
we may not be able to enter into these agreements and adequate funding may not be available to fully develop and successfully commercialize our new businesses and technologies 
further  we may not be able to profitably operate our new businesses or market our technologies or products produced from them 
headwaters technology innovation group is conducting business in china  where intellectual property and other laws  as well as business conditions  may leave our intellectual property  products and technologies vulnerable to duplication by competitors and create uncertainties as to our legal rights against such competitors actions 
hti has and is expected to continue to license or otherwise make its technology  including its nanotechnology and coal liquefaction technology  available to entities in china 
there is a risk that foreign intellectual property laws will not protect hti s intellectual property to the same extent as under united states laws  leaving us vulnerable to competitors who may attempt to copy our products  processes or technologies 
further  the legal system of china is based on statutory law 
under this system  prior court decisions may be cited as persuasive authority but do not have binding precedential effect 
since  the chinese government has been developing a comprehensive system of commercial laws and considerable progress has been made in the promulgation of laws and regulations dealing with economic matters  such as corporate organization and governance  foreign investment  commerce  taxation and trade 
as these laws  regulations and legal requirements are relatively new and because of the limited volume of published case law and judicial interpretations and the non binding nature of prior court decisions  the interpretation and enforcement of these laws  regulations and legal requirements involve some uncertainty 
these uncertainties could limit the legal protection or recourse available to us 
in addition  dependence on foreign licenses and conducting foreign operations may subject us to increased risk from political change  ownership issues or repatriation or currency exchange concerns 
significant increases in energy and transportation costs that cannot be passed on to customers could have significant adverse effect on net income 
we purchase a significant amount of energy from various sources to conduct our operations  including fossil fuels and electricity for production of building products and diesel fuel for distribution of our products and for production related vehicles 
in addition  fuel cost increases have increased truck and rail carrier transportation costs for our products 
fuel cost increases have in the past and may in the future adversely affect the results of our operations and our financial condition 
prices and availability of all petroleum products are subject to political  economic and market factors that are generally outside of our control 
we operate in industries subject to significant environmental regulation  and compliance with and changes in regulation could add significantly to the costs of conducting business 
the coal based solid alternative fuel operations of hes and the fly ash operations of hri and their respective customers and licensees are subject to federal  state and local environmental regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment  storage and disposal of waste products  which add to the costs of doing business and expose us to potential fines for non compliance 
if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason  we may not be able to pass on these costs to customers 
in order to establish and operate the alternative fuel plants  power plants and operations to collect and transport ccps and bottom ash  we  our licensees and customers have obtained various state and local permits and must comply with processes and procedures that have been approved by regulatory authorities 
any failure to comply could result in the issuance of substantial fines and penalties and cause us to incur environmental liabilities 
certain eldorado  southwest and tapco manufacturing operations are also subject to environmental regulations and permit requirements 
if eldorado  southwest and tapco cannot obtain or maintain required environmental permits for their existing and planned manufacturing facilities in a timely manner or at all  they may be subject to additional costs and or fines 
hti s ordinary course of business requires using its facilities to perform research and development activities involving coal  oil  chemicals and energy technologies  including liquefaction of coal 
as a result  petroleum and other hazardous materials have been and are present in and on hti s properties 
regulatory noncompliance or accidental discharges  fires  or explosions  in spite of safeguards  could create environmental or safety liabilities 
therefore  our operations entail risk of environmental damage and injury to people  and we could incur liabilities in the future arising from the discharge of pollutants into the environment  waste disposal practices  or accidents 
we are involved in litigation and claims for which we incur significant costs and are exposed to significant liability 
headwaters is a party to some significant legal proceedings and is subject to potential claims regarding operation of its business 
these proceedings will require that headwaters incur substantial costs  including attorneys fees  managerial time and other personnel resources and costs in pursuing resolution  and adverse resolution of these proceedings could hurt headwaters reputation 
with respect to the cases referred to in our item legal proceedings of this form k  the following amount of damages are being sought by the counter parties mcewan mcewan seeks declaratory relief as well as compensatory damages in the approximate amount of million plus punitive damages 
boynton boynton seeks declaratory relief as well as compensatory damages in the approximate amount of million plus punitive damages  headwaters has ongoing litigation and claims incurred during the normal course of business  including the items referred to above 
headwaters intends to vigorously defend and or pursue its rights in these actions 
we do not currently believe that the outcome of these actions will have a material adverse effect on headwaters operations  cash flows or financial position  however  it is possible that a change in the estimates of probable liability could occur  and the change could be significant 
we have significant competition in our industries which may cause demand for our products and services to decrease 
headwaters experiences significant competition in all of its segments and geographic regions 
a failure to compete effectively or increased competition could lead to price cuts  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  which could decrease our profitability 
many of our competitors have greater financial  management and other resources than us and may be able to take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities more readily 
in certain instances we must compete on the basis of superior products and services rather than price  thereby increasing the costs of marketing its services to remain competitive 
hes competes with other companies possessing technologies to produce coal based solid alternative fuels and companies that produce chemical reagents 
it also experiences competition from traditional coal and fuel suppliers and companies involved with natural resources  in addition to those companies that specialize in the use and upgrading of industrial byproducts 
these companies may have greater financial  management and other resources than we have and may develop superior  or more cost effective  technologies 
this could result in a decrease in market share and therefore revenues 
hri has substantial competition in two main areas obtaining ccp management contracts with utility and other industrial companies  and marketing ccps and related industrial materials 
there are many local  regional and national companies that compete for market share in these areas with similar products and with numerous other substitute products 
although hri typically has long term ccp management contracts with its clients  some of such contracts provide for the termination of such contracts at the convenience of the utility company upon a minimum day notice 
moreover  certain of hri s most significant regional ccp competitors appear to be seeking a broader national presence  and some of these competitors have substantially greater resources than headwaters and hri 
if they were to begin to compete in the national market  or in regions where they currently do not have operations  hri could lose market share and associated revenues 
hcm competes against numerous national and regional building products manufacturers  some of which are significantly larger than headwaters and may have greater financial  manufacturing and distribution resources than headwaters 
for the hti business  many of the world s major chemical companies are devoting significant resources to researching and developing nanocatalysts  catalytic processes  and coal to liquid processes 
these companies have greater financial  management and other resources than headwaters 
our business strategy to diversify and grow through acquisitions may result in integration costs  failures and dilution to existing stockholders 
an important business strategy of headwaters has been and continues to be diversification and growth through acquisitions 
our ability to successfully implement our strategy is subject to a number of risks  including difficulties in identifying acceptable acquisition candidates  consummating acquisitions on favorable terms and obtaining adequate financing  which may adversely affect our ability to develop new products and services and to compete in our markets 
in addition  if we consummate acquisitions through an exchange of our securities  our existing stockholders could suffer dilution 
if we do not successfully integrate newly acquired businesses with our existing businesses  we may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions  and the resources and attention required for successful integration may interrupt the business activities of acquired businesses and our existing businesses 
successful management and integration of acquisitions are subject to a number of risks  including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations  loss of key employees  diversion of management s attention from core business operations  assumption of contingent liabilities  incurrence of potentially significant write offs  and various employee issues  such as issues related to human resource benefit plans  and an increase in eeoc claims and claims for workers compensation 
each business acquisition also requires us to expand our operational and financial systems  which increases the complexity of our information technology systems 
implementation of controls  systems and procedures may be costly and time consuming and may not be effective 
this strategy may not improve our operating results and acquisitions may have a dilutive effect on existing stockholders 
if our internal controls over financial reporting under section of the sarbanes oxley act are not adequate  our reputation could be harmed and we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny  civil or criminal penalties or stockholder litigation 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls beginning with this annual report on form k 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny  civil or criminal penalties or stockholder litigation 
any inability to provide reliable financial reports could harm our business 
section of the sarbanes oxley act also requires that our independent auditors report on management s evaluation of our system of internal controls 
headwaters has documented and tested its system of internal controls to provide the basis for our report 
further  the growth and diversification of our business through acquisitions complicates the process of developing  documenting  maintaining and testing internal controls 
no assurance can be given that in the future there may not be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that would be required to be reported 
if we are unable to manage the growth of our business successfully  our revenues and business prospects could suffer 
we have experienced significant growth recently  both internally and through acquisitions 
we may not be able to successfully manage the increased scope of our operations or a significantly larger and more geographically diverse workforce as we expand 
any failure to successfully manage growth could harm our business and financial results 
additionally  growth increases the demands on our management  our internal systems  procedures and controls 
to successfully manage growth  we must add administrative staff and periodically update and strengthen our operating  financial and other systems  procedures and controls  which will increase our costs and may reduce our profitability 
we may be unable to successfully implement improvements to our information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing or future systems and controls 
unauthorized use of or infringement claims regarding our proprietary intellectual property could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 
we rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets  patents  copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our intellectual property 
despite these precautions  unauthorized third parties may misappropriate  infringe upon  copy or reverse engineer portions of our technology or products 
we do not know if current or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought  if at all  or whether any patents issued will be challenged or invalidated 
our business could be harmed if we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 
we have been  and may be in the future  notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by third parties 
if any such claims are asserted against us  we may seek to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
there is a risk in these situations that no license will be available or that a license will not be available on reasonable terms  precluding our use of the applicable technology 
alternatively  we may decide to litigate such claims or attempt to design around the patented technology 
to date  while no single patent or trademark is material to our business and the issues described in this paragraph have not resulted in significant cost or had an adverse impact on our business  future actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel 
our capital structure affects our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions and results in high interest costs 
as of september   we had approximately million of total debt outstanding  including million of senior indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities and million of our convertible senior subordinated notes the convertible notes 
subject to restrictions in our senior secured credit facility  we may also incur significant amounts of additional debt for working capital  capital expenditures and other purposes 
our combined debt total could have important consequences  including the following o we may have difficulty borrowing money for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes because of our existing debt load and because our borrowings are secured by all of our assets  o we will need to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay interest and the required principal payments on our debt  which will reduce the amount of money available to finance our operations  capital expenditures and other activities  and o over of our senior secured credit facilities has a variable rate of interest  which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates 
our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of  to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance  which to a certain extent is subject to economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures 
if unable to generate such cash flow  we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives  such as selling assets  restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive 
covenant restrictions under our senior secured credit facility may limit our ability to operate our business in a manner required to sustain profitability and generate growth 
our senior secured credit facilities  contain  among other things  covenants that may restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs  to acquire additional businesses or to engage in other business activities 
the senior secured credit facilities impose specified limitations on joint venture investments and new acquisitions 
in addition  our senior secured credit facilities set forth covenants requiring us to maintain specified financial ratios and to satisfy certain financial condition tests which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our senior secured credit facilities  in which event our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
if we are not able to repay our obligations when they become due or are accelerated  the lenders could foreclose on our assets 
the indenture for the notes does not restrict the amount of indebtedness  including senior indebtedness  that we may incur 
risks related to our common stock the price of our common stock historically has been volatile 
this volatility may affect the price at which you could sell your common stock  and the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
the market price for our common stock has varied between a high of in july and a low of in january in the twelve month period ended october  this volatility may affect the price at which you could sell your common stock  and the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors  including the other factors discussed in risks relating to our business  variations in our quarterly operating results from our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors  downward revisions in securities analysts estimates  and announcement by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of their stock  many companies have been the subject of securities class action litigation 
if we became involved in securities class action litigation in the future  it could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management s attention and resources and could harm our stock price  business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the broader stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years 
this volatility has affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
in addition  our announcements of our quarterly operating results  changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets and other developments affecting us  our affiliates or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely impact its price 
as of september   we had outstanding approximately million shares of our common stock and options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock of which approximately million were exercisable as of that date 
we also had outstanding approximately million stock appreciation rights as of september   of which approximately million were exercisable 
the sale or the availability for sale of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
conversion of the convertible notes may cause volatility in our stock price and will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders 
although our diluted earnings per share calculation treats the convertible notes as if they were already converted into common stock  sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
anticipated conversion of the notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 
in addition  the existence of the convertible notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could be used to satisfy short positions 
conversion of the convertible notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders  including holders who had previously converted their notes 
we have never paid dividends and do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the future  so any short term return on your investment will depend on the market price of our capital stock 
we currently intend to retain any earnings to finance our operations and growth 
the terms and conditions of our senior secured credit facility restrict and limit payments or distributions in respect of our capital stock 
delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover  which could cause the market price of our shares to decline 
we are a delaware corporation  and the anti takeover provisions of delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders 
in addition  our board of directors has the power  without stockholder approval  to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock  including the adoption of a poison pill  which could be used defensively if a takeover is threatened 
the ability of our board of directors to create and issue a new series of preferred stock and certain provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger  takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock  which  under certain circumstances  could reduce the market price of our common stock 
item a
