total growth in millions implantable defibrillator systems pacemaker systems coronary stent systems angioplasty systems cardiac surgery  biliary  peripheral and carotid systems sales guidant reported  million worldwide net sales for the year ended december   representing growth compared to growth in unit volume favorably impacted sales by  which was partially offset by a decrease in pricing 
the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by million or 
sales of products other than worldwide coronary stents grew million  an increase of compared to sales growth was driven by growth in implantable defibrillator system sales  which accounted for of guidant s worldwide sales 
this growth was partially offset by a decrease in coronary stent system sales primarily due to competitive drug eluting stents and increased competition from metallic coronary stent competitors in japan 
coronary stents comprised of company sales in  compared to in the prior year 
implantable defibrillator systems sales bar graph sales of implantable defibrillator systems include both sales of implantable cardioverter defibrillator icd and crt d systems 
worldwide sales of implantable defibrillator systems for were  million  up million or over growth was driven primarily by increased volume and a shift toward higher value crt d systems 
us implantable defibrillator system sales climbed to  million  while international sales of million were up over the prior year 
sales of implantable defibrillator systems increased due to the following increased awareness and adoption of icd and cardiac resynchronization therapies based on the following findings of two guidant sponsored clinical trials madit ii and companion 
madit ii demonstrated that a broader group of patients would benefit from icd therapy 
the investigators for the companion trial reported that for advanced heart failure patients with desynchronized heart contractions  the addition of resynchronization therapy to optimal drug treatment reduced the combination of death and hospitalization when compared with optimal drug treatment alone 
this trial demonstrated reduction in combined all cause death and hospitalization by adding guidant s crt d systems to optimal drug therapy and reduction in all cause mortality for guidant s crt d systems for patients with advanced heart failure 
based on the results of the companion trial  the fda approved an expanded indication for guidant crt d systems in september this approval could make crt d systems available to thousands more heart failure patients 
prior to this approval  a patient needed to be indicated for both an icd and resynchronization therapy in order to receive a crt d system 
this approval expands the labeling to all patients with moderate to severe heart failure with certain other patient conditions 
scd heft clinical trial and expanded national coverage 
the national heart  lung and blood institute s scd heft clinical trial was completed in with the clinical trial results published in the new england journal of medicine in january the results demonstrated positive benefits of implantable defibrillators reducing death by versus patients who did not receive defibrillators and only received standard drug therapy in patients with heart failure 
based on these results and other recent clinical trials  the centers for medicare medicaid services cms expanded national coverage to thousands of patients at risk for sudden cardiac death in january rapido advance tm delivery system and easytrak and easytrak leads  which received fda approval and were launched in august these products improve the physician s ability to implant leads to the desired location
