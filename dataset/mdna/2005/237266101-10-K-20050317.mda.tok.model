item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth in item of this report  under the heading risk factors in item a of this report  and elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this report 
the company is organized along two operating business segments 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
overview darling international inc is a recycler of food and animal by products and provides grease trap services to food service establishments 
the company collects and recycles animal by products and used cooking oil from food service establishments 
the company processes such raw materials at facilities located throughout the united states  into finished products such as protein primarily mbm  tallow primarily bft  and yg 
the company sells these products nationally and internationally  primarily to producers of oleo chemicals  soaps  pet foods  and livestock feed  for use as ingredients in their products or for further processing 
the company s operations are currently organized into two segments rendering and restaurant services 
for additional information on the company s business  see item  business  for additional information on the company s segments  see note  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
major challenges faced by the company during fiscal included reduced raw material supplies  lower finished product margins at the company s export locations  high relative prices for diesel fuel and natural gas  and increased administrative costs for compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of during fiscal  anticipated new government regulations pertaining to bse  were never implemented  which contributed to an environment of uncertainty regarding the impact of those anticipated regulations 
export markets in foreign countries for us produced finished beef products and other cattle by products were closed throughout fiscal the effects of these challenges during fiscal are summarized in the sections which follow 
while operating income increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  these challenges indicate there can be no assurance that operating results achieved by the company in fiscal are indicative of future operating performance of the company 
summary of critical issues faced by the company during fiscal lower raw material volumes were collected from suppliers during fiscal  as trends noted during the third quarter of fiscal continued to decline during the fourth quarter as well 
management believes that weak cattle slaughter margins in the meat processing industry  along with export restrictions on us beef products  contributed to a decline in red meat raw material volumes collected by the company during fiscal additionally  the company operated fifty two weeks during fiscal  compared to fifty three weeks of operations in fiscal  which also contributed to the decline in raw material volume from to the financial impact of lower raw material volumes on sales revenue and raw material cost is summarized below in results of operations 
the average price of the company s finished products was higher during the first  second and third quarters of fiscal compared to the same periods in fiscal  but began to decline in the third quarter and continued to decline during the fourth quarter of fiscal the average price of the company s finished products was lower in the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared to the same period in fiscal the average sales price of the company s finished goods for the full year in fiscal was slightly higher compared to the full year in fiscal management believes that closure of foreign export markets to us produced beef products resulted in lower commodity price premiums in the company s export locations  increased domestic supply of those finished products  primarily mbm  and forced the company to find new domestic markets for its finished products 
in prior years  the company received a premium to domestic commodity finished goods prices in certain of its export locations 
the ban on export markets of us produced beef products resulted in the loss of that price premium during fiscal the financial impact of finished goods prices on sales revenue and raw material cost is summarized below in results of operations 
comparative sales price information from the jacobsen index  an established trading exchange publisher used by management  is listed below in summary of key indicators 
page high energy prices for both natural gas and diesel fuel persisted throughout fiscal management believes that high prices were due in part to fears of potential natural gas shortages resulting from feared supply and demand imbalances  and from fears of potential crude oil shortages resulting from war in iraq and ongoing strife in the middle east 
the company attempts to manage natural gas price risk by entering into forward purchase agreements with all of its natural gas suppliers that permit such contracts  through the use of fixed for float swap agreements  in order to purchase natural gas for future months when prices are relatively low  and has the ability to burn alternate fuels at various plant locations when economically favorable to do so 
the company has limited diesel fuel storage capabilities at its plant locations and regional suppliers have not been willing to enter into forward purchase agreements on terms acceptable to the company 
the financial impact of higher natural gas and diesel fuel prices is summarized below in results of operations 
the company entered a new senior credit agreement with new lenders on april  the refinancing replaces the prior amended and restated credit agreement executed on may   as discussed elsewhere herein 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company concluded a settlement with certain past insurers on certain policies of insurance issued primarily before  whereby the company received a cash payment of approximately million in return for an executed settlement agreement and release in which the company released the participating insurers from all actual and potential claims and liability under the subject insurance policies 
the company recorded receipt of the payment as a credit recovery of claims expense and previous insurance premiums included in cost of sales and operating expenses  within the corporate segment 
during fiscal  the company incurred higher contract labor expense  consulting fees  and audit fees related to the company s efforts to comply with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of these expenses related to the company s documentation and evaluation of its system of internal controls in accordance with the requirements of the act 
summary of critical issues and known trends faced by the company in fiscal and thereafter a case of bse was diagnosed in a cow in the state of washington on december  a summary of the impact of this case of bse follows within days of the initial media reports of the case of bse  many countries banned imports of us produced beef and beef products  including meat and bone meal and initially tallow  though this initial ban on tallow was relaxed to permit imports of us produced tallow with less than impurities 
us government regulations issued in response to the case of bse include o on december   the secretary of agriculture announced new beef slaughter meat processing regulations to assure consumers of the safety of the meat supply 
the regulations prohibit non ambulatory animals from entering the food chain  require removal of srm at slaughter  and prohibit carcasses from cattle tested for bse from entering the food chain until the animals are shown negative for bse 
o on january   the fda announced intentions to modify its feed rule cfr by removing the exemptions for certain products  including blood and blood products  and requiring dedicated processing lines for handling and processing restricted use and exempted proteins 
on july   the fda requested public comment on their intended modifications to the feed rule as well as regulations that would prohibit material derived from srm and dead or non ambulatory cattle in animal feed  prohibit all animal proteins in feed for ruminant animals  and or require that only bft either derived from srm free material or containing less than impurities be allowed in animal feed 
only questions were posed in this announcement of proposed rulemaking  to which the company  among others  responded in comments submitted to the fda 
no new regulations affecting animal feed or modifying the feed rule have been issued to date 
this situation will likely continue to be fluid into on january   the fda announced its intent to ban the use of certain animal tissue derived materials in food and supplements 
subsequently  on july   the fda published regulations prohibiting srm from human food and cosmetics  and srm and non ambulatory or dead cattle from cosmetics 
bft that is either derived from srm free raw materials or contains less than hexane insoluble impurities will be permitted in human food  supplements and cosmetics 
derivatives of bft glycerin and fatty acids are exempt from these regulations 
on september   the fda issued guidance document  which cited the agency s statutory authority to consider animal feed and feed ingredients derived from a bse positive animal to be adulterated and prohibit the use of such adulterated material in animal feed 
page as a result of the bse case  many foreign countries closed their borders to us beef products  including mbm 
despite the mbm market price fluctuations that occurred during late december and january  management of the company did not believe it necessary to make significant changes in its fiscal business plan or daily operations and management of the company also considered these factors in developing its fiscal business plan 
the company s management monitors market conditions and prices for its finished products on a daily basis 
if market conditions or prices were to significantly change  the company s management would evaluate and implement such measures  if any  that it deems necessary to respond to the change in market conditions 
on larger formula based pricing suppliers  the indexing of finished product price to raw material cost effectively fixes the gross margin on finished product sales at a stable level  providing some protection to the company from finished product price declines 
management of the company believes raw material volumes collected by the company will continue to be subject to uncertainties during fiscal because of continued weak margins on cattle slaughter experienced by the meat processing industry resulting in reduced cattle slaughter and lower raw material volumes available to the company from its suppliers in the meat processing industry  and the potential impact of the planned opening of the us beef market to canadian imports of cattle on march   which was delayed indefinitely by a us federal court injunction issued in early march on january   aphis published a final rule  effective march   which amends regulations on the importation of animals and animal products and establishes minimal risk regions for bse 
canada was classified as a minimal risk region by this rulemaking  even though the canadian government confirmed two new cases of bse on january  and january   aphis considers canada to have adequate controls and safeguards in place and on march   planned to allow imports from canada of live cattle less than months of age for slaughter or as feeder cattle  as well as beef that is free of srm and derived from cattle under months of age 
imports of other live ruminant animals or meat derived from such animals that meet minimum age requirements were also to be allowed 
aphis banned imports of beef  live cattle  and other ruminant animals from canada on may   following the discovery of bse in a canadian born cow 
in early march  the planned opening of the us border to canadian cattle and beef products was delayed indefinitely by a us federal court injunction 
energy prices for natural gas and diesel fuel remain high into fiscal relative to historical pricing 
the company consumes significant volumes of natural gas to operate boilers in its plants to generate steam to heat raw material 
high natural gas prices represent a significant cost of factory operation included in cost of sales 
the company consumes significant volumes of diesel fuel to operate its fleet of tractors and trailers used to collect raw material 
high diesel fuel prices represent a significant component of cost of collection expenses included in cost of sales 
though the company will continue to manage these costs  energy prices remain relatively high into fiscal and represent an ongoing challenge to the company s operating results for future periods 
these challenges indicate there can be no assurance that operating results of the company in fiscal are indicative of future operating performance of the company

no assurance can be given that the minimum pension funding requirements will not increase in the future 
page the company s management believes that cash flows from operating activities at the current level in fiscal  unrestricted cash  and funds available under the credit agreement should be sufficient to meet the company s working capital needs and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
the impact on cash flows from operations in fiscal of the occurrence of bse in the united states or elsewhere  lower raw material volumes available to the company due to weak margins in the meat processing industry  regulations by government agencies  the impact on export markets  and the impact on market prices for the company s finished products is not known at this time 
these factors  coupled with high prices for natural gas and diesel fuel  among others  could either positively or negatively impact the company s results of operations in and thereafter 
the company cannot provide assurance that the cash flows from operating activities generated in fiscal are indicative of the future cash flows from operating activities which will be generated by the company s operations 
the company reviews the appropriate use of unrestricted cash periodically 
although no decision has been made as to non ordinary course cash usages at this time  potential usages could include opportunistic capital expenditures or investments in response to governmental regulations relating to bse  and or acquisitions  as well as suitable cash conservation to withstand adverse commodity cycles 
the current economic environment in the company s markets has the potential to adversely impact its liquidity in a variety of ways  including through reduced sales  potential inventory buildup  or higher operating costs 
the principal products that the company sells are commodities  the prices of which are quoted on established commodity markets and are subject to volatile changes 
although the current market prices of these commodities are favorable  a decline in these prices has the potential to adversely impact the company s liquidity 
a disruption in international sales  a decline in commodities prices  lower raw material volume  or a rise in energy prices resulting from the recent war with iraq and the subsequent political instability and uncertainty  has the potential to adversely impact the company s liquidity 
there can be no assurance that a decline in commodities prices  a rise in energy prices  a slowdown in the us or international economy  or other factors  including political instability in the middle east or elsewhere  and the macroeconomic effects of those events  will not cause the company to fail to meet management s expectations  or otherwise result in liquidity concerns

the company is not able to estimate pension funding requirements beyond the next twelve months 
the accrued pension benefit liability was approximately million at the end of fiscal page the company s off balance sheet contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january  relate to operating lease obligations  letters of credit  forward purchase agreements  and employment agreements 
the company has excluded these items from the balance sheet in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the following table summarizes the company s other commercial commitments  including both on and off balance sheet arrangements at january  other commercial commitments standby letters of credit  total other commercial commitments  off balance sheet obligations based upon underlying purchase agreements  the company has commitments to purchase million of finished products and natural gas during fiscal  which are not included in liabilities on the company s balance sheet at january  these purchase agreements are entered in the normal course of the company s business and are not subject to derivative accounting 
the commitments will be recorded on the balance sheet of the company when delivery of these commodities occurs and ownership passes to the company during fiscal  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
based upon underlying lease agreements  the company expects to pay approximately million in operating lease obligations during fiscal which are not included in liabilities on the company s balance sheet at january  these lease obligations are included in cost of sales or selling  general  and administrative expense as the underlying lease obligation comes due  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
critical accounting policies the company follows certain significant accounting policies when preparing its consolidated financial statements 
a complete summary of these policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
certain of the policies require management to make significant and subjective estimates or assumptions which may deviate from actual results 
in particular  management makes estimates regarding estimates of bad debt expense  valuation of inventories  estimates of useful life of long lived assets related to depreciation and amortization expense  estimates regarding fair value of the company s reporting units and future cash flows with respect to assessing potential impairment of both long lived assets and goodwill  estimates of liability with respect to medical insurance liability  self insurance  environmental  and litigation reserves  pension liability  estimates of income tax expense  and estimates of pro forma expense related to stock options granted 
each of these estimates is discussed in greater detail in the following discussion 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers non payment of trade accounts receivable owed to the company 
these trade receivables arise in the ordinary course of business from sales of raw material  finished product or services to the company s customers 
the estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the company s bad debt experience  prevailing market conditions  aging of trade accounts receivable  and interest rates  among other factors 
if the financial condition of the company s customers deteriorates  resulting in the customer s inability to pay the company s receivable as it comes due  additional allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
accounts receivable was approximately million and million  and the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million and million  at january  and january   respectively 
page inventories the company s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
finished product manufacturing cost is calculated using the first in  first out fifo method  based upon the company s raw material costs  collection and factory production operating expenses  and depreciation expense on collection and factory assets 
market values of inventory are estimated at each plant location  based upon either the backlog of unfilled sales orders at the balance sheet date  or for unsold inventory  upon regional finished product prices quoted in the jacobsen index at the balance sheet date 
estimates of market value  based upon the backlog of unfilled sales orders or upon the jacobsen index  assume that the inventory held by the company at the balance sheet date will be sold at the estimated market finished product sales price  subsequent to the balance sheet date 
actual sales prices received on future sales of inventory held at the end of a period may vary from either the backlog unfilled sales order price or the jacobsen index quotation at the balance sheet date 
such variances could cause actual sales prices realized on future sales of inventory to be different than the estimate of market value of inventory at the end of the period 
inventories were approximately million and million at january  and january   respectively 
long lived assets depreciation and amortization expense and valuation the company s property  plant and equipment are recorded at cost when acquired 
depreciation expense is computed on property  plant and equipment based upon a straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets  which is based upon a standard classification of the asset group 
buildings and improvements are depreciated over a useful life of to years  machinery and equipment are depreciated over a useful life of to years  and vehicles are depreciated over a life of to years 
these useful life estimates have been developed based upon the company s historical experience of asset life utility  and whether the asset is new or used when placed in service 
the actual life and utility of the asset may vary from this estimated life 
useful lives of the assets may be modified from time to time when the future utility or life of the asset is deemed to change from that originally estimated when the asset was placed in service 
depreciation expense was approximately million  million  and million in fiscal years ending january   january   and december   respectively 
the company s intangible assets  including routes  raw material supply agreements and non compete agreements are recorded at fair value when acquired 
amortization expense is computed on these intangible assets based upon a straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets  which is based upon a standard classification of the asset group 
collection routes are amortized over a useful life of to years  raw material supply agreements and non compete agreements are amortized over a useful life of to years 
the actual economic life and utility of the asset may vary from this estimated life 
useful lives of the assets may be modified from time to time when the future utility or life of the asset is deemed to change from that originally estimated when the asset was placed in service 
amortization expense was approximately million  million  and million in fiscal years ending january   january   and december   respectively 
the company reviews the carrying value of long lived assets on a regular basis  including at the end of each fiscal year  for indications of impairment 
impairment is indicated whenever the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable or exceeds estimated fair value 
for purposes of calculating impairment on long lived operating assets  the company has defined its reporting units to be each of the company s plant locations 
the company estimates fair value of its long lived assets at each plant based upon future undiscounted net cash flows from use of those assets 
in calculating such estimates  actual historical operating results and anticipated future economic factors  such as future business volume  future finished product prices  and future operating costs and expense are evaluated and estimated as a component of the calculation of future undiscounted cash flows for each operating plant location 
the estimates of fair value of the reporting units and of future undiscounted net cash flows from operation of these assets could change if actual volumes  prices  costs or expenses vary from these estimates 
a future reduction of earnings in the company s plants could result in an impairment charge because the estimate of fair value would be negatively impacted by a reduction of earnings 
the company reviews the carrying value of assets held for sale on a regular basis for indications of impairment 
impairment is indicated whenever the carrying value of the asset exceeds estimated fair value 
for purposes of calculating impairment on assets held for sale  the company utilizes estimated sales value of the assets as an estimate of fair value 
the estimates of fair value of the assets held for sale could change if the actual sales value realized  or realizable  varies from the estimated sale value 
the net book value of property  plant and equipment was approximately million and million at january  and january   respectively 
the net book value of intangible assets was approximately million and million at january  and january   respectively 
page goodwill valuation the company reviews the carrying value of goodwill on a regular basis  including at the end of each fiscal year  for indications of impairment at each plant location which has recorded goodwill as an asset 
impairment is indicated whenever the carrying value of plant assets exceeds the estimated fair value of plant assets 
for purposes of evaluating impairment of goodwill  the company estimates fair value of plant assets at each plant  based upon future discounted net cash flows from use of those assets 
in calculating such estimates  actual historical operating results and anticipated future economic factors  such as future business volume  future finished product prices  and future operating costs and expenses are evaluated and estimated as a component of the calculation of future discounted cash flows for each operating plant location with recorded goodwill 
the estimates of fair value of assets at these plant locations and of future discounted net cash flows from operation of these assets could change if actual volumes  prices  costs or expenses vary from these estimates 
a future reduction of earnings in the plants with recorded goodwill could result in an impairment charge because the estimate of fair value would be negatively impacted by a reduction of earnings at those plants 
goodwill was approximately million at both january  and january  accrued medical claims liability the company provides a self insured group health plan to its employees  which provides medical benefits to participating employees 
the company has an employer s stop loss insurance policy to cover individual claims in excess of  per employee per year 
the amount charged to medical insurance expense includes claims paid during the year and includes estimates of liabilities for outstanding medical claims under the plan at the balance sheet date  based upon historical claims expense and historical claims submission information  and also includes an accrual for estimated severe illness claims  which is based upon the stop loss limit per employee and the number of employees filing those claims 
if actual future medical claims by employees varies significantly from historical spending or if the actual timeliness of submission of those claims by medical care providers changes  the actual medical claims may vary from the estimated liability 
the actual cost of providing medical care to severely ill employees and dependents may vary from estimates if the patient either recovers or dies 
accrued medical claims liability included in accrued expenses was approximately million and million at january  and january   respectively 
self insurance  environmental  and legal reserves the company purchases its workers compensation  auto and general liability insurance on a retrospective basis 
the company estimates and accrues its expected ultimate costs related to claims occurring during each fiscal year and carries this accrual as a reserve until such claims are paid by the company 
estimates of self insurance liability are based upon the report of a third party actuarial report  which the company relies upon in calculating its estimates 
the company has also accrued loss reserves related to environmental and litigation matters  based upon estimated undiscounted future costs 
in developing estimates of loss  the company utilizes its staff  outside consultants  and outside counsel as sources of information and judgment as to the expected undiscounted future costs of the claims 
with respect to the company s self insurance  environmental and litigation reserves  estimates of reserve liability could change if future events are different than those included in the estimates of the actuary  consultants or management of the company 
the reserve for insurance  environmental  and litigation contingencies included in accrued expenses and other non current liabilities were approximately million and million at january  and january   respectively 
pension liability the company provides retirement benefits to employees under separate final pay noncontributory pension plans for salaried and hourly employees excluding those employees covered by a union sponsored plan  who meet service and age requirements 
benefits are based principally on length of service and earnings patterns during the five years preceding retirement 
pension expense and pension liability recorded by the company is based upon an annual actuarial estimate provided by a third party administrator 
factors included in estimates of current year pension expense and pension liability at the balance sheet date include estimated future service period of employees  estimated future pay of employees  estimated future retirement ages of employees  and the projected time period of pension benefit payments 
two of the most significant assumptions used to calculate future pension obligations are the discount rate applied to pension liability and the expected rate of return on pension plan assets 
these assumptions and estimates are subject to the risk of change over time  and each factor has inherent uncertainties which neither the actuary nor the company is able to control  or to predict with certainty 
page the discount rate applied to the company s pension liability is the interest rate used to calculate the present value of the pension benefit obligation 
the discount rate is based on the yield of long term corporate fixed income securities at the measurement date of october in the year of calculation 
the weighted average discount rate was and at october in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the expected rate of return on the company s pension plan assets is the interest rate used to calculate future returns on investment of the plan assets 
the expected return on plan assets is a long term assumption whose accuracy can only be assessed over a long period of time 
the weighted average expected return on pension plan assets was for both fiscal and fiscal the company has recorded a minimum pension liability of approximately million and million at january  and january   respectively 
the company s net pension cost was approximately million  million  and million for the fiscal years ending january   january   and december   respectively 
income taxes in calculating net income  the company includes estimates in the calculation of tax expense  the resulting tax liability  and in future utilization of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary timing differences between financial statement presentation and tax recognition of revenue and expense 
the company s deferred tax assets include net operating loss carry forward  which is limited to approximately million per year in future utilization due to the change in majority control  resulting from the may recapitalization of the company 
as a result of these matters  the estimate of future utilization of deferred tax assets relies upon the forecast of future reversal of the company s deferred tax liabilities  which provide some evidence of the ability of the company to utilize deferred tax assets in future years 
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets are recorded when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will expire before they are utilized and the tax benefit is realized 
based upon the company s evaluation of these matters  a significant portion of the company s net operating loss carry forwards will expire unused 
the valuation allowance established to provide a reserve against these deferred tax assets was approximately million and million at january  and january   respectively 
stock option expense the company currently discloses the pro forma effects on net income of expense of stock options issued  and the company will begin recording compensation expense related to stock options granted  beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  upon adoption of recently issued sfas r 
the calculation of expense of stock options issued utilizes the black scholes mathematical model which estimates the fair value of the option award to the holder and the compensation expense to the company  based upon estimates of volatility  risk free rates of return at the date of issue  and projected vesting of the option grants 
if actual share price volatility or vesting differs from the projection  the actual expense recorded may vary 
the company s pro forma expense related to stock options granted was approximately million  million  and million in fiscal years ending january   january   and december  page new accounting pronouncements the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  on the first day of the third quarter of fiscal the adoption of sfas affected accounting for the company s  shares of preferred stock  which was issued in may   had a carrying amount of million including accumulated preferred stock dividends payable of million at january   and was redeemed in connection with the company s recapitalization in may  discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  and elsewhere  herein 
the company s preferred stock contained a mandatory redemption feature which would have required redemption of the preferred stock on may   at face value of the preferred stock of million  plus accumulated preferred stock dividends payable 
sfas requires that mandatorily redeemable financial instruments  such as the company s preferred stock  be reported as a liability rather than as a component of stockholders equity 
sfas also requires that preferred stock dividends and accretion related to the preferred stock outstanding shall be included in interest expense  beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  on a prospective basis 
preferred stock dividends and accretion included in interest expense in fiscal were approximately million 
preferred stock dividends and accretion included in interest expense in fiscal were approximately million 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company redeemed the preferred stock outstanding at face value of million and accumulated preferred dividends of approximately million 
in november   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for inventory costs  which amends accounting research bulletin no 
 related to inventory pricing 
sfas will require that abnormal freight  handling costs  and amounts of wasted materials be treated as current period costs  and will no longer permit these costs to be capitalized as inventory costs on the balance sheet 
sfas will be effective for inventory costs incurred during annual periods beginning after june  the first day of fiscal 
adoption of sfas is not expected to result in a material impact to the company s financial statements 
in december   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
r sfas r  shared based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and no 
sfas r will require that companies recognize in the income statement the fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees as of the grant date 
sfas r will be effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june  the first day of the third quarter of fiscal 
adoption of sfas r is expected to result in additional compensation expense to the company  net of applicable taxes  of approximately million in fiscal  approximately million in fiscal  and less than million each year in fiscal and fiscal future estimates of option based compensation expense are based upon outstanding options currently held by employees and directors  expected vesting periods  and upon the historic option pricing model used by the company for valuation of options based compensation expense  and does not take into account the impact of subsequent issuance of options after january  which may occur 
in december   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas related to exchanges of non monetary assets an amendment to apb opinion no 
 which removes the exceptions for recording exchanges at other than fair value for the exchange of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception only for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a non monetary exchange is deemed to have commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the provisions of this statement are effective for non monetary exchanges occurring in the fiscal periods beginning after june  adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact to the company s financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s market risks affecting the company are exposures to changes in prices of the finished products the company sells  interest rates on debt  availability of raw material supply  and the price of natural gas used in the company s plants 
raw materials available to the company are impacted by seasonal factors  including holidays  when raw material volume declines  warm weather  which can adversely affect the quality of raw material processed and finished products produced  and cold weather  which can impact the collection of raw material 
predominantly all of the company s finished products are commodities which are generally sold at prices prevailing at the time of sale 
the company has used interest rate and natural gas swaps to manage these related risks 
the company is not currently party to any interest rate swap agreements 
the company uses natural gas forward purchase agreements with its suppliers to manage the price risk of natural gas used in its facilities 
as of january   the company was party to fixed for float swap agreements for the purchase of natural gas 
at january   the fair value of the company s positions in these swap agreements was a liability of approximately million 
the company s positions in these swap agreements were settled during january and february as of january   the company had forward purchase agreements in place for purchases of approximately million of natural gas for the months of january through april as of january   the company had forward purchase agreements in place for purchases of approximately million of finished product in the month of january page interest rate sensitivity the company s obligations subject to fixed or variable interest rates include in thousands  except interest rates total less than year years years more than years long term debt fixed rate   average interest rate variable rate     average interest rate total  the company s fixed rate debt obligations consist of the senior subordinated notes and various other notes payable that accrue interest at an annual weighted average fixed rate of approximately 
this obligation is not affected by changes in interest rates 
the company has million in variable rate debt that represents the balance outstanding under the new senior credit agreement executed on april  this portion of the company s debt is sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company estimates that a increase in interest rates will increase the company s interest expense by approximately million in fiscal risk factors any investment in the company will be subject to risks inherent to the company s business 
before making an investment decision in the company  you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in or incorporated by reference into this report 
if any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occurs  the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if any of these events occurs  the trading price of the company s securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
the company s results of operations and cash flow may be reduced by decreases in the market price of its products 
the company s finished products are commodities  the prices of which are quoted on established commodity markets 
accordingly  the company s results of operations will be affected by fluctuations in the prevailing market prices of such finished products 
a significant decrease in the market price of the company s products would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and cash flow 
the most competitive aspect of the company s business is the procurement of raw materials 
the company s management believes that the most competitive aspect of the company s business is the procurement of raw materials rather than the sale of finished products 
during the last ten plus years  pronounced consolidation within the meat packing industry has resulted in bigger and more efficient slaughtering operations  the majority of which utilize captive processors 
simultaneously  the number of small meat packers  which have historically been a dependable source of supply for non captive processors  such as the company  has decreased significantly 
although the total amount of slaughtering may be flat or only moderately increasing  the availability  quantity and quality of raw materials available to the independent processors from these sources have all decreased 
major competitors include baker commodities in the west  national by products in the midwest  and griffin industries in texas and the southeast 
each of these businesses compete in both the rendering and restaurant service segments 
a significant decrease in raw materials available could materially and adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
page the rendering and restaurant services industry is highly fragmented and very competitive 
the company competes with other rendering and restaurant services businesses and alternative methods of disposal of animal processing by products and used restaurant cooking oil provided by trash haulers and waste management companies  as well as the alternative of illegal disposal 
the company charges a collection fee to offset a portion of the cost incurred in collecting raw material 
in recent years the company has become highly dependent upon these collection fees 
to the extent suppliers of raw materials look to alternate methods of disposal  whether as a result of the company s collection fees being deemed too expensive or otherwise  the company s raw material supply will decrease and the company s collection fee revenues will decrease  which could materially and adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
the company may incur material costs and liabilities in complying with government regulations 
the company is subject to the rules and regulations of various federal  state and local governmental agencies 
material rules and regulations and the applicable agencies are the fda  which regulates food and feed safety  the usda  including its agencies aphis and fsis  which regulates collection and production methods  the epa  which regulates air and water discharge requirements  as well as local and state agencies governing air and water discharge  state departments of agriculture  which regulate animal by product collection and transportation procedures and animal feed quality  the usdot  as well as local and state agencies  which regulate the operation of the company s commercial vehicles  and the sec  which regulates securities and information required in annual and quarterly reports filed by publicly traded companies 
such rules and regulations may influence the company s operating results at one or more facilities 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur material costs and liabilities in connection with such regulations 
the company is highly dependent on natural gas 
the company s operations are highly dependent on the use of natural gas 
a material increase in natural gas prices over a sustained period of time could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item  management s discussion and analysis  for a recent history of natural gas pricing 
the company s business may be affected by fda regulations relating to bse 
effective august   the fda promulgated a rule prohibiting the use of mammalian proteins  with some exceptions  in feeds for cattle  sheep and other ruminant animals 
the intent of this rule is to prevent the spread of bse  commonly referred to as mad cow disease 
the company s management believes that the company is in compliance with the provisions of the rule 
a case of bse was diagnosed in a cow in the state of washington on december  within days of the media reports of the case of bse  many countries moved to ban imports of us produced beef and beef products  including meat and bone meal and initially tallow  though this initial ban on tallow was relaxed to permit imports of us produced tallow with less than impurities 
the us government issued regulations in response to the case of bse which include page on december   the secretary of agriculture announced new beef slaughter meat processing regulations to assure of the safety of the meat supply 
the regulations prohibit non ambulatory animals from entering the food chain  require removal of srm at slaughter  and prohibit carcasses from cattle tested for bse from entering the food chain until the animals are shown negative for bse 
on january   the fda announced intentions to modify its feed rule cfr by removing the exemptions for certain products  including blood and blood products  and requiring dedicated processing lines for handling and processing restricted use and exempted proteins 
on july   the fda requested public comment on their intended modifications to the feed rule as well as regulations that would prohibit material derived from srm and dead or non ambulatory cattle in animal feed  prohibit all animal proteins in feed for ruminant animals  and or require that only bft either derived from srm free material or containing less than impurities be allowed in animal feed 
only questions were posed in this announcement of proposed rulemaking  to which the company  among others  responded in comments submitted to the fda 
no new regulations affecting animal feed or modifying the feed rule have been issued to date 
this situation will likely continue to be fluid into fiscal on january   the fda announced its intent to ban the use of certain animal tissue derived materials in food and supplements 
subsequently  on july   the fda published regulations prohibiting srm from human food and cosmetics  and srm and non ambulatory or dead cattle from cosmetics 
bft that is either derived from srm free raw materials or contains less than hexane insoluble impurities will be permitted in human food  supplements and cosmetics 
derivatives of bft glycerin and fatty acids are exempt from these regulations 
on september   the fda issued guidance document  which cited the agency s statutory authority to consider animal feed and feed ingredients derived from a bse positive animal to be adulterated and prohibit the use of adulterated material in animal feed 
the occurrence of bse in the united states may result in additional us government regulations  finished product export restrictions by foreign governments  market price fluctuations for the company s finished products  reduced demand for beef and beef products by consumers  or increase the company s operating costs 
the impact of the occurrence of the case of bse is not fully known at this time  but may positively or negatively impact the company s results of operations in the future 
certain of the company s operating facilities are highly dependent upon a few suppliers 
certain of the company s rendering facilities are highly dependent on one or a few suppliers 
should any of these suppliers choose alternate methods of disposal  cease their operations  have their operations interrupted by casualty  or otherwise cease using the company s collection services  such operating facilities may be materially and adversely affected 
the company s success is dependent on the company s key personnel 
the company s success depends to a significant extent upon a number of key employees  including members of senior management 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and prospects 
the company believes that its future success will depend in part on its ability to attract  motivate and retain skilled technical  managerial  marketing and sales personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting  motivating and retaining key personnel 
the failure to hire and retain such personnel could materially adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
in certain markets the company is highly dependent upon the continued and uninterrupted operation of a single operating facility 
in the majority of the company s markets  in the event of a casualty or condemnation involving a facility located in such market  the company would utilize a nearby operating facility to continue to serve its customers in such market 
in certain markets  however  the company does not have alternate operating facilities 
in the event of a casualty or condemnation  or an unscheduled shutdown  the company may experience an interruption in its ability to service its customers and to procure raw materials 
this may materially and adversely affect the company s business and results of operations in such markets 
in addition  after an operating facility affected by a casualty or condemnation is restored  there could be no assurance that customers who in the interim choose to use alternative disposal services would return to use the company s services 
page restrictions imposed by the company s credit agreements and future debt agreements may limit its ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in the company s interest 
the company s credit agreements currently  and future debt agreements may  restrict its ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends and make other distributions  amend the terms of subordinated debt  make restricted payments  create liens  merge  consolidate or acquire other businesses  sell and otherwise dispose of assets  enter into transactions with affiliates  make investments  loans  and advances  guarantee indebtedness or other obligations  enter into operating leases or sale leaseback  synthetic leases  or similar transactions  enter into hedge agreements  make changes to its corporate name  fiscal year  capital structure and constituent documents  and engage in new lines of business unrelated to the company s current businesses 
these terms may impose restrictions on the company s ability to finance future operations  implement its business strategy  fund its capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in its interest 
in addition  the company s credit agreements require  and future indebtedness may require  the company to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios 
although the company is currently in compliance with the financial ratios and does not plan on engaging in transactions that may cause the company to not be in compliance with the ratios  its ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond its control  including the risks described in the other risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
a breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the company s inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under the credit agreements 
in the event of a default under the credit agreements  the lenders under the credit agreements may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding  together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees  to be immediately due and payable 
the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further financing  including under the revolving credit facility 
if the company is unable to repay these borrowings when due  the lenders under the credit agreements also will have the right to proceed against the collateral  which consists of substantially all of the company s assets  including real property and cash 
if the indebtedness under the credit agreements were to be accelerated  the company s assets may be insufficient to repay this indebtedness in full under those circumstances 
any future credit agreements or other agreement relating to the company s indebtedness to which the company may become a party may include the covenants described above and other restrictive covenants 
the company has a history of net losses and the company may incur net losses in the future which could adversely affect the company s ability to service its indebtedness 
the company has a recent history of net losses but has been profitable in each of the past three years 
for the years ended december  and december   the company s net losses were approximately million and million  respectively 
following the recapitalization of the company completed in may  the company reported a net profit for the years ended january   january   and december   of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
if  however  the company incurs net losses in the future  its ability to pay principal and interest on its indebtedness could be adversely affected 
page in order to establish consistent profitability  the company must achieve the following maintain adequate levels of raw material volumes  maintain its collection fees at levels sufficient to recover an adequate portion of collection costs  increase gross margins to the extent of cost increases  maintain its distribution capability  maintain competitiveness in pricing  continue to manage its operating expenses 
there can be no assurance that the company will achieve these objectives or attain consistent profitability 
the company s ability to pay any dividends on its common stock may be limited 
the company has not declared or paid cash dividends on its common stock since january  the payment of any dividends by the company on its common stock in the future will be at the discretion of the company s board of directors and will depend upon  among other things  future earnings  operations  capital requirements  the company s general financial condition  the general financial condition of the company s subsidiaries and general business conditions 
the company s ability to pay any cash or noncash dividends on its common stock is subject to applicable provisions of state law and to the terms of its credit agreements 
the company s credit agreements permit the company to pay cash dividends on the company s common stock pursuant with the terms and conditions of the company s credit agreements 
moreover  under delaware law  the company is permitted to pay cash or accumulated dividends on the company s capital stock  including the company s common stock  only out of surplus  or if there is no surplus  out of the company s net profits for the fiscal year in which a dividend is declared or for the immediately preceding fiscal year 
surplus is defined as the excess of a company s total assets over the sum of its total liabilities plus the par value of its outstanding capital stock 
in order to pay dividends  the company must have surplus or net profits equal to the full amount of the dividends at the time such dividend is declared 
in determining the company s ability to pay dividends  delaware law permits the company s board of directors to revalue the company s assets and liabilities from time to time to their fair market values in order to establish the amount of surplus
