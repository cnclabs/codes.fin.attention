more information about potential factors that could affect our business and financial results is included in the section entitled risk factors 
overview we are a leading animal healthcare services company and operate the largest networks of veterinary diagnostic laboratories and freestanding  full service animal hospitals in the united states 
we also sell ultrasound and digital radiography imaging equipment  related computer hardware  software and ancillary services to the veterinary market 
our network of veterinary diagnostic laboratories provides sophisticated testing and consulting services used by veterinarians in the detection  diagnosis  evaluation  monitoring  treatment and prevention of diseases and other conditions affecting animals 
our animal hospitals offer a full range of general medical and surgical services for companion animals 
we treat diseases and injuries  offer pharmaceutical products and perform a variety of pet wellness programs  including health examinations  diagnostic testing  routine vaccinations  spaying  neutering and dental care 
at december   our laboratory network consisted of laboratories serving all states and our animal hospital network consisted of animal hospitals in states 
significant acquisitions sound technologies  inc on october   we acquired sti  which is a supplier of ultrasound and digital radiography equipment and related computer hardware  software and services to the veterinary industry 
as of december   we had not finalized the purchase price accounting for this transaction as we are still in the process of integrating sti into our operations 
as part of integrating sti into our operations  we may incur additional legal and accounting fees and employee severance costs 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  we are obligated to pay an additional million if certain performance targets are achieved 
costs incurred in integrating sti and the payment of the million obligation will result in additions to the total purchase price of the transaction 
the total consideration  excluding the potential integration costs and the million obligation described above  as of december  was million  consisting of million in cash paid to holders of sti stock  million in assumed debt  million in assumed liabilities  and  paid for professional and other outside services 
national petcare centers  inc on june   we acquired npc  which operated animal hospitals located in states as of the merger date 
this merger allowed us to expand our animal hospital operations in nine states  particularly california and texas  and to expand into two new states  oregon and oklahoma 
we have finalized the purchase price accounting for this transaction except for our plan to close or sell certain npc animal hospitals that do not meet our operating model 
the costs to close or sell these animal hospitals  which 
table of contents will consist primarily of lease termination costs and employee severance  will result in additions to the purchase price 
the total consideration  excluding the cost to close or sell certain npc animal hospitals as described above  as of december  was million  consisting of million in cash paid to holders of npc stock and debt  million in assumed debt  million in assumed liabilities  million of operating leases whose terms were in excess of market  million paid for professional and other outside services  and million paid as part of our plan to close certain facilities and terminate certain employees 
in addition  we incurred costs of approximately million primarily to operate npc s corporate office  which was closed in september these costs were expensed as incurred and are included in corporate selling  general and administrative expense 
growth in facilities the following table summarizes our growth in facilities for laboratories and animal hospitals for the years ended december    and laboratories beginning of period acquisitions and new facilities new facilities relocated into other labs operated by us end of period animal hospitals beginning of period acquisitions new facilities relocated into hospitals operated by us sold or closed end of period our medical technology business operates out of a main office with field sales and support personnel throughout the country 
common stock activity in february  we completed an offering of our common stock 
as a result of this offering we issued  shares of common stock and received net proceeds of million 
we applied the net proceeds from this offering primarily to repay the entire remaining principal amount of our senior notes 
on august   we effected a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend payable to stockholders of record as of august  all share and per share information included in this document have been restated to reflect the effect of the stock dividend 
significant accounting policies we believe that the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of all our accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see footnote  summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 

table of contents revenue laboratory and animal hospital revenue we recognize laboratory and animal hospital revenue only after the following criteria are met there exists adequate evidence of the transaction  delivery of goods has occurred or services have been rendered  and the price is not contingent on future activity and collectibility is reasonably assured 
approximately of laboratory revenue for the year ended december  was intercompany revenue that was generated by providing laboratory services to our animal hospitals 
for purposes of reviewing the operating performance of the business segments  all intercompany revenue is accounted for as if the transaction was with an independent third party at current market prices 
for financial reporting purposes  intercompany revenue is eliminated as part of our consolidation 
we give discounts  such as those for prompt payment  to clients in periods subsequent to the period the related revenue was recognized  however  we report the related revenue net of those discounts 
in order to net the discounts against the related revenue  we estimate the discounts based on historical experience 
we do not expect that revisions to these discounts would have a material effect on our condensed  consolidated financial statements 
medical technology revenue substantially all of our revenue is derived from the sale of ultrasound imaging equipment and digital radiography equipment  however  we also derive additional revenue from i licensing our software  ii providing technical support and product updates related to the equipment we sell and our software  otherwise known as maintenance  and iii providing professional services related to the equipment we sell and our software  including installations  on site training and education services 
we frequently sell equipment and license our software in multiple element arrangements in which the customer may choose a combination of one or more of the following elements i ultrasound imaging equipment  ii digital radiography equipment  iii software products  iv computer hardware  v maintenance  and vi professional services 
while the accounting for the sale of equipment is substantially governed by the requirements of staff accounting bulletin  sab  no 
 revenue recognition  as amended  and the sale of software licenses and related items is governed by statement of position  sop  no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended  we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software license  maintenance and professional service revenue to be recognized in each accounting period 
we sell our ultrasound imaging equipment with and without related computer hardware and software 
we account for the sale of ultrasound imaging equipment on a stand alone basis under requirements of sab no 
we account for the sale of ultrasound imaging equipment with related computer hardware and software by bifurcating the transaction and accounting for the ultrasound imaging equipment under sab no 
and the computer hardware and software under sop no 
the consensus reached by emerging issues task force  eitf  no 
 applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software  requires that arrangements that include software that is more than incidental to the products or services as a whole are to be accounted for under sop we have concluded that our software is incidental to the ultrasound imaging equipment because that equipment is manufactured as an out of the box solution and many of our customers purchase it as such 
we have also concluded that the software is more than incidental to the computer hardware we sell and therefore account for that portion of the sale under sop we sell our digital radiography equipment with related computer hardware and software 
the digital radiography equipment requires the computer hardware and software to function 
as a result  we account for the digital radiography sales under sop 
table of contents under the residual method prescribed by sop  revenue is recognized when vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement ie maintenance and professional services  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement ie the equipment  computer hardware or the software product 
each transaction requires careful analysis to ensure that all of the individual elements in the license transaction have been identified  along with the fair value of each element 
we allocate revenue to each undelivered element based on its fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
we are recognizing the revenue on the computer hardware and software we sell with our ultrasound and digital radiography equipment over the period we are providing maintenance  ranging from one to four years 
we are recognizing the revenue for the sale of the digital radiography equipment over that same period because the software and computer hardware we sell with this equipment is essential to its functionality 
we recognize the revenue on the sale of ultrasound imaging equipment upon delivery 
in determining whether or not to recognize revenue  we evaluate each of these criteria evidence of an arrangement we consider a non cancelable agreement signed by us and the customer to be evidence of an arrangement 
delivery we consider delivery to have occurred when the ultrasound imaging equipment is delivered and the digital radiography equipment is installed 
we recognize revenue for professional services when that service is provided or on a straight line basis over the service contract term  based on the nature of the service or the terms of the contract 
fixed or determinable fee we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenue if all other revenue recognition requirements are met 
we generally consider payments that are due within six months to be fixed or determinable based upon our successful collection history 
we only consider fees to be fixed or determinable if they are not subject to refund or adjustment 
collection is deemed probable we conduct a credit review for all significant transactions at the time of the arrangement to determine the credit worthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we defer the revenue and recognize the revenue upon cash collection 
our software is ready to use by the customer upon receipt  and there is no significant customization of the underlying software code required to meet the individual needs of customers 
we provide warranties for our software guaranteeing its performance for a defined period of time 
historically  the costs to satisfy these warranties have been nominal and we expect this to be the case in the future 
accordingly  we expense these costs as incurred 
administrative and support revenue certain states prohibit business corporations from providing  or holding themselves out as providers of  veterinary medical care 
in these states  we provide administrative and support services to veterinary medical groups pursuant to management agreements 
the veterinary medical groups are each solely responsible for all aspects of the practice of veterinary medicine 
in return for our services  the veterinary medical groups pay us management fees 
we consolidate the financial results of these veterinary medical groups 
valuation of goodwill our goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the total amount of our goodwill at december  was million  consisting of million for our laboratory segment  million for our animal hospital segment and million for our medical technology segment 

table of contents annually  and upon material changes in our operating environment  we test our goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair market value of our reporting units  which equate to our laboratory  animal hospital and medical technology operating segments  to their respective net book value 
at december  and  the estimated fair market value of each of our operating segments exceeded their respective net book value  resulting in a conclusion that our goodwill was fairly stated 
an independent valuation expert estimated the fair market value based on standard valuation techniques 
income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we record deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets  which represent taxes to be recovered or settled in the future 
we adjust our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities to reflect changes in tax rates or other statutory tax provisions 
changes in tax rates or other statutory provisions are recognized in the period the change occurs 
we make judgments in assessing our ability to realize future benefits from our deferred tax assets 
as such  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets for the portion we believe will not be realized 
at december  and  we used valuation allowances to offset net operating loss carryforwards and investment related expenditures where the realization of this deduction is uncertain 
we have also recorded as other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets a liability for any differences between the probable tax bases and the as filed tax bases of certain assets and liabilities 
such liability relates to losses that to our best judgment are probable 
changes in facts and circumstances may cause us to lower our estimates or determine that payments are no longer probable resulting in a reduction of our future tax provision  or increase our estimates resulting in an increase in our future tax provision 
in addition  there are certain tax contingencies that represent a possible future payment but not a probable one 
while we have not recognized a liability for these possible future payments  they may result in future cash payments and increase our tax provision

table of contents revenue the following table summarizes our revenue in thousands  except percentages change laboratory animal hospital medical technology other intercompany total revenue laboratory revenue laboratory revenue increased million in as compared to  which increased million as compared to the components of the increase in laboratory revenue are detailed below in thousands  except percentages and average price per requisition comparative analysis comparative analysis laboratory revenue change change internal growth number of requisitions average revenue per requisition total internal revenue billing day adjustment acquired revenue total computed by dividing total internal revenue by the number of requisitions 
internal revenue and requisitions were calculated using laboratory operating results  adjusted to exclude operating results for the newly acquired laboratories that we did not own for the comparable prior year period and adjusted for the impact resulting from any differences in the number of billing days in comparable periods 
there was one additional billing day in as compared to the increases in requisitions from internal growth in and are the result of a continued trend in veterinary medicine to focus on the importance of laboratory diagnostic testing in the diagnosis  early detection and treatment of diseases 
this trend is driven by an increase in the number of specialists in the veterinary industry relying on diagnostic testing  the increased focus on diagnostic testing in veterinary schools and general increased awareness through ongoing marketing and continuing education programs provided by ourselves  pharmaceutical companies and other service providers in the industry 
in addition  we continue to see the impact from the recent migration of diagnostic testing from the human healthcare industry and the advent of medicine in the veterinary industry that requires diagnostic assessment and monitoring 
the increases in the average revenue per requisition in and are attributable to price increases and changes in the mix of tests performed per requisition 
the prices of most tests were increased to in february and to in february 
table of contents as the result of our laboratory acquisitions subsequent to january   we generated an additional million of revenue referred to in the above table as acquired revenue in as compared to as the result of our laboratory acquisitions subsequent to january   we generated an additional million of revenue referred to in the above table as acquired revenue in as compared to animal hospital revenue animal hospital revenue increased million in as compared to  which increased million as compared to the components of the increases are summarized in the following table in thousands  except percentages and average price per order comparative analysis comparative analysis animal hospital revenue change change same store facility orders average revenue per order same store revenue business day adjustment net acquired revenue total computed by dividing same store revenue by same store orders 
same store revenue and orders were calculated using animal hospital operating results  adjusted to exclude the operating results for the newly acquired animal hospitals that we did not own for the entire period presented and adjusted for the impact resulting from any differences in the number of business days in comparable periods 
the business day adjustment reflects the impact of two additional business days in as compared to over the last few years  certain pet related products  including medication prescriptions  traditionally sold at animal hospitals have become more widely available in retail stores and other distribution channels  and  as a result  we have fewer customers coming to our animal hospitals solely to purchase those items 
in addition  there has been a decline in the number of vaccinations as some recent professional literature and research has suggested that vaccinations can be given to pets less frequently 
orders for these pet related products and vaccinations generally generate revenue that is less than the average revenue for other orders 
in addition  our business strategy has placed greater emphasis on high quality veterinary care and wellness programs  which typically generate higher priced orders 
these trends have resulted in a decrease in the number of orders and an increase in the average revenue per order 
price increases also contributed to the increase in the average revenue per order  which approximated to on services at most hospitals in both february and prices are reviewed on an annual basis for each hospital and adjustments are made based on market considerations  demographics and our costs 
net acquired revenue represents the revenue from those animal hospitals acquired  net of revenue from those animal hospitals sold or closed  on or after the beginning of the comparative period  which was january  for the comparative analysis and january  for the comparative analysis 
fluctuations in net acquired revenue occur due to the volume  size  and timing of acquisitions and disposals during the periods compared 

table of contents medical technology revenue the components of revenue for our medical technology segment for the quarter ended december  are summarized in the following table in thousands medical technology revenue ultrasound imaging equipment digital radiography equipment education and installation services consulting and mobile imaging services total revenue we acquired our medical technology business on october  and consequently do not have comparative operating results for prior periods 
at december   we had not fully integrated our medical technology division into our operations 
as we complete the integration of this business we may make changes to its operations and the terms on which we distribute the equipment  software and services that we offer

laboratory direct costs are comprised of all costs of laboratory services  including but not limited to  salaries of veterinarians  specialists  technicians and other laboratory based personnel  facilities rent  occupancy costs  depreciation and amortization  and supply costs 
the increase in laboratory gross profit margin in and was primarily attributable to increases in laboratory revenue combined with operating leverage associated with our laboratory business 
our operating leverage comes from the incremental margins we realize on additional tests ordered by the same client  as well as when more comprehensive tests are ordered 
we are able to benefit from these incremental margins due to the relative fixed cost nature of our laboratory business 

table of contents animal hospital gross profit animal hospital gross profit is calculated as animal hospital revenue less animal hospital direct costs 
animal hospital direct costs are comprised of all costs of services and products at the animal hospitals  including  but not limited to  salaries of veterinarians  technicians and all other animal hospital based personnel  facilities rent  occupancy costs  supply costs  depreciation and amortization  certain marketing and promotional expense and costs of goods sold associated with the retail sales of pet food and pet supplies 
since january   we have had significant growth in our animal hospital division as a result of the acquisition of hospitals  of which were acquired in the npc merger on june  our animal hospital gross profit margin decreased slightly in as compared to primarily as a result of the impact of the relatively large number of hospitals we recently acquired 
as expected  the hospitals we recently acquired  as a group  had a gross profit margin lower than those animal hospitals that we have operated for a period of time sufficient to allow us to fully achieve operating efficiencies 
medical technology gross profit medical technology gross profit is calculated as medical technology revenue less medical technology direct costs 
medical technology direct costs are comprised of all products and services costs  including  but not limited to  all costs of equipment  related products and services  salaries of technicians  support personnel  trainers  diagnostic specialists and other non administrative personnel  facilites rent  occupancy costs  depreciation and amortization and supply costs

table of contents inflation historically  our operations have not been materially affected by inflation 
we cannot assure that our operations will not be affected by inflation in the future 
related party transactions transactions with zoasis corporation we incurred marketing expense for vaccine reminders and other direct mail services provided by zoasis  an internet based business that is majority owned by robert antin  our chief executive officer and chairman 
art antin  our chief operating officer  owns a interest in zoasis and a separate officer sold his entire interest in zoasis prior to december  for less than  the expense incurred was   and  for  and  respectively 
the pricing of these services is comparable to prices paid by us to independent third parties for similar services 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes our cash flows in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased million in primarily due to improved operating performance and acquisitions 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in taxes paid of million and a use of working capital of million 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million in primarily due to improved operating performance  acquisitions  a decrease in interest paid of million  and the termination of a management services agreement with leonard green partners  lp in  which  including payments for management services received  approximated million paid in the factors causing an increase in were partially offset by an increase in taxes paid of million and a use of working capital of million 
on a prospective basis  we anticipate cash flow from operating activities to continue growing in line with increases in operating income resulting from improved operating performance and acquisitions 
however  we also anticipate that operating cash flow may be negatively impacted by an increase in cash paid for interest as a result of interest rates rising 
interest rates have been at historical lows and are projected to increase over the next several years 
significant increases in interest rates may materially impact our operating cash flows because of the variable rate nature of our senior credit facility 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of cash used for the acquisition of animal hospitals  including the npc merger  and laboratories and expenditures for property  plant and equipment 
in addition  we acquired sti on october  the npc merger and sti are discussed above in the significant acquisitions section 

table of contents depending upon the attractiveness of the candidates and the strategic fit with our existing operations  we intend to acquire approximately to independent animal hospitals per year with aggregate annual revenues of approximately million to million 
in addition  we also evaluate the acquisition of animal hospital chains  laboratories or related businesses if favorable opportunities are presented 
for example  in we acquired animal hospitals  of which were part of a chain operated by npc  which we acquired in june of we intend to primarily use cash in our acquisitions but  depending on the timing and amount of our acquisitions  we may use stock or debt 
in  we also intend to spend approximately million for property and equipment 
financing activities in december  we amended and restated our senior credit facility to replace the existing senior term e notes in the principal amount of million with an interest rate margin of with new senior term f notes in the same principal amount with an interest rate margin of 
in connection with this transaction  we paid certain financing costs 
in june  we amended and restated our senior credit facility to replace the existing senior term d notes in the principal amount of million with an interest rate margin of with new senior term e notes in the principal amount of million with an interest rate margin of 
the additional borrowings were used to fund the npc merger  which we discuss above in the significant acquisitions section 
in connection with this transaction  we paid certain financing costs 
in august  we refinanced our senior credit facility to replace the existing senior term c notes in the principal amount of million with an interest rate margin of with million of cash on hand and new senior term d notes in the principal amount of million with an interest rate margin of 
in connection with this transaction  we paid certain financing costs 
in february  we sold million shares of our common stock 
approximately million of the million in net proceeds received were used to redeem the entire principal amount of our senior notes due at a redemption price of of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
in connection with this transaction  we paid certain financing costs 
in october  we redeemed million  the entire principal amount  of our senior subordinated notes due at a redemption price of and million in principal amount of our senior notes due at a redemption price of with cash on hand and million in additional borrowings under our senior term c notes 
in connection with this transaction  we paid certain financing costs 
in august  we refinanced our senior credit facility to replace the existing senior term a and senior term b notes in the principal amount of million with a weighted average interest rate margin of with new senior term c notes in the same principal amount with an interest rate margin of 
in connection with this transaction  we paid certain financing costs 
borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility are the result of normal working capital shifts created by the seasonality of our business and the timing of acquisition activity 
at the end of we borrowed million  and in early we repaid the full amount 
at december   we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

table of contents future contractual cash requirements the following table sets forth the scheduled principal  interest and other contractual cash obligations due by us for each of the years indicated in thousands total thereafter long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases fixed cash interest expense variable cash interest expense swap agreements purchase obligations other long term liabilities pursuant to the terms of our senior credit facility  we determined that our cash and cash equivalents at december  exceeded the defined amount by approximately million 
this amount will be paid in april and is reflected in the above table 
we have both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
the interest payments on our variable rate debt are based on a variable rate component plus a fixed 
including the fixed  we estimate that the interest rate on our variable rate debt will be   and for years through  respectively 
these estimates are based on interest rate projections used to price our interest rate swap agreements 
see footnote  long term obligations  in our consolidated financial statements provided under part ii  item of this annual report on form k for a more detailed discussion of these variable rate notes 
the table above excludes certain contractual arrangements whereby additional cash may be paid to former owners of acquired companies  including sti  upon attainment of specified performance targets 
we may be required to pay up to million in future periods if these performance targets are achieved 
we anticipate that our cash on hand  net cash provided by operations and  if needed  our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient cash resources to fund our contractual obligations and other cash needs for operations for more than the next months 
if we consummate one or more significant acquisitions during this period we may need to seek additional debt or equity financing 
debt covenants our senior credit facility contains certain financial covenants pertaining to interest coverage  fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios 
in addition  the senior credit facility has restrictions pertaining to capital expenditures  acquisitions and the payment of cash dividends 
in particular  the covenants limit our acquisition spending  without a waiver  to million per year plus up to million of any unused amount from the previous year 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
we currently believe the most restrictive covenant is the fixed charge coverage ratio 
the senior credit facility defines the fixed charge coverage ratio as that ratio which is calculated on a last month basis by dividing pro forma earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as defined by the agreement  by fixed charges 
fixed charges are defined as cash interest expense  scheduled principal payments on debt obligations  capital expenditures  and provision for income taxes 
at december   we had a fixed charge coverage ratio of to  which was in compliance with the required ratio of no less than to interest rate hedging agreements we entered into certain no fee swap agreements whereby we pay to counterparties amounts based on fixed interest rates and set notional principal amounts in exchange for the receipt of payments from the counterparties based on london interbank offer rates  libor  and the same set notional principal amounts 
a summary of these agreements is as follows 
table of contents swap agreements fixed interest rate notional amount million million effective date expiration date counterparties wells fargo bank goldman sachs we entered into these swap agreements to hedge against the risk of increasing interest rates 
the contracts effectively convert a certain amount of our variable rate debt under our senior credit facility to fixed rate debt for purposes of controlling cash paid for interest 
that amount is equal to the notional amount of the swap agreements and the fixed rate conversion period is equal to the terms of the contract 
the impact of these swap agreements has been factored into our future contractual cash requirements table above 
in the future  we may enter into additional interest rate strategies to take advantage of favorable current rate environments 
we have not yet determined what those strategies will be or their possible impact 
description of indebtedness senior credit facility at december   we had million principal amount outstanding under our senior term f notes and no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
we pay interest on our senior term f notes and our revolving credit facility based on the interest rate offered to our administrative agent on the london interbank market  or libor  plus an applicable margin 
for our senior term f notes  that margin is per annum and for our revolving credit facility that margin ranges from to per annum 
the senior term f notes mature in september and the revolving credit facility matures in september senior subordinated notes on november   vicar operating  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  issued million in principal amount of senior subordinated notes due december   which were exchanged on june  for substantially similar securities that are registered under the securities act 
interest on these senior subordinated notes is per annum  payable semi annually in arrears in cash 
at december   the outstanding principal balance of these senior subordinated notes was million 
we and each existing wholly owned subsidiary of vicar have jointly and severally  fully and unconditionally guaranteed these notes 
these guarantees are unsecured and subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness outstanding under the senior credit facility and any other indebtedness permitted to be incurred by vicar under the terms of the indenture agreement governing these notes 
beginning december   we can redeem all of our senior subordinated notes at of the principal amount 
pursuant to the terms of the indenture agreement  the redemption price decreases to on december   on december  and on december  other debt at december   we had seller notes secured by assets of animal hospitals  unsecured debt and capital leases that totaled million

 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including stock options  to be recognized as stock based compensation expense in our financial statements based on their fair values  beginning in the third quarter of sfas no 
r requires that we determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for stock based compensation expense and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
we have the option of adopting sfas no 
r prospectively or retroactively 
the prospective method requires us to begin recognizing compensation expense for all unvested stock options and other equity instruments in the third quarter of the retroactive method is the same as the prospective method but also permits us to restate our financial statements of previous periods based on pro forma disclosures made in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
r also requires that we record the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized stock based compensation expense as cash flows from financing activities rather than as cash flows from operating activities 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date 
we are unable to estimate this amount in future periods  however  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for those excess tax deductions was million   and  in  and  respectively 
we do not expect sfas no 
r to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the way we conduct our operations

 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  effective for fiscal years beginning after june   to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material or spoilage that may be incurred 
among other things  sfas no 
requires that these items be recognized as charges to expense in the periods incurred and clarifies that fixed production overhead costs be allocated to inventory based on normal production capacity 
unallocated overhead costs associated with abnormally low or high production in a given period should be charged to expense in that period 
sfas no

accounting for preexisting relationships between the parties to a business combination in october  the fasb ratified the emerging issues task force s  or eitf s  consensus on issue no 
 accounting for preexisting relationships between the parties to a business combination 
this consensus will require parties in a business combination that had a preexisting relationship to evaluate whether or not the acquisition resulted in the settlement of an existing contract  thus requiring accounting treatment separate from the business combination 
the consensus of eitf no 
must be applied as appropriate for our company beginning on january  we generally do not have preexisting contracts with the parties we acquire  and therefore  we do not expect that the 
table of contents application of eitf no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or the way we conduct our operations

on august   we effected a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend payable to stockholders of record as of august  all per share information included in the above table for quarters prior to september  have been restated to reflect the effect of the stock dividend 
although not readily detectable because of the impact of acquisitions  our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuation 
in particular  our revenue historically has been greater in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters 
the demand for our veterinary services is significantly higher during warmer months because pets spend a greater amount of time outdoors  where they are more likely to be injured and are more susceptible to disease and parasites 
in addition  use of veterinary services may be affected by levels of infestation of fleas  heartworms and ticks and the number of daylight hours 
a substantial portion of our costs are fixed and do not vary with the level of demand 
consequently  our operating income and operating margins generally have been higher for the second and third quarters than that experienced in the first and fourth quarters 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  that involve risks and uncertainties  as well as assumptions that  if they materialize or prove incorrect  could cause our results and the results of our consolidated subsidiaries to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
all statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be deemed forward looking statements  including any projections of earnings  revenue or other financial items  any statements of the plans  strategies and objectives of management for future operations  any statements concerning proposed new services or developments  any statements regarding the future economic conditions or performance  any statements of belief  and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing 
the risks  uncertainties and assumptions referred to above include the difficulty of managing our growth and integrating our new acquisitions and other risks that are described from time to time in our sec reports  including but not limited to the items discussed below under the caption  risk factors 

table of contents risk factors because of the factors set forth below  and the other cautionary language contained above and in other sections of this annual report  investors in our common stock should not assume that the forward looking statements contained in this annual report will prove to be a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use these forward looking statements to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
if we are unable to effectively execute our growth strategy  we may not achieve our desired economies of scale and our margins and profitability may decline 
our success depends in part on our ability to build on our position as a leading animal healthcare services company through a balanced program of internal growth initiatives and selective acquisitions of established animal hospitals  laboratories and related businesses 
if we cannot implement or effectively execute these initiatives and acquisitions  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
even if we effectively implement our growth strategy  we may not achieve the economies of scale that we have experienced in the past or that we anticipate having in the future 
for example  the animal hospitals we acquired as part of the acquisition of npc have not achieved the same gross profit margin as our animal hospitals that existed at the time we acquired npc 
in addition  our medical technology division  acquired in october  operates at significantly lower operating margins than either our laboratory or animal hospital divisions 
our internal growth rate may decline and could become negative 
our laboratory internal revenue growth has fluctuated between and for each fiscal year from through similarly  our animal hospital same store revenue growth rate has fluctuated between and over the same fiscal years 
our internal growth may continue to fluctuate and may be below our historical rates 
any reductions in the rate of our internal growth may cause our revenues and margins to decrease 
investors should not assume that our historical growth rates and margins are reliable indicators of results in future periods 
demand for certain products could decline as their product life cycle matures and the products become available in other channels of distribution such as retail oriented locations and through internet service providers 
this cycle could affect the frequency of veterinary visits and may result in a reduction in revenue 
demand for vaccinations may also be impacted in the future as protocols for vaccinations change 
vaccinations have been recommended by some in the profession to be given less frequently 
this may result in fewer visits and potentially less revenue 
vaccine protocols for our company are currently established by our veterinarians 
some of our veterinarians have changed their protocols and others may change their protocol in light of recent literature 
due to the fixed cost nature of our business  fluctuations in our revenue could adversely affect our operating income 
significantly more than a majority of our expense in  particularly rent and personnel costs  are fixed costs and are based in part on expectations of revenue 
we may be unable to reduce spending in a timely manner to compensate for any significant fluctuations in our revenue 
accordingly  shortfalls in revenue may adversely affect our operating income 
difficulties integrating new acquisitions may impose substantial costs and cause other problems for us 
our success depends on our ability to timely and cost effectively acquire  and integrate into our business  additional animal hospitals  laboratories and related businesses 
in  we acquired animal hospitals  in a single acquisition of npc  and a new medical technology division  a new business segment for us 
we expect to continue our acquisition program in all segments of our business 
if we acquire additional animal hospital chains in future periods  we will likely acquire a number of animal hospitals in that fiscal year significantly greater than the to animal hospitals that has been our goal in recent years 
in addition  we may acquire animal hospitals or laboratories in geographic territories where we do not have existing operations 
further  we may consider acquisitions of related businesses  such as the medical technology division we acquired in  in future periods 
any difficulties in the integration process may result in increased expense  loss of customers and a decline in profitability 
in some cases  we have experienced delays and increased costs in integrating acquired businesses  particularly where we acquire a large number of animal hospitals in a single region at or about the same time 
further  the expansion into new territories and new business segments result in risks to successful integration of the acquired businesses that are new to our operations 
as a consequence  our field management may spend a 
table of contents predominant amount of time integrating these new businesses and less time managing our existing businesses 
during these periods  there may be less attention directed to marketing efforts or staffing issues 
we also may experience delays in converting the systems of acquired businesses into our systems  which could result in increased payroll expense to collect our results and delays in reporting our results  both for a particular region and on a consolidated basis 
further  the legal and business environment prevalent in new territories and with respect to new businesses may pose risks that we do not anticipate and adversely impact our ability to integrate newly acquired operations 
for all of these reasons  our historical success in integrating acquired businesses is not a reliable indicator of our ability to do so in the future 
if we are not successful in timely and cost effectively integrating future acquisitions  it could result in decreased revenue  increased costs and lower margins 
we continue to face risks in connection with our acquisitions including negative effects on our operating results  impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets  dependence on retention  hiring and training of key personnel  including specialists  and contingent and latent risks associated with the past operations of  and other unanticipated problems arising in  an acquired business 
the process of integration may require a disproportionate amount of the time and attention of our management  which may distract management s attention from its day to day responsibilities 
in addition  any interruption or deterioration in service resulting from an acquisition may result in a customer s decision to stop using us 
for these reasons  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition  either at all or in a timely manner 
if that happens and we incur significant costs  it could have a material adverse impact on our business 
we face numerous risks associated with our acquisition of our medical technology division 
in october we acquired sti  which we now operate as our medical technology division 
this acquisition poses numerous risks  in addition to the risks discussed in the immediately preceding paragraphs 
sti distributes medical imaging equipment and related software and services 
our existing management has no experience in this industry and consequently may not be as effective in managing and overseeing these operations as in the case of business segments where they have significant operating experience 
advanced medical imaging equipment has not been widely adopted in the veterinary market and no clear market leader has emerged 
as advanced medical imaging equipment becomes more common in the veterinary industry and generates more significant aggregate revenues  the competition may increase  along with greater price pressures and demands for research and development and market differentiation 
our medical technology division does not manufacture the principal products it distributes and is dependent upon distribution agreements with the manufacturers of the equipment for its future business 
if these distribution agreements terminate and are not renewed  or if the manufacturers breach their covenants under these agreements  or the equipment manufactured by these manufacturers becomes less competitive  the demand for our products and services would decrease 
any reduction in demand could lead to fewer customer orders  reduced revenues  pricing pressures  reduced margins  reduced levels of profitability and loss of market share 
sti was a relatively young company at the time of our acquisition and lacked the financial and operating infrastructure and controls which we have in our other operations 
as part of the integration of sti into our operations  we will be required to expand its financial and operating infrastructure and strengthen its control environment to meet the standards that prevail in the remainder of our operations 
the failure to timely integrate this operation and achieve these objectives could result in an adverse impact on our revenues  margins and profitability 
the carrying value of our goodwill could be subject to impairment write down 
at december   our balance sheet reflected million of goodwill  which was a substantial portion of our total assets of million at that date 
we expect that the aggregate amount of goodwill on our balance sheet will increase as a result of future acquisitions 
we continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have 
table of contents occurred that suggest that the fair market value of each of our reporting units is below their carrying values 
if we determine that the fair market value of one of our reporting units is less than its carrying value  this may result in an impairment write down of the goodwill for that reporting unit 
the impairment write down would be reflected as expense and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations during the period in which we recognize the expense 
at december   we concluded that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value and accordingly  as of that date  our goodwill was not impaired in our consolidated financial statements 
however  in the future we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded or arising out of future acquisitions 
we require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and expand our business as planned 
we have  and will continue to have  a substantial amount of debt 
our substantial amount of debt requires us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to pay down our indebtedness and related interest  thereby reducing the funds available to use for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
at december   our debt consisted of million in principal amount outstanding under our senior term f notes  million in principal amount outstanding under our senior subordinated notes  and million in principal amount outstanding under our other debt 
our ability to make payments on our debt  and to fund acquisitions  will depend upon our ability to generate cash in the future 
insufficient cash flow could place us at risk of default under our debt agreements or could prevent us from expanding our business as planned 
our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations  our strategy to increase operating efficiencies may not be realized and future borrowings may not be available to us under our senior credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs 
in order to meet our debt obligations  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt 
we may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our debt instruments may adversely affect our ability to run our business 
our substantial amount of debt  as well as the guarantees of our subsidiaries and the security interests in our assets and those of our subsidiaries  could impair our ability to operate our business effectively and may limit our ability to take advantage of business opportunities 
for example  our indenture and senior credit facility limit our funds available to repay the senior subordinated notes  limit our ability to borrow additional funds or to obtain other financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  investments and general corporate purposes  limit our ability to dispose of our assets  create liens on our assets or to extend credit  make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business or industry  place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors with less debt  and 
table of contents restrict our ability to pay dividends  repurchase or redeem our capital stock or debt  or merge or consolidate with another entity 
the terms of our indenture and senior credit facility allow us  under specified conditions  to incur further indebtedness  which would heighten the foregoing risks 
if compliance with our debt obligations materially hinders our ability to operate our business and adapt to changing industry conditions  we may lose market share  our revenue may decline and our operating results may suffer 
our failure to satisfy covenants in our debt instruments will cause a default under those instruments 
in addition to imposing restrictions on our business and operations  our debt instruments include a number of covenants relating to financial ratios and tests 
our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions 
the breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under these instruments 
an event of default would permit our lenders and other debtholders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable  together with accrued and unpaid interest 
moreover  these lenders and other debtholders would have the option to terminate any obligation to make further extensions of credit under these instruments 
if we are unable to repay debt to our senior lenders  these lenders and other debtholders could proceed against our assets 
the significant competition in the companion animal healthcare services industry could cause us to reduce prices or lose market share 
the companion animal healthcare services industry is highly competitive with few barriers to entry 
to compete successfully  we may be required to reduce prices  increase our operating costs or take other measures that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  margins and cash flow 
if we are unable to compete successfully  we may lose market share 
there are many clinical laboratory companies that provide a broad range of laboratory testing services in the same markets we service 
our largest competitor for outsourced laboratory testing services is idexx laboratories  inc  or idexx 
idexx currently competes or intends to compete in most of the same markets in which we operate 
in this regard  idexx has recently acquired additional laboratories in the markets in which we operate and has announced plans to continue this expansion and aggressively bundles all of their products and services to compete with us 
increased competition may lead to pressures on the revenues and margins of our laboratory operations 
also  idexx and several other national companies provide on site diagnostic equipment that allows veterinarians to perform their own laboratory tests 
our primary competitors for our animal hospitals in most markets are individual practitioners or small  regional  multi clinic practices 
also  regional pet care companies and some national companies  including operators of super stores  are developing multi regional networks of animal hospitals in markets in which we operate 
historically  when a competing animal hospital opens in proximity to one of our hospitals  we have reduced prices  expanded our facility  retained additional qualified personnel  increased our marketing efforts or taken other actions designed to retain and expand our client base 
as a result  our revenue may decline and our costs may increase 
our medical technology division is a relatively new entrant in the market for medical imaging equipment in the animal healthcare industry 
our primary competitors are companies that are much larger than us and have substantially greater capital  manufacturing  marketing and research and development resources than we do  including companies such as siemens  phillips and canon 
the success of our medical technology division  in part  is due to its focus on the veterinary market  which allows it to differentiate its products and services to meet the unique needs of this market 
if this market receives more focused attention from these larger competitors  we may find it difficult to compete and as a result our revenues and operating margins could decline 
if we fail to compete successfully in this market  the demand for our products and services would decrease 
any reduction in demand could lead to fewer customer orders  reduced revenues  pricing pressures  reduced margins  reduced levels of profitability and loss of market share 
these competitive pressures could adversely affect our business and operating results 

table of contents we may experience difficulties hiring skilled veterinarians due to shortages that could disrupt our business 
as the pet population continues to grow  the need for skilled veterinarians continues to increase 
if we are unable to retain an adequate number of skilled veterinarians  we may lose customers  our revenue may decline and we may need to sell or close animal hospitals 
as of december   there were veterinary schools in the country accredited by the american veterinary medical association 
these schools graduate approximately  veterinarians per year 
there is a shortage of skilled veterinarians in some regional markets in which we operate animal hospitals 
during shortages in these regions  we may be unable to hire enough qualified veterinarians to adequately staff our animal hospitals  in which event we may lose market share and our revenues and profitability may decline 
if we fail to comply with governmental regulations applicable to our business  various governmental agencies may impose fines  institute litigation or preclude us from operating in certain states 
the laws of many states prohibit business corporations from providing  or holding themselves out as providers of  veterinary medical care 
these laws vary from state to state and are enforced by the courts and by regulatory authorities with broad discretion 
as of december   we operated animal hospitals in states with these laws  including in new york and in texas 
in addition  our mobile imaging service also operates in states with these laws 
we may experience difficulty in expanding our operations into other states with similar laws 
given varying and uncertain interpretations of the veterinary laws of each state  we may not be in compliance with restrictions on the corporate practice of veterinary medicine in all states 
a determination that we are in violation of applicable restrictions on the practice of veterinary medicine in any state in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on us  particularly if we were unable to restructure our operations to comply with the requirements of that state 
all of the states in which we operate impose various registration requirements 
to fulfill these requirements  we have registered each of our facilities with appropriate governmental agencies and  where required  have appointed a licensed veterinarian to act on behalf of each facility 
all veterinarians practicing in our clinics are required to maintain valid state licenses to practice 
any failure in our information technology systems or disruption in our transportation network including disruption resulting from terrorist activities could significantly increase testing turn around time  reduce our production capacity and otherwise disrupt our operations 
our laboratory operations depend  in part  on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems and transportation network 
our growth has necessitated continued expansion and upgrade of our information technology systems and transportation network 
sustained system failures or interruption in our transportation network or in one or more of our laboratory operations could disrupt our ability to process laboratory requisitions  perform testing  provide test results in a timely manner and or bill the appropriate party 
we could lose customers and revenue as a result of a system or transportation network failure 
our computer systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources  including telecommunications failures  electricity brownouts or blackouts  malicious human acts and natural disasters 
moreover  despite network security measures  some of our servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electrical break ins  computer viruses and similar disruptive problems 
despite the precautions we have taken  unanticipated problems affecting our systems could cause interruptions in our information technology systems 
our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures in our systems 
in addition  over time we have significantly customized the computer systems in our laboratory business 
we rely on a limited number of employees to upgrade and maintain these systems 
if we were to lose the services of some or all of these employees  it may be time consuming for new employees to become familiar with our systems  and we may experience disruptions in service during these periods 
any substantial reduction in the number of available flights or delays in the departure of flights  whether as a result of severe weather conditions  a terrorist attack or any other type of disruption  will disrupt our transportation network and our ability to provide test results in a timely manner 
any change in government regulation related to 
table of contents transporting samples or specimens could also have an impact on our business 
in addition  our test express service  which services customers outside of major metropolitan areas  is dependent on flight services in and out of memphis and the transportation network of federal express 
any sustained interruption in either flight services in memphis or the transportation network of federal express would result in increased turn around time for the reporting of test results to customers serviced by our test express service 
our use of a self insurance program and a large deductible insurance program cover certain claims for losses suffered and costs or expenses incurred could negatively impact our business upon the occurrence of an uninsured and  or significant event 
we have adopted a program of self insurance with regard to certain risks such as earthquakes and other natural disasters 
in addition  our other insurance programs including  but not limited to  hurricanes  floods  health benefits and workers compensation include large deductible provisions 
we self insure and use large deductible insurance programs when the lack of availability and  or high cost of commercially available insurance products do not make the transfer of this risk a reasonable approach 
in the event that the frequency of losses experienced by us increased unexpectedly  the aggregate of such losses could materially increase our liability and adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 
in addition  while the insurance market continues to limit the availability of certain insurance products while increasing the costs of such products  we will continue to evaluate the levels of claims we include in our self insurance program and large deductible insurance program 
any increases to these programs increase our risk of exposure and therefore increases the risk of a possible material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 
in addition  we have made certain judgments as to the limits on our existing insurance coverage that we believe are in line with industry standards  as well as in light of economic and availability considerations 
unforeseen catastrophic loss scenarios could prove our limits to be inadequate  and losses incurred in connection with the known claims we self insure could be substantial 
either of these circumstances could materially adversely affect our financial and business condition 
the loss of mr 
robert antin  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  could materially and adversely affect our business 
we are dependent upon the management and leadership of our chairman  president and chief executive officer  robert antin 
we have an employment contract with mr 
antin that may be terminated at the option of mr 
antin 
we do not maintain any key man life insurance coverage for mr 
antin 
the loss of mr 
antin could materially adversely affect our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we had borrowings of million under our senior credit facility with fluctuating interest rates based on market benchmarks such as libor 
to reduce the risk of increasing interest rates  we enter into no fee interest rate swap agreements 
currently  we are engaged in two agreements  both agreements are for million and commenced on may  and expire on may  these swap agreements have the effect of reducing the amount of our debt exposed to variable interest rates 
accordingly  for the month period ending december   for every increase in libor we will pay an additional million in interest expense and for every decrease in libor we will save million in interest expense 
we are considering entering into additional interest rate strategies to take advantage of the current rate environment 
we have not yet determined what those strategies may be or their possible impact
