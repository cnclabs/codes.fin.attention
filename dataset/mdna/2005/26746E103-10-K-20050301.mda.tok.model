item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel biotherapeutics for unmet medical needs  with an emphasis on cancer and inflammatory indications 
we currently have two product candidates in or entering into phase ii clinical trials for three indications  and we are planning to initiate a phase iii trial of our lead product candidate in the first half of dx  a specific inhibitor of human plasma kallikrein  is being evaluated in phase ii trials for its potential to treat hereditary angioedema hae  a rare and life threatening inflammatory disease 
the dx trials in hae are being conducted by us in a joint venture with genzyme corporation 
independently  we are advancing dx into phase ii trials in cardiac surgery  initially for its potential to reduce blood loss and related complications during on pump  open heart surgery  specifically coronary artery bypass graft  or cabg  surgery 
dx  a specific inhibitor of human neutrophil elastase  is being evaluated in phase ii clinical trials for its potential in the treatment of cystic fibrosis cf 
the cf clinical trials are being conducted by debiopharm sa  our collaborator for this program 
both dx and dx have received orphan drug designation in the united states of america us and european union  and dx has been granted fast track designation by the us food and drug administration fda for the treatment of hae 
dx and dx were identified using our patented phage display technology  which rapidly selects antibodies  peptides and small proteins that bind with high affinity and specificity to therapeutic targets 
we are using this technology to build a pipeline of drug candidates that we may advance into clinical development on our own or in partnership with other companies 
we also leverage phage display technology broadly through collaborations and licenses that are structured to generate revenues through research funding  license fees  technical and clinical milestone payments  and royalties 
currently  over companies and research institutions  including amgen inc  biogen idec  inc  genzyme corporation  imclone systems  inc  human genome sciences  inc  medimmune  inc 
and tanox  inc  have licenses to use our phage display technology and phage display derived compounds to research and develop therapeutic  diagnostic and other products 
we continued to incur losses in and expect to incur significant operating losses over at least the next several years as we continue our current and anticipated development projects  particularly our clinical trial programs for dx  and as we develop our discovery  research  marketing  sales and manufacturing capabilities 
clinical development programs dx for hae 
in collaboration with genzyme  we are developing dx as a treatment for hae 
this collaboration is managed through dyax genzyme llc formerly known as kallikrein llc  a jointly owned limited liability company 
currently  we are conducting an open label  repeat dose phase ii clinical trial known as edema edema is a multi center trial with investigational sites in the us and canada 
we also plan to initiate a phase iii clinical trial of dx for the treatment of hae  referred to as edema  during the first half of if the edema trial is successful and completed on schedule  we  together with genzyme  currently anticipate filing a bla for dx for the treatment of hae in the united states and an equivalent marketing authorization application for dx for the treatment of hae in the european union in based upon this timeline for the bla filing  we estimate dyax genzyme llc s total remaining costs to commercialization to be in the range of million to million 
we will be responsible for funding one half of these costs  or million to million 
these costs include costs associated with the development of a subcutaneous formulation of dx for at home use 
the following table illustrates the activity associated with dx for hae included in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss years ended december  in thousands dx for hae costs included within research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss less research and development expenses reimbursed by joint venture dyax genzyme llc per the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss net research and development expenses for dx for hae equity loss in joint venture dyax genzyme llc separately classified within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss net loss on dx for hae program during  our research and development expenses on this program totaled million compared with million in and million in research and development expenses increased year over year principally due to increased activity in the areas of manufacturing and preclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies 
in addition  net research and development expenses increased from to due to the initiation of the edema trial in dyax genyzme llc is responsible for the reimbursement of all development expenses related to the hae program incurred after the completion of the first phase ii clinical trial for hae  which occurred in during  dyax genzyme llc reimbursed us for million of our expenses 
this reimbursement is recorded as research and development expenses reimbursed by joint venture dyax genzyme llc in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
in  dyax genzyme llc reimbursed us million for our expenses relating to the program 
the million of net research and development expenses in for dx for hae represent costs incurred prior to the completion of the first phase ii clinical trial for hae  which therefore were not reimbursed 
all future costs will be reimbursed by dyax genzyme llc 
dyax genzyme llc had a net loss of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and this loss represents the total research and development expenses incurred by dyax and genzyme on dx for hae 
our portion of the loss  accounted for under the equity method  was million and million for the years ended december  and and is proportional to our financial interest in the program and is separately classified within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
dx for cabg 
independent of our collaboration with genzyme  we are developing dx as a treatment for patients undergoing on pump  open heart surgery  specifically coronary artery bypass graft  or cabg  surgery 
during the first quarter of  we exercised an option to purchase from genzyme full rights to dx for this and other surgical indications 
the cost for exercising the option was million and was expensed in the second quarter of expenses on this program totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in spending from to is attributable to an increase in market research  preclinical studies and manufacturing expenses in addition to an increase in headcount related costs 
during there was additional spending attributable to a  increase in market research costs  a  increase in personnel related costs and a  increase in other expenses all of which were associated with developing the clinical plan and identifying a suitable partner for the program 
preclinical studies and the associated manufacturing expenses increased  in the total increase in expenses on this program from to was offset by the one time  million payment made to genzyme for its interest in the application of dx for surgical indications in the increase in spending from to is primarily attributable to the million payment made to genzyme in subject to the successful completion of ongoing negotiations to partner this indication with another company  we are planning to conduct a phase ii trial in the united states to compare dx to aprotinin  currently marketed by bayer ag under the name trasylol  for reduction of blood loss in cabg patients 
the trial  to be conducted in the united states  is currently planned to involve approximately patients 
as currently designed  we expect this trial to cost approximately million to million 
following an interim analysis of the data generated from this comparative trial  we may expand it into a larger clinical trial  which would entail significant additional costs 
dx for cystic fibrosis 
in collaboration with debiopharm sa  dx is being developed as a treatment for cystic fibrosis  a fatal genetic mutation that causes problems including progressive lung destruction and frequent infections 
debiopharm has completed two phase iia clinical trials with dx in europe  one in adult and one in pediatric cystic fibrosis patients  and has recently initiated a placebo controlled phase iib clinical trial for cystic fibrosis 
we are currently negotiating with debiopharm to amend our collaboration agreement in order to provide debiopharm worldwide rights to independently develop and commercialize dx for cystic fibrosis and ards 
under the proposed amendment  we would receive milestones and royalties from debiopharm in connection with its ongoing development of dx we would also receive worldwide rights to commercialize our independently developed  long acting  pegylated form of dx known as peg dx 
currently  we are exploring the potential for advancing peg dx into development for other pulmonary indications  which could include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd and alpha antitrypsin deficiency 
during  we incurred research  development and manufacturing expenses on this program of million compared with million in research and development expenses on this program increased from principally due to an increase in manufacturing costs 
these costs were fully funded by debiopharm and this funding is reflected in our product development revenues 
under our existing collaboration agreement  debiopharm is responsible for the management of all preclinical and clinical trials  and all costs associated with such trials and any costs incurred by dyax in connection with the manufacture and testing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for dx are fully funded by debiopharm 
this financial structure could be altered if we were to amend our collaboration agreement with debiopharm and allow them to independently assume responsibility for the clinical development of dx for cystic fibrosis 
goals for clinical development programs 
our goal for each of our ongoing clinical development programs is to obtain marketing approval from the fda and analogous international regulatory agencies 
because of uncertainties associated with our ongoing clinical trials  our ability to locate a development partner or obtain the additional funding needed to complete clinical trials in the cabg and dx programs  the preparation and filing of a bla  the regulatory review process  and the risks associated with the clinical approval process  including the risk that we may have to repeat  revise or expand the scope of trials or conduct additional clinical trials not presently planned to secure marketing approvals  we are unable to accurately predict the costs to complete any of these programs  the completion dates  or whether these projects will be successfully completed at all 
material cash inflows for any of these programs other than milestone payments will not commence until after marketing approvals are obtained  and then only if the product candidate finds acceptance in the marketplace as a treatment for its disease indication 
because of the many risks and uncertainties relating to the completion of clinical trials  receipt of marketing approvals and acceptance in the marketplace  we cannot predict when material cash inflows from these programs will commence  if ever 
discovery programs through internal discovery activities and through business relationships with academic institutions and private biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  we use our proprietary phage display technology to identify compounds with therapeutic and diagnostic potential 
we have a total of seven discovery and development programs underway in oncology  three of which are in collaboration with other companies 
these programs are focused on the discovery and development of therapies that fight cancer primarily in three ways inhibiting angiogenesis the growth of blood vessels  inhibiting proteases believed to be associated with tumor growth and proliferation  and targeting cell surface proteins believed to be over expressed by certain tumors 
we also have four discovery and development programs focused on targets that are believed to be important mediators of inflammation  one of which we are developing in collaboration with another company 
in addition  in collaboration with another company  we have a discovery and development program focused on an infectious disease target 
licensing and funded research activities currently  over companies and research institutions have licenses to use our proprietary phage display technology and phage display libraries 
these licenses allow others to exploit our technology in therapeutic discovery and in non core areas such as diagnostic imaging  research reagents and separations 
in addition  we perform funded research for collaborators within the biopharmaceutical industry 
we believe that these programs provide support for our patent position in phage display and for the usefulness of phage display as an enabling discovery technology 
additionally  these programs generate short term and long term value for us through licensing fees  milestones and royalties 
sale of separations business on october   we completed the sale of our wholly owned separations product subsidiary known as biotage for a gross purchase price of million 
the sale of biotage has allowed us to focus exclusively on biotherapeutics  and the cash generated by the sale of biotage helped us advance our clinical programs as well as the preclinical candidates in our pipeline 
we received approximately million in cash at closing and paid approximately million in transaction expenses 
an additional million was received in that was being held in an indemnity escrow 
for the year ended december   we have recognized a million gain on this sale 
for the years ended december  and  operations of biotage are presented as discontinued operations in our financial statements 
prior period amounts have been reclassified to be consistent with the treatment of biotage as a discontinued operation 
results of operations revenues 
substantially all our revenues have come from licensing  funded research and development activities  including milestone payments from our licensees and collaborators 
these revenues fluctuate from year to year 
total revenues for were million  compared with million in and million in the decrease from to was due to a million decrease in funded research and development activities and a million increase in licensing activities 
our decrease in funded research and development revenue was due to a million decrease from a funded research agreement with bracco imaging spa and a million decrease from a funded research agreement with human genome sciences  inc hgs the agreement with hgs was completed in june these decreases in funded research and development activities were partially offset by a million increase in revenue arising from our dx product collaboration with debiopharm 
on a period to period basis our dx manufacturing revenue may vary substantially due to the timing of production activities 
our increase in licensing revenue was primarily due to revenue recognized for new licenses of our proprietary phage display libraries and milestones under existing licenses 
the decrease from to was primarily due to a million decrease from a funded research agreement with hgs 
this decrease was partially offset by a  increase in other licensing and funded research agreements 
research and development 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and  are summarized as follows year ended december  in thousands research and development per consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss less research and development expenses reimbursed by joint venture dyax genzyme llc per consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss net  research and development expenses per consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss equity loss in joint venture dyax genzyme llc separately classified within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss pro forma research and development expenses our research and development expenses arise primarily from compensation and other related costs  including personnel dedicated to research and development activities and from the fees paid and costs reimbursed to outside professionals to conduct research  clinical trials  and to manufacture drug compounds prior to fda approval 
since mid  the expenses we incur on the dx program for hae are included in our overall research and development expenses  but then are reimbursed by the dyax genzyme llc joint venture and excluded from net research and development expenses 
however  we jointly fund the losses of that program with genzyme  so our line item for equity loss in joint venture represents our share of the expenses for the development of dx for hae  including any incurred by genzyme 
combining our net research and development expenses and our equity loss in joint venture to show our total expenses for research and development  our pro forma research and development expenses increased million from to due to increases in both items 
the million increase in net research and development expenses was the result of an approximately million increase in headcount and associated personnel and occupancy costs  primarily to support our discovery pipeline 
compared to  manufacturing costs associated with our dx for cf program increased million and manufacturing  and marketing and other external costs associated with our dx for cabg program increased million  exclusive of the cost of exercising a million option to purchase from genzyme the rights to dx for cabg and other surgical indications  which occurred in equity loss in joint venture dyax genzyme llc increased million primarily due to an increase in manufacturing expenses  ongoing pharmacology and toxicology studies  as well as increased clinical trial costs and the associated internal costs to support these activities 
pro forma research and development expenses decreased from to primarily due to reduced headcount at the end of and the reimbursement of hae expenses by dyax genzyme llc effective april our management believes that the above presentation of pro forma research and development expenses provides investors a better understanding of how total research and development efforts affect our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
our presentation of this measure  however  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs of our management and administrative staff  as well as expenses related to business development  protecting our intellectual property  administrative occupancy  professional fees  market research and promotion activities and the reporting requirements of a public company 
total general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in and million for the increase of million from to was primarily due to an increase in professional fees  including approximately  in costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance and internal headcount 
the decrease of million from to was primarily due to a million decrease in employment costs  partially attributable to the effects of lower headcount and a  decrease in legal costs 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in the cost of directors and officers insurance 
discontinued operations 
our activities from discontinued operations are the operations our wholly owned separations product subsidiary known as biotage  which were sold on october  including the gain on the sale of biotage 
the gain was comprised of a million gain on sale and a loss of million on biotage s operations for the year to date period ended october   compared to a loss on operations of  for the million increase in loss on operations from to the period were primarily due to a decrease in revenues in non core product lines  specifically biotage s kiloprep and flex systems 
liquidity and capital resources we require cash to fund our operating expenses  to make capital expenditures  acquisitions and investments  and to pay debt service 
through december   we have funded our operations principally through the sale of equity securities  which have provided aggregate net cash proceeds since inception of approximately million  including net proceeds of million from our january underwritten offering  million from our march registered directed offering and million from our august initial public offering 
we have also generated funds from biopharmaceutical product development and license fee revenues  our sale of our biotage subsidiary in that raised million in cash with another million received in  separations product revenues of our former biotage division  interest income  long term obligations and other sources 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments aggregating million 
our excess funds are currently invested in short term investments primarily consisting of us treasury notes and bills  obligations of us government agencies and money market funds backed by us treasury obligations 
our operating activities used cash of approximately million in  million in and million in our cash used in operating activities for consisted primarily of our net loss from continuing operations of million  partially offset by adjustments for non cash items  including depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and intangibles totaling million and equity loss in joint venture dyax genzyme llc of million  and a million change in operating assets and liabilities 
our cash used in operating activities for consisted primarily of our net loss from continuing operations of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million due to the timing of billings to debiopharm under our collaboration agreement  and an increase in prepaid expense and other assets of million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million due primarily to the timing of payments made to our contract manufacturer and adjustments for non cash items  including depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and intangibles totaling million and equity loss in joint venture dyax genzyme llc of million 
the activities for consisted primarily of our net loss from continuing operations of million  a decrease in deferred revenue of million due primarily to the timing of revenue recognition on our collaboration with debiopharm  and an increase in prepaid expense and other assets of million 
these decreases were partially offset by proceeds from incentives given to us by our landlord for enticement to enter our lease in cambridge  massachusetts and depreciation and amortization costs totaling million 
our investing activities used cash totaling million in  provided cash of million in and used cash of million in our cash used in investing activities for the included the purchase of million of short term investments  million contributed to dyax genzyme llc and million in fixed asset purchases 
these uses were partially offset by received from the escrow relating to the sale of biotage 
our investing activities for included the million received on the sale of biotage  repayments on employee notes receivable of million  including approximately million received from our chief executive officer as full payment on the related note which were partially offset by million paid to dyax genzyme llc and payment of million for licensed technology purchased in our investing activities for included the purchases of fixed assets relating to our move to a new corporate and research facility in cambridge totaling million  million spent on a purchase of licensed technology and a million increase in restricted cash to secure long term obligations 
the following table summarizes our cash contributions to and investment in our joint venture  dyax genzyme llc in thousands balance at december  per the consolidated balance sheets investment in joint venture dyax genzyme llc per the consolidated statement of cash flows equity loss in joint venture dyax genzyme llc separately classified within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss balance at december  per the consolidated balance sheets our financing activities provided cash of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our financing activities for included net proceeds of million from the sale of our common stock  including million from our january offering and million in new long term obligations 
these increases in cash were partially offset by the repayments of long term obligations of million 
our financing activities for included net proceeds of million from the registered directed offering completed in march these proceeds were partly offset by repayments of long term obligations of million 
our financing activities for included a million loan from genzyme under the terms of our collaboration agreement  as well as proceeds of million from our cambridge landlord for leasehold improvements 
these proceeds were partially offset by million in repayments of long term obligations 
we have financed fixed asset purchases through capital leases and debt 
capital lease obligations are collateralized by the assets under lease 
in conjunction with our collaboration agreement with genzyme for the development of dx  genzyme loaned us million pursuant to a senior secured promissory note and security agreement  and we granted genzyme a continuing security interest in certain tangible and intangible personal property arising out of the dx program 
in addition  the security agreement  as amended contains certain financial covenants under which we must i maintain at least million in cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities based on the company s quarterly consolidated financial statements and ii continue to satisfy at least one standard for continued listing of our securities on the nasdaq national market 
the principal and all unpaid interest is due on the maturity date of may  we may extend the maturity date to may  if the amended collaboration agreement is in effect  no default or event of default exists and we satisfy the financial covenants as of may  as of december   we satisfied the criteria for extending the maturity date of the note to may  and intend to extend the maturity date 
accordingly  the note is classified as a long term liability in the consolidated balance sheet 
we have borrowed the full million available under the note  the terms of which are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments plus anticipated cash flow from product development  license fees and collaborations will be sufficient to support our current operating plans into we expect to use approximately million in cash during for the foreseeable future  we expect to continue to fund any deficit from our operations through the sale of additional equity or debt securities 
the sale of any equity or debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain any required additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned research  development and commercialization activities  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements with the exception of operating leases 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities which we cannot reasonably predict future payment 
the following chart represents our total contractual obligations  including principal and interest  at december   aggregated by type in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years obligation to related party capital leases leasehold improvement arrangements operating lease obligations patent and product license obligations obligation for research  development and manufacturing total contractual obligations these amounts exclude any royalties and milestones that we may owe in connection with the development or commercialization of any of our product candidates 
since the prospect of development and commercialization of any particular product candidate is uncertain  we believe the timing and amounts of any potential royalties and other milestones are not currently calculable in any manner that would fairly present purchase obligations 
these amounts represent the cash commitment due on research  development and manufacturing contracts 
we will not owe any royalties or milestones in connection with these contracts 
in addition  we have received a grant from the walloon region of belgium 
this grant includes specific criteria regarding employment and investment levels that need to be met through if we do not meet the criteria  we will be required to refund all or a portion of amounts received under this grant 
as of december   we have received million under this grant 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  receivable collectibles  useful lives with respect to long lived and intangible assets and valuation of common stock  related stock options  and deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from our estimates 
we believe that our judgment and assumptions with respect to the following significant accounting policies are most critical to the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we make significant assumptions and estimates relating to revenue recognition  which include the expected term of the agreement and total expected cost 
our assumptions and estimates may prove to be inaccurate 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our estimates  any significant unanticipated changes in our estimates could have a material impact on revenues and our results of operations 
our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we enter into biopharmaceutical product development agreements with collaborators for the research and development of therapeutic  diagnostic and other products 
the terms of the agreements may include non refundable signing and licensing fees  funding for research and development  milestone payments and royalties on any product sales derived from the collaborations 
non refundable signing and licensing fees are recognized as services are performed over the expected term of the collaboration 
funding for research and development  where the amounts recorded are non refundable  is recognized as the related expenses are incurred 
we evaluate all collaborative agreements on a quarterly basis to determine the appropriate revenue recognition for that period 
the evaluation includes all of the potential revenue components from each specific collaborative agreement 
upon achievement of milestones  a portion of the milestone payment equal to the percentage of the collaboration completed through that date is recognized 
the remainder is recognized as services are performed over the remaining term of the collaboration 
royalties are recognized when earned 
we generally license our patent rights covering phage display as well as our proprietary phage display libraries on a non exclusive basis to third parties for use in connection with the research and development of therapeutic  diagnostic  and other products 
standard terms of the license patent rights agreements  for which we have no future obligations  generally include non refundable signing fees  non refundable license maintenance fees  development milestone payments and royalties on product sales 
signing fees and maintenance fees are recognized ratably over the period to which the payment applies 
perpetual patent licenses are recognized immediately if we have no future obligations 
standard terms of the proprietary phage display libraries agreements generally include non refundable signing fees  non refundable license maintenance fees  development milestone payments and royalties on product sales 
signing fees and maintenance fees are recognized ratably over the period to which the payment applies  which is normally between and years  but have been determined to be up to years 
upon the achievement of milestones under non exclusive phage display patent licenses and phage display libraries a portion of the milestone equal payment to the percentage of the license agreement that has elapsed is recognized as revenue 
milestone payments under these license arrangements are recognized when the milestone is achieved if the company has no future obligations under the license  and royalties are recognized when they are earned 
payments received that have not met the appropriate criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
at december  and  our deferred revenue related to product development agreements was million and million  respectively 
of the million deferred at december   million  million and  is expected to be recognized as revenue in  and respectively  and the remaining is expected to be recognized over the next years 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze our accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our accounts receivable balance net of allowances for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december  and the provision for doubtful accounts was  valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
we review long lived assets  including capitalized license rights  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant change relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant industry or economic trends and developments 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flow to the recorded value of the asset 
when it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis 
our intangible assets at the end of consisted of licenses for antibody technology from third parties 
the balance of our other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization was million and million at december  and  respectively 
no impairment losses have been recognized in any of the periods presented in our consolidated financial statements 
related party transactions our chairman  president and chief executive officer also serves as an outside director of genzyme corporation and was a consultant to genzyme until one of our other directors is a member of genzyme s directors and another was a senior advisor to the chief executive officer of genzyme and a former officer 
we have a collaboration agreement with genzyme for the development and commercialization of dx under this agreement  which was amended on may   and again effective as of september   we were initially responsible for all expenses incurred in connection with the development of dx for the treatment of hae through the completion of the first phase ii clinical trial for hae  which occurred in the second quarter of in june  genzyme exercised its option under the collaboration agreement to join us in the development and commercialization of dx for hae 
through the creation of dyax genzyme llc formerly known as kallikrein llc  dyax and genzyme now jointly own the rights to dx for the treatment of hae 
dyax and genzyme are each responsible for of ongoing costs incurred in connection with the development and commercialization of dx for hae and each will be entitled to receive approximately of any profits realized as a result 
in addition  we are entitled to receive potential milestone payments from genzyme in connection with the development of dx the first such milestone payment  approximately million  is due upon dosing the first patient in a pivotal clinical trial of dx for hae  which we anticipate will occur during in addition  we will be entitled to receive potential milestone payments of million for the first fda approved product derived from dx  and up to million for additional therapeutic indications developed under the collaboration 
under this collaboration agreement  we had the option to purchase genzyme s interest in the application of dx for the prevention of blood loss and other systemic inflammatory responses in on pump  open heart surgery and other surgical indications for million 
we exercised this option in the first quarter of when the company and genzyme first amended the collaboration agreement in may  the company and genzyme also executed a senior secured promissory note under which genzyme agreed to loan us up to million 
under a security agreement associated with this note  we agreed to grant genzyme a continuing security interest in certain tangible and intangible personal property arising out of the dx program  including all intellectual property rights related to dx for non surgical applications 
under an amendment to the security agreement executed on october   genzyme was granted a continuing security interest in our rights to revenues from licenses of our fundamental phage display patent portfolio 
the security agreement  as amended  contains certain financial covenants  under which we must i maintain at least million in cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities based on the company s quarterly consolidated financial statements and ii continue to satisfy at least one standard for continued listing of our securities on the nasdaq national market 
on october   we received the million under this genzyme note 
the note bears interest at the prime rate at december  plus 
interest is payable quarterly 
the principal and all unpaid interest will be due on the maturity date of may  we may extend the maturity date to may  if the amended collaboration agreement is in effect  no default or event of default exists and we satisfy the financial covenants as of may  as of december   we satisfy the criteria for extending the maturity date of the note to may  and intend to extend the maturity date 
accordingly  we have presented the note as a long term liability as an obligation to related party on our consolidated balance sheet 
at december  and  there was million outstanding under the loan 
at december  and  we owed  and  respectively  of interest on this note  which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to current nature of this liability 
all research and development expenses incurred by each party related to the hae program are billed to and reimbursed by dyax genzyme llc 
both genzyme and we are each required to fund of the actual monthly expenses of dyax genzyme llc  as needed 
we have accounted for our interest in dyax genzyme llc using the equity method of accounting 
under this method  the reimbursement of expenses to us is recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses because it includes funding that we provided to dyax genzyme llc 
our share of dyax genzyme llc loss is recorded as an equity loss in joint venture dyax genzyme llc in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
at december  and  our investment in the joint venture was  and  respectively  which is recorded as an investment in joint venture dyax genzyme llc in the consolidated balance sheets 
we have evaluated this agreement to determine if the related joint venture qualifies as a variable interest entity under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
both we and genzyme fund the operations of dyax genzyme llc on a monthly basis and therefore under paragraph a of fin r  the joint venture qualifies as a variable interest entity because its total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
we have a financial interest in dyax genzyme llc 
however  based on our analysis of the agreement  we believe that our exposure to the expected losses of dyax genzyme llc are less than genzyme s and therefore we are not the primary beneficiary of dyax genzyme llc under paragraph of fin r 
accordingly  we have not consolidated dyax genzyme llc 
during  we signed two patent license agreements with genzyme under our standard license terms 
we recorded license revenues of  for each year ended december   and  in connection with the maintenance fees on these two agreements 
as of december  and  there were no outstanding accounts receivable due from genzyme related to the patent license agreements 
during  we signed a library license agreement with genzyme consistent with our standard license terms 
we received million from genzyme and recorded license revenues of  for the year ended december   in connection with the technology access fees on this agreement 
of the million received under this agreement  approximately million has not been recognized as revenue and is included in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet 
this amount will be recognized ratably over the next months 
as of december   there was no accounts receivable balance related to the library license agreement tax loss carryforwards as of december   we had federal net operating loss nol and research and experimentation credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which may be available to offset future federal income tax liabilities and expire at various dates from through we have recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately million reflecting the benefit of deductions from the exercise of stock options 
this deferred asset has been fully reserved until it is more likely than not that the benefit from the exercise of stock options will be realized 
the benefit from this million deferred tax asset will be recorded as a credit to additional paid in capital when realized

 our management has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets  which are comprised principally of nol and research and experimentation credit carryforwards 
management has determined at this time that it is more likely than not that we will not recognize the benefits of federal and state deferred tax assets and  as a result  a valuation allowance of approximately million has been established at december  recent pronouncements in march  the fasb approved the consensus reached on the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides guidance on determining when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary and the measure of the impairment loss 
eitf also provides new disclosure requirements for other than temporary impairments on debt and equity investments 
in september  the fasb delayed until further notice the effective date of the measurement and recognition guidance contained in eitf  however the disclosure requirements are currently effective 
the adoption of eitf is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in march  the eitf reached a final consensus on eitf issue no 
 participating securities and the two class method under fasb  earnings per share 
eitf no 
addresses a number of questions regarding the computation of earnings per share eps by companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends and earnings of the company when  and if  it declares dividends on its common stock 
the issue also provides further guidance in applying the two class method of calculating eps 
it clarifies what constitutes a participating security and how to apply the two class method of computing eps once it is determined that a security is participating  including how to allocate undistributed earnings to such a security 
the consensuses reached on eitf no 
is effective for fiscal periods beginning after march  the adoption of eitf no 
had no effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb  issued a revision to sfas share based payment  also known as sfas r  that amends existing accounting pronouncements for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee and certain non employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb and generally requires such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
sfas r s effective date would be applicable for awards that are granted  modified  become vested  or settled in cash in interim or annual periods beginning after june  sfas r includes three transition methods one that provides for prospective application and two that provide for retrospective application 
we intend to adopt sfas r prospectively commencing in the third quarter of the fiscal year ending december   it is expected that the adoption of sfas r will cause us to record  as expense each quarter  a non cash accounting charge approximating the fair value of such share based compensation meeting the criteria outlined in the provisions of sfas r  as of december   we have approximately  stock options outstanding which had not yet become vested

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments 
we place our investments in high quality financial instruments  primarily us treasury notes and bills  and obligations of us government agencies  which we believe are subject to limited credit risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments of million  consisting of cash and short term investments 
our short term investments will decline by an immaterial amount if market interest rates increase  and therefore  our exposure to interest rate changes is immaterial 
declines of interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income from our short term investments 
as of december   we had million outstanding under long term obligations 
interest rates on million of these obligations are fixed and therefore are not subject to interest rate fluctuations 
the interest rate on the remaining million under the genzyme promissory note is variable based on the prime interest rate and is therefore subject to interest rate fluctuations 
a increase in the prime rate would result in an additional  in annual interest expense 
most of our transactions are conducted in us dollars 
we have collaboration and technology license agreements with parties located outside of the united states 
we also have a research facility located in europe 
transactions under certain of the agreements between us and parties located outside of the united states  as well as transactions conducted by our foreign facility are conducted in local foreign currencies 
if exchange rates undergo a change of up to  we do not believe that it would have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows
