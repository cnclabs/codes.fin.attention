our operating results during fiscal  and reflect management s focus on profitability  improved cash flow  cost management and earnings growth 
management tracks closely the following criteria to evaluate current business operations and future prospects royalties  franchise fees  growth in leased assets  selling  general and administrative expenses  franchise store openings and closings and franchise renewals 
our most profitable sources of revenue are royalties earned from our franchise partners and franchise fees for new store openings and transfers 
royalties franchise fees during  our royalties increased  or compared to this increase is due to increased franchise store retail sales 
franchise fees grew modestly over the past three years and primarily reflect new openings in all brands 
to date  revenue generated from the company s leasing activities has been immaterial to the company s financial results  but is expected to be material in management monitors several nonfinancial factors in evaluating the current business operations and future prospects including franchise store openings and closings and franchise renewals

our franchisees sign year agreements with us 
the renewal of existing franchise agreements as they approach their expiration is an indicator that management monitors to determine the health of our business and the preservation of future royalties 
in  the company renewed of franchise agreements up for renewal 
this percentage of renewal has ranged between and during the last three years 
the increase in profitability of our franchise business has been accomplished in part due to management s focus on reducing selling  general and administrative expenses 
the major components of selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries  wages and benefits  advertising  travel  rent and administrative costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses our ability to grow our profits is dependent on our ability to i effectively support our franchise partners so that they produce higher revenues  ii open new franchised stores  iii our ability to increase the leasing activity of winmark business solutions and winmark capital corporation and iv controlling our selling  general and administrative expenses

since music go round stores have a higher cost of goods sold than other brands of company owned stores  the mix of sales by brand and related cost of goods sold has improved 
the percentage point increase in the cost of merchandise sold at the company owned stores compared to is primarily due to discounting older inventory items at the company owned retail stores

on september   winmark corporation established a day million line of credit with lasalle bank national association bearing interest at libor  plus  up to million of which may be used to finance leasing operations 
the line of credit will be used for financing growth in the company s leasing business and for general corporate purposes 
the company has not yet drawn any funds from the line of credit 
the lasalle line of credit is secured by a lien against substantially all of the company s assets 
the company believes that cash generated from future operations and cash and investments on hand  will be adequate to meet the company s current obligations including the investments in commercial credit group  inc and bridgefunds limited  and operating needs 
the company believes that the combination of its cash on hand  the cash generated from its franchising business  as well as its bank line of credit  will be adequate to fund its planned operations for critical accounting policies we prepare the consolidated financial statements of winmark corporation and subsidiaries in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies that we believe are most important to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the company collects royalties from each franchise based on a percentage of retail store gross sales 
the company recognizes royalties as revenue when earned 
at the end of each accounting period  estimates of royalty amounts due are made based on historical sales information 
if there are significant changes in the estimates of franchise sales our revenue would be impacted 
the company collects franchise fees when franchise agreements are signed and recognizes the franchise fees as revenue when the store is opened  which is when the company has performed substantially all initial services required by the franchise agreement 
franchise fees collected from franchisees but not yet recognized as income  are recorded as deferred revenue in the liability section of our balance sheet 
merchandise sales through the buying group are recognized when the product has been shipped 
revenue from sales at our company owned stores are recognized at the time of the merchandise sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts we must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts and notes receivables 
we base the adequacy of the allowance on historical bad debts  current economic trends and specific analysis of each franchisee s payment trends and credit worthiness 
if any of the above noted items would be significantly different than estimates  our results could be different 
outlook forward looking statements the statements contained in the letter from the ceo and the president  item business and in this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not strictly historical fact  including without limitation  our statements relating to growth opportunities  prospects for winmark business solutions and winmark capital corporation  contribution of the leasing business to financial results  anticipated operations of our leasing businesses  our ability to open new franchise stores  our ability to manage costs in the future  the number of stores we believe will open and our belief that we will have adequate capital and reserves to meet our current and contingent obligations and operating needs are forward looking statements made under the safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act 
such statements are based on management s current expectations as of the date of this report but involve risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements 
investors are cautioned to consider these forward looking statements in light of important factors which may result in variations from results contemplated by such forward looking statements including  but not limited to the risk factors discussed below 
risk factors dependence on renewals each of our franchise agreements is years long 
at the end of the term of each franchise agreement  each franchisee has the option to renew the franchise relationship by signing a new year franchise agreement 
in  of the franchisees that had their play it again sports franchise agreement expire  signed new year franchise agreements 
in   and   and play it again sports franchise agreements will expire  respectively 
we believe that renewing a significant number of these franchise relationships is extremely important to the success of the company 
if a significant number of such franchise relationships are not renewed  our financial performance may be materially and adversely affected 
in  of the franchisees that had their once upon a child franchise agreement expire  signed new year franchise agreements 
in   and   and once upon a child franchise agreements will expire  respectively 
we believe that renewing a significant number of these franchise relationships is extremely important to the continued success of the company 
if a significant number of such franchise relationships are not renewed  our financial performance may be materially and adversely affected 
in  and    and music go round franchise agreements will expire  respectively 
we believe that renewing a significant number of these franchise relationships is important to the success of the company 
none of our plato s closet franchise agreements will expire in  or decline in number of play it again sports franchises in  play it again sports closed stores and opened stores  a net loss of stores 
in  play it again sports closed stores and opened stores  a net loss of stores 
in  play it again sports closed stores and opened stores  a net loss of stores 
in  play it again sports closed stores and opened stores  a net loss of stores 
in  play it again sports closed stores and opened stores  a net loss of stores 
in  play it again sports closed stores and opened stores  a net loss of stores 
in  play it again sports closed stores and opened stores  a net loss of stores 
it is very important to our future success that the net loss of play it again sports stores be slowed and ultimately reversed 
we believe that a certain number of stores will close each year 
our objective is to minimize store closings by continuing our investment in franchisee support services such as franchisee training  winmark business solutions and the winmark computer support center  by investing capital to improve winmark s proprietary point of sale software system and continuing to train our field operations personnel to better serve franchisee needs 
dependence on new franchisees our ability to generate increased revenue and achieve higher levels of profitability depends in part on increasing the number of franchised stores open 
we believe that many larger and smaller markets will continue to provide significant opportunities for sales of franchises and that we can sustain approximately our current annual level of store openings 
however  there can be no assurance that we will sustain this level of store openings 
inability to collect accounts receivable in the event that our ability to collect accounts receivable significantly declines from current rates  we may incur additional charges that would affect earnings 
unopened stores we believe that a substantial majority of stores sold but not opened will open within the time period permitted by the applicable franchise agreement or we will be able to resell the territories for most of the terminated or expired franchises 
however  there can be no assurance that substantially all of the currently sold but unopened franchises will open and commence paying royalties to us 
at december   we had franchise agreements for stores that are expected to open in dependence on supply of used merchandise our brands are based on offering customers a mix of used and new merchandise 
as a result  obtaining continuing supplies of high quality used merchandise is important to the success of our brands 
supply of used merchandise comes from the general public and is not regular or highly reliable 
there can be no assurance that we will avoid supply problems with respect to used merchandise 
competition retailing  including the sale of sporting goods  children and teenage apparel  and musical instruments  is highly competitive 
many retailers have significantly greater financial and other resources than us and our franchisees 
individual franchisees face competition in their markets from retailers of new merchandise and  in certain instances  resale  thrift and other stores that sell used merchandise 
to date  our franchisees and our company owned stores have not faced a high degree of competition in the sale of used merchandise  but do so in connection with the sale of new merchandise 
however  we may face additional competition as our franchise systems expand and if additional competitors enter the used merchandise market 
our equipment leasing businesses compete with a variety of equipment financing sources that are available to businesses  including national  regional  and local finance companies that provide leases and loan products  financing through captive finance and leasing companies affiliated with major equipment manufacturers  and commercial banks  savings and loans and credit unions 
many of these companies are substantially larger than we are and have considerably greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully compete with these larger competitors 
early stage equipment leasing operations the company began its equipment leasing operations in april of as a result  there can be no assurance that any of the company s planned future activities will be successful 
an inability to successfully launch and operate our equipment leasing business will have a material negative affect on our financial results 
selling  general and administrative expense our ability to control the amount  and rate of growth in  selling  general and administrative expenses and the impact of unusual items resulting from our ongoing evaluation of our business strategies  asset valuations and organizational structures is important to our financial success 
we expect to incur significant additional expense in connection with the launch of winmark business solutions and winmark capital corporation 
in the near term  our revenue expenses may not exceed our expenses 
we cannot assure any investor that we will be able to control such items of expense 
government regulation as a franchisor  we are subject to various federal and state franchise laws and regulations 
although we believe we are currently in material compliance with existing federal and state laws  there is a trend toward increasing government regulation of franchising 
the promulgation of new franchising laws and regulations could adversely affect us 
laws or regulations may be adopted with respect to our equipment leases or the equipment leasing industry  and collection processes 
any new legislation or regulation  or changes in the interpretation of existing laws  which affect the equipment leasing industry could increase our costs of compliance 
minority investments we have invested in four private companies 
the company has purchased million of the common stock of tomsten  inc  a privately held corporation  d b a 
archiver s or of the total outstanding common stock 
archiver s is a retail concept created to help people preserve and enjoy their photographs 
archiver s stores feature a wide variety of photo safe products  including photo albums  scrapbooks and scrapbook supplies  frames  rubber stamps  and photo storage and organization products 
the company has purchased million of membership interests in eframe  llc  a nebraska limited liability company  or of the total outstanding membership interests 
eframe is a privately held company that provides outsourced information technology services 
eframe acts as the information technology department for small and medium size businesses 
eframe has operations throughout the midwest 
as of december   eframe had a net capital deficiency and has had a history of operating losses 
if eframe continues to record operating losses  it will be necessary for them to raise additional debt or equity to finance its operations 
there can be no assurance that eframe will be able to raise capital to fund its operations 
if eframe sustains operating losses and is unable to raise adequate capital  it may cease operations resulting in a loss of our investment 
winmark accounts for its investment under the equity method which means that we recognize our pro rate share of eframe s earnings or losses 
if eframe continues to record operating losses  it will have a material impact on our financial performance 
on october  the company agreed to make a million equity investment in commercial credit group  inc  a newly formed equipment leasing company specializing in construction  transportation and waste management equipment 
we have paid million for approximately of the outstanding equity of commercial credit group 
we will make the remaining  investment within months  and  at such time  we estimate we will own approximately of the outstanding equity of commercial credit group 
on october   we made a commitment to lend million to bridgefunds limited at an annual rate of pursuant to several senior subordinated promissory notes 
each note has a maturity of five years 
bridgefunds limited advances funds to claimants involved in civil litigation to cover litigation expenses 
we have funded million of such million commitment  bridgefunds can draw down on the remaining million dollars when they meet specific business milestones 
in addition  we have received a warrant to purchase of the equity of bridgefunds on a fully diluted basis 
each of our minority investments is either a relatively new or unproven business 
none of the four companies recorded operating profits in any of these businesses may not succeed and ultimately be forced to cease operations 
also  there is not a market for the equity of tomsten  inc  eframe  llc or commercial credit group  inc  and our ability to receive our investment back and realize a cash return on our investment in these companies will depend on i the development of a market for such companies equity or ii the sale of such companies 
bridgefunds may not have the ability to pay interest on amounts owed to us or to repay principal amounts owed to us 
in addition  there is no market for the equity of bridgefunds limited  and  as a result  our warrant to purchase of the stock of bridgefunds limited may be of no value 
we do not have the ability whether by vote  contract or otherwise to control the actions of any of these companies 
the loss of our entire investment in any one or all of our minority investments would have a material negative impact on our financial results 
credit risk in our leasing business  if we inaccurately assess the creditworthiness of our customers  we may experience a higher number of lease defaults than expected  which would reduce our earnings 
for our smaller customers  there is typically only limited publicly available financial and other information about their businesses and they often do not have audited financial statements 
accordingly  in making credit decisions  we rely upon the accuracy of information from the small business owner and or third party sources  such as credit reporting agencies 
if the information we obtain from small business owners and or third party sources is incorrect  our ability to make appropriate credit decisions will be impaired 
if we inaccurately assess the creditworthiness of our customers in our middle market or small ticket businesses  we may experience a higher number of dollar volume of lease defaults than expected and related decreases in our earnings 
if losses from leases exceed our allowance for credit losses  our operating income will be reduced 
in connection with our leases  we record an allowance for credit losses to provide for estimated losses 
determining the appropriate level of the allowance is an inherently uncertain process and therefore our determination of this allowance may prove to be inadequate to cover losses in connection with our portfolio of leases 
losses in excess of our allowance for credit losses would cause us to increase our provision for credit losses  reducing or eliminating our operating income 
we do not undertake and specifically decline any obligations to publicly release the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company incurs financial markets risk in the form of interest rate risk 
management deals with such risk by negotiating fixed rate loan agreements 
accordingly  the company is not exposed to cash flow risks related to interest rate changes 
the company had no debt outstanding at december  approximately  of our investments at december  were invested in fixed income securities and million of cash and cash equivalents in money market mutual funds  which are subject to the effects of market fluctuations in interest rates 
a one percent change in interest rates may have a significant impact on the fair value of the fixed income securities
