it is useful to read management s discussion and analysis in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this document 
our fiscal years end on the saturday closest to january as a result  our fiscal  fiscal and fiscal results consisted of weeks 
all references to earnings per share relate to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 
we include a store in the calculation of comparable store sales once it has been in operation sixty weeks after its initial opening 
if a store is closed during a fiscal period  the store s sales will be included in the computation of comparable store sales for that fiscal month  quarter and year to date period only for the days in which it was operating as compared to those same days in the comparable period 
relocated  remodeled and expanded square footage stores are classified the same as the original store and are not considered new stores upon relocation  remodeling or completion of their expansion 

table of contents overview we are a leading specialty retailer of value priced fashion accessories and jewelry for pre teens and teenagers as well as young adults 
we are organized based on our geographic markets  which include our north american operations and our international operations 
as of january   we operated a total of  stores in all states of the united states  puerto rico  canada  the virgin islands  the united kingdom  switzerland  austria  germany the latter three collectively referred to as sag  france and ireland 
the stores are operated mainly under the trade names claire s boutiques  claire s accessories  icing by claire s  afterthoughts and the icing 
we are in the process of transitioning our afterthoughts stores to icing by claire s stores to capitalize on the claire s brand name 
we also operate stores in japan through a joint venture with aeon co 
ltd 
claire s nippon 
we account for the results of operations of claire s nippon under the equity method and include these results within interest and other income in our statement of operations within our north american division 
in addition  we license stores in the middle east under a licensing and merchandising agreement with al shaya co 
ltd 
and stores in south africa under similar agreements with the house of busby limited 
we account for the goods we sell under the merchandising agreements within gross profit in our north american division and the license fees we charge within interest and other income within our international division in our statement of operations 
we have two store concepts claire s accessories  which caters to fashion conscious girls and teens in the to age range  and icing by claire s  which caters to fashion conscious teens and young women in the to age range 
our merchandise typically ranges in price between and  with the average product sold at approximately our stores share a similar format and our different store concepts and trade names allow us to have multiple store locations in a single mall 
although we face competition from a number of small specialty store chains and others selling fashion accessories  we believe that our stores comprise one of the largest chains of specialty retail stores in the world devoted to the sale of value priced fashion accessories for pre teen  teenage and young adult females 
fundamentally  our business model is to offer the customer a compelling price value relationship and a wide array of products to choose from 
we seek to deliver a high level of profitability and cash flow by maximizing the effectiveness of our retail product pricing through promotional activity minimizing our product costs through economies of scale as the world s leading mall based retailer of value priced accessories and jewelry reinvesting operating cash flows into opening new stores  remodeling existing stores and infrastructure in order to create future revenues and build brand name loyalty while our financial results have grown steadily and record sales performance was achieved during fiscal  the retail environment remains very competitive 
management s plan for future growth is dependent on our ability to successfully identify merchandise appealing to our customers displaying our merchandise at convenient  accessible locations staffed with personnel that provide courteous and professional customer service sourcing our merchandise to achieve a positive price value relationship increasing sales at existing store locations expanding our sales  with our focus on our international segment  through additional store locations 
table of contents our ability to achieve these objectives will be dependent on various factors  including those outlined in cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to estimate the effect of various matters that are inherently uncertain as of the date of the financial statements 
each of these required estimates varies in regard to the level of judgment involved and its potential impact on our reported financial results 
estimates are deemed critical when a different estimate could have reasonably been used or where changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  and would materially impact our financial condition  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  critical estimates inherent in these accounting policies are discussed in the following paragraphs 
inventory valuation our inventories in north america and sag are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the retail method 
inherent in the retail inventory calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markups  markdowns and shrinkage  which impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as resulting gross margins 
the methodologies used to value merchandise inventories include the development of the cost to retail ratios  the groupings of homogeneous classes of merchandise  development of shrinkage reserves and the accounting for retail price changes 
the inventories in our united kingdom  irish and french stores are accounted for under the lower of cost or market method  with cost determined using the average cost method 
inventory valuation is impacted by the estimation of slow moving goods  shrinkage and markdowns 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred 
a potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows at the district level are less than the carrying value of the assets 
the estimate of cash flows includes management s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of the asset in operations 
when a potential impairment has occurred  an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
fair value is measured based on a projected discounted cash flow model using a discount rate we feel is commensurate with the risk inherent in our business 
our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives of assets 
actual results may differ  which could materially impact our impairment assessment 
during fiscal  we recorded impairment charges of million relating to fixed assets in our international segment due to those assets not being recoverable by estimated discounted cash flows 
we recorded no impairment charges during fiscal and fiscal goodwill impairment we continually evaluate whether events and changes in circumstances warrant recognition of an impairment loss of goodwill 
the conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment of goodwill include a significant  sustained negative trend in our operating results or cash flows  a decrease in demand for our products  a change in the competitive environment and other industry and economic factors 
we measure impairment of goodwill utilizing the discounted cash flow method for each of our reporting units 
the estimated discounted cash flows are then compared to our goodwill amounts 
if the balance of the goodwill exceeds the estimated discounted cash flows  the excess of the balance is written off 
future cash flows may not meet projected amounts  which could result in impairment 
we performed these analyses during fiscal and and no impairment was required 

table of contents intangible asset impairment we continually evaluate whether events and changes in circumstances warrant revised estimates of the useful lives or recognition of an impairment loss for intangible assets 
future adverse changes in market and legal conditions  or poor operating results of underlying assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the intangible asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the company has concluded that certain intangible assets  comprised primarily of lease rights  qualify as indefinite life intangible assets 
fair market value of the lease rights was determined through the use of third party valuation 
in addition  we make investments through our international subsidiaries in intangible assets upon the opening and acquisition of many of our store locations in europe 
these other intangible assets  which are subject to amortization  are amortized over the useful lives of the respective leases  not to exceed years 
we evaluate the market value of these assets periodically and record the impairment charge when we believe the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable 
we recorded impairment charges of approximately million in fiscal because the market value of certain lease rights included in our international segment were determined to be less than their carrying values 
we recorded no impairment during fiscal and fiscal income taxes we are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions  including the us  individual states and localities and abroad 
we must first determine which revenues and expenses are included for each taxing jurisdiction 
this process also involves the estimation of our actual current tax exposure  together with the assessment of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of income or expense items for tax and accounting purposes 
we establish deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of these temporary differences 
if we adjust our estimates in the future such that we would not expect to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets  we may need to establish  or adjust a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  which could also materially affect our effective tax rate 
we establish tax reserves in our consolidated financial statements based on our estimation of current tax exposures 
if we prevail in tax matters for which reserves have been established or we are required to settle matters in excess of established reserves  our effective tax rate for a particular period could be materially affected 
income tax expense also reflects our best estimate and assumptions regarding  among other things  the level of future taxable income  interpretation of tax laws of multiple jurisdictions  and tax planning 
future changes in tax laws  changes in projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could affect the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us 
during the year  we base our tax rate on an estimate of our expected annual effective tax rate 
these estimates are updated quarterly 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
although management believes that the estimates discussed above are reasonable and the related calculations conform to generally accepted accounting principles  actual results could differ from these estimates  and such differences could be material 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them 

table of contents results of consolidated operations overall  our operating results for fiscal were a record in terms of sales and profitability 
a summary of our consolidated results of operations is as follows dollars in thousands  except per share data fiscal year net sales comparable store sales gross profit percentage selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales income from continuing operations net income income from continuing operations per diluted share number of stores at the end of the period number of stores excludes claire s nippon during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an after tax charge of approximately million  or 
per diluted share  relative to a settlement of litigation in connection with our disposition of our apparel segment in fiscal this amount has been accounted for as loss from discontinued operation within our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income 
net sales in fiscal increased by million  or  from fiscal  which in turn was million  or higher than fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to comparable store sales increases of and  or approximately million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  the effects of the weak us dollar when translating our foreign operations at higher exchange rates of approximately million and million  respectively  and new stores opened in our international division which produced higher average store sales than the stores we closed in our north american division 
the positive comparable sales experienced in our north american division during fiscal and fiscal were across most merchandise categories  most notably in the jewelry related areas and were primarily driven by an increase in the average number of transactions per store 
we believe we experienced this trend through successfully meeting our customers demand for current fashion trends in jewelry and superior customer service in our stores 
we have actively employed strategic initiatives in our international division to address the negative comparable store sales trend noted in the second half of fiscal these initiatives included sharing best practices employed in our north american division for merchandise selection  store operations and attentive customer service 
we believe our efforts contributed to our international division s success in fiscal  providing comparable store sales of 
the following table compares our sales of each product category for the last three fiscal years fiscal year ended jan

table of contents in calculating gross profit and gross profit percentages  we exclude the costs related to our distribution center 
these costs are included instead in selling  general and administrative expenses 
other retail companies may include these costs in cost of sales  so our gross profit percentages may not be comparable to those retailers 
gross profit percentages increased by basis points and basis points during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the primary source of this improvement during fiscal was the ability of our international division to source a significant portion of goods at a lower cost due to those goods being purchased from our vendors in us dollars 
the lower cost was available due to the weakness in the us dollar as compared to the british pound and the euro and approximated million 
most of the goods sourced for sale in our international division are purchased in us dollars 
in addition  comparable sales increased at a rate faster than the increase in our occupancy related costs  creating positive leverage on those costs  however  these costs were partially offset by higher markdowns recorded at the end of fiscal in connection with the christmas selling season not meeting expectations 
fiscal also includes million of rent expense recorded to account for the cumulative impact of not recording rent expense during the construction period prior to lease commencement 
the increased gross profit percentages during fiscal were primarily the result of improved merchandise margins relating to the shift in business from accessories to jewelry  as jewelry carries a higher initial markup and profit margin than that of accessories 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these increases are primarily attributable to the increases in compensation paid to store personnel due to average wage increases and additional hours worked in our north american stores and the effects of the weak us dollar when translating our foreign operations at higher exchange rates 
additional hours worked in the north american stores were necessary to achieve the positive comparable store sales experienced during these periods 
in addition  during fiscal and fiscal  increased store  field and corporate bonuses were earned in north america due to the positive comparable store sales and profit results during the period 
we also recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the retirement compensation package of our founder and former chairman of the board 
as a percentage of net sales  however  selling  general and administrative expenses improved by basis points and basis points during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
this improvement was primarily due to comparable store increases greater than the overall increases in the underlying expenses 
our effective income tax rate for fiscal and fiscal was 
during fiscal  we recorded net benefits to the provision for income taxes totaling approximately 
million attributable to concluded state tax examinations that were settled more favorably than anticipated 
included in income taxes for fiscal was a tax benefit of approximately million related to concluded united states and foreign tax examinations that were settled more favorably than anticipated 
excluding the million benefit recorded for fiscal  our effective income tax rate for fiscal has decreased from the previous year due to a greater proportion of earnings from our international operations 
this is primarily due to the fact that our combined effective income tax rate for international operations is generally lower than our effective income tax rate for domestic operations 
our effective income tax rate in future periods will depend on several variables  including the mix of earnings between domestic and international operations and our overall level of earnings 
our effective income tax rate could also be affected by the resolution of tax contingencies for amounts different from our current estimates 
income from continuing operations increased by approximately million and million during each of fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these increases were made possible primarily by the increase in comparable store sales and improved merchandise margins achieved during the period  as well as the leverage attained on our fixed costs 

table of contents seasonality and quarterly results our business is seasonal by nature  with the christmas  easter and back to school periods historically accounting for the largest percentage of annual net sales 
in fiscal  the christmas  easter and back to school periods together accounted for approximately of our annual net sales 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for our quarterly results of operations 
impact of inflation inflation impacts several of our operating costs including  but not limited to cost of goods and supplies  occupancy costs and labor expenses 
we seek to mitigate these effects by passing along inflationary increases in costs through increased sales prices of our products or by increasing sales volumes 
matters affecting comparability included within interest and other income during fiscal and fiscal is approximately million and million  respectively  of income recognized on our investment in claire s nippon 
we recorded no income during fiscal as our portion of losses incurred by claire s nippon were in excess of our investment and advances 
under the equity method of accounting  those losses would not be reflected in our financial statements once our investment and advances were reduced to zero 
store counts for the three years included in the tables above and below exclude claire s nippon stores 
we believe that an understanding of our reported results and our ongoing financial performance is not complete without considering this impact and other transactions  as described within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
segment operations we are organized into two business segments north america and international 
following is a discussion of results of operations by business segment 
north america key statistics and results of operations for our north american division are as follows dollars in thousands fiscal year net sales comparable store sales gross profit percentage number of stores at the end of the period number of stores excludes claire s nippon it is our objective to increase sales in north america primarily through generating comparable store sales increases and also by increasing our quantity of our selling square footage 
net sales in north america during fiscal increased by million  or  from fiscal  which in turn was million  or higher than fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to comparable store sales increases of and or approximately and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and were primarily driven by an increase in the number of transactions per store 

table of contents the positive comparable sales experienced in north america were across most merchandise categories  most notably in the jewelry related areas 
we believe we experienced this trend through successfully meeting our customers demand for current fashion trends in jewelry and superior customer service in our stores 
in addition  best practices in merchandise buying  planning and allocation from claire s have been shared with the icing by claire s and afterthoughts stores  which we believe have contributed significantly to the comparable store sales increases experienced during fiscal the following table compares our sales of each product category for the last three fiscal years fiscal year ended jan

 jewelry accessories the higher concentration of sales in jewelry as compared to accessories experienced during fiscal and has had the result of improved gross profit margins due to the higher initial markup realized on jewelry 
international division key statistics and results of operations for our international division are as follows dollars in thousands fiscal year net sales comparable store sales gross profit percentage number of stores at the end of the period number of stores excludes claire s nippon it is our objective to increase sales in the international division primarily through store growth and also through comparable store sales increases 
we also continue to explore adding operations in countries in which we do not currently operate 
net sales in our international division during fiscal increased by million  or  from fiscal  which in turn was million  or higher than fiscal the increase in net sales during fiscal was primarily attributable to the net addition of stores  the effects of the weak us dollar when translating our foreign operations at higher exchange rates of approximately million and by comparable store sales increases of  or approximately million during the period 
the comparable store sales increase in fiscal was primarily driven by an average increase in the number of units sold in each transaction 
the increase in net sales during fiscal was primarily attributable to the net addition of stores  the effects of the weak us dollar when translating our foreign operations at higher exchange rates of approximately million  offset by comparable store sales decreases of  or approximately million during the period 
we believe that the deterioration of comparable store sales during fiscal was caused both by the difficult economic environments in several european countries for which we have store locations and also the deviation from best practices learned and practiced in our north american operations 

table of contents the following table compares our sales of each product category for the last three fiscal years fiscal year ended jan

 jewelry accessories gross profit percentages improved by basis points in fiscal and by basis points in fiscal the primary source of this improvement during both fiscal years was the ability of our international division to source a significant portion of goods at a lower cost due to those goods being purchased from our vendors in us dollars  or approximately million and million  respectively 
the lower cost was available due to the weakness in the us dollar as compared to the british pound and the euro 
most of the goods sourced for sale in our international division are purchased in us dollars 
analysis of consolidated financial condition a summary of cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities is outlined in the table below dollars in thousands fiscal year ended january  january  february  operating activities investing activities financing activities we have consistently satisfied operating liquidity needs and planned capital expenditure programs through our normal conversion of sales to cash 
over the three years ended in fiscal  we generated over million of cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations 
we ended the year with approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments  an overall increase of million from the prior year 
we ended the year with no debt outstanding 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was due to cash generated from operations and purchases  net of sales  of short term investments  offset by capital expenditures and the payment of dividends 
our major source of cash from operations is store sales  nearly all of which are generated on a cash or credit card basis 
our primary outflow of cash from operations is the purchase of short term investments and inventory net of customary credit arrangements with vendors  operational costs and the payment of current taxes 
working capital at the end of fiscal was million compared to million at the end of fiscal changes in working capital reflect higher inventory levels and prepaid expenses  offset by higher accounts payable  which is due to the timing of inventory payments and increased accrued expenses  which reflects the increased bonuses earned by store  field and corporate employees that were not yet paid at the end of the year 

table of contents our million of capital expenditures in fiscal were made primarily to remodel existing stores and to open new stores 
we generally experience a noticeable increase in sales in locations where a store has been recently remodeled 
we also invested approximately million during fiscal in intangible assets within our international division which generally represents acquired lease rights on new store locations in certain countries 
we expect to fund between million and million of capital expenditures and million to million of purchased lease rights in fiscal in an effort to continue to remodel and expand our store base 
in addition  purchases  net of sales of short term investments  amounted to million during fiscal we also paid dividends of million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million from the prior year 
dividends were increased again at the end of fiscal  and as of march   we expect to pay at least million in dividends in fiscal liquidity and capital resources we entered into a new credit facility in march this credit facility is a revolving line of credit of up to million  is secured by inventory in the united states and is due to expire march  the borrowings under this facility are limited based on certain calculations of availability  based primarily on the amount of inventory on hand in the united states 
at january   the entire amount of million would have been available for borrowing by us  subject to reduction for million of outstanding letters of credit 
the credit facility is cancelable by us without penalty and bears interest at an initial margin of basis points over the london interbank borrowing rate libor 
the margin is then adjusted periodically based on certain liquidity measurements 
the credit facility also contains other restrictive covenants which limit  among other things  our ability to make dividend distributions 
this credit facility replaced our prior credit facility  which included a million revolving line of credit and a million five year term loan 
our non us subsidiaries have available credit facilities totaling approximately  with banks 
the facilities are used for working capital requirements  letters of credit and various guarantees 
these credit facilities have been arranged in accordance with customary lending practices in their respective countries of operation 
at january   there were no borrowings under these credit facilities 
management believes that our present ability to borrow is greater than our established credit lines 
however  if market conditions change and sales were to dramatically decline or we could not control operating costs or other expenses  our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced  and we could experience an increase in borrowing costs  or even a reduction in or elimination of our access to debt and or equity markets 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements we finance certain leasehold improvements and equipment used in our stores through transactions accounted for as non cancelable operating leases 
as a result  the rental expense for these leasehold improvements and equipment is recorded during the term of the lease contract in our consolidated financial statements  generally over four to seven years 
in the event that any of the real property leases where leasehold improvements or equipment are located that are subject to these non cancelable operating leases are terminated by us or our landlord prior to the scheduled expiration date of the real property lease  we will be required to accrue all future rent payments under these operating leases 

table of contents as of january   our future financial commitments under our arrangements were as follows payments due by period contractual obligations less than more than in millions total year years years years operating leases for real estate operating leases for equipment and leasehold improvements letters of credit total in fiscal  we disposed of our apparel segment  which was comprised of mr 
rags stores  or lux corp 
as of january   we remained guarantor on certain real estate leases for mr 
rags store locations with future rental payments of approximately million 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board  fasb issued interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities 
the interpretation requires certain variable interest entities  as defined  to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin  as amended  is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after december  in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin fin r to clarify some of the provisions of the interpretation and defer the implementation date for certain entities to periods ending after march  the adoption of fin r did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas r  share based payment  a revision of sfas the standard requires companies to expense the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees and is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june  in accordance with the revised statement  we will be required to recognize the expense attributable to stock options granted or vested subsequent to july  we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  and we have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency we are exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the us dollar value of foreign currency denominated transactions and our investment in foreign subsidiaries 
we manage this exposure to market risk through our regular operating and financing activities  and foreign currency options 
exposure to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to foreign operations buying  selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
we may manage our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying  selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by using foreign currency options from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure 
at january   we had not entered into foreign currency options 
we do not generally hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries  since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries 
during fiscal  included in comprehensive income and stockholders equity is million reflecting foreign currency translation 
based on our average net currency positions in fiscal  the potential gain or loss due to a adverse change on foreign currency exchange rates could be significant to our operations 

table of contents certain of our subsidiaries make significant us dollar purchases from asian suppliers  particularly in china 
there continues to be speculation that china may elect to adjust the exchange rate of the chinese yuan against the us dollar 
currently  the chinese yuan has a fixed exchange rate against the us dollar 
if china adjusts the exchange rate or allows the value to float  based on the current weak us dollar  we could experience increases in our cost of merchandise imported from china 
the results of operations of foreign subsidiaries  when translated into us dollars  reflect the average rates of exchange for the periods presented 
as a result  similar results in local currency can vary significantly upon translation into us dollars if exchange rates fluctuate significantly from one period to the next 
interest rates our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates is limited to our cash  cash equivalents and debt 
based on our average invested cash balances and outstanding debt during fiscal  a increase in the average effective interest rate in fiscal would not have materially impacted our annual interest income or expense
