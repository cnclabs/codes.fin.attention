item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reference is made throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to notes included in the consolidated financial statements  beginning on page f of this report 
overview industry background our continuing operations are comprised of one operating segment pulp and papermaking systems papermaking systems  and a separate product line  fiber based products 
through our pulp and papermaking systems segment  we develop  manufacture  and market a range of equipment and products for the domestic and international papermaking and paper recycling industries 
we have a large  stable customer base that includes most of the world s major paper manufacturers 
as a result  we have one of the largest installed bases of equipment in the pulp and paper industry 
our installed base provides us with a spare parts and consumables business that yields higher margins than our capital equipment business  and which  we believe  is less susceptible to the cyclical trends in the paper industry 
through our fiber based products line  we manufacture and sell granules derived from pulp fiber for use as carriers for agricultural  home lawn and garden  and professional lawn  turf and ornamental applications  as well as for oil and grease absorption 
we also offer composite decking products  which include decking and railing systems and roof tiles  produced from recycled fiber  plastic  and other material  and are marketed through distributors primarily to the building industry 
these products are part of our composite building products business composites business  which has been presented as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  as we intend to sell this business 
we are currently operating the composites business as a going concern and are working with an investment banking group to sell this business 
all prior period financial information has been restated to reflect the composites business as a discontinued operation 
international sales during  approximately of our sales were to customers outside the united states  principally in europe and asia 
we generally seek to charge our customers in the same currency in which our operating costs are incurred 
however  our financial performance and competitive position can be affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations affecting the relationship between the us dollar and foreign currencies 
we seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations through the use of forward currency exchange contracts 
we may enter into forward contracts to hedge certain firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
these contracts hedge transactions principally denominated in us dollars 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that entail significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments  are those described below 
for a discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents kadant inc annual report revenue recognition 
we enter into arrangements with customers that have multiple deliverables  such as equipment and installation  and we recognize revenues and profits on certain long term contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
percentage of completion 
revenues recorded under the percentage of completion method of accounting were million in  million in  and million in the percentage of completion is determined by comparing the actual costs incurred to date to an estimate of total costs to be incurred on each contract 
if a loss is indicated on any contract in process  a provision is made currently for the entire loss 
our contracts generally provide for billing of customers upon the attainment of certain milestones specified in each contract 
revenues earned on contracts in process in excess of billings are classified as unbilled contract costs and fees  and amounts billed in excess of revenues are classified as billings in excess of contract costs and fees 
the complexity of the estimation process under the percentage of completion method affects the amounts reported in our financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors affect our percentage of completion and cost of sales estimates  including labor rate and efficiency variances  estimates of warranty costs  estimated future material prices from vendors  and customer specification and testing requirements 
in addition  we are exposed to the risk  primarily relating to our orders in china  that a customer will not comply with the order s contractual obligations to take delivery of the equipment 
this risk is mitigated by such customer s forfeiture of their deposit on the order 
the contractual obligations relating to the order may be difficult to enforce through a foreign country s legal system  which could result in a significant credit exposure in the period or periods that were to be affected by the breach of contract 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our estimates in the application of this accounting policy  if our business conditions were to be different  or if we were to use different assumptions  it is possible that materially different amounts could be reported as revenues in our financial statements 
sab no 
under staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  when the terms of sale include customer acceptance provisions  and compliance with those provisions cannot be demonstrated until customer acceptance  revenues are recognized upon such acceptance 
when a sale arrangement involves multiple elements eg  installation  we consider the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
such transactions are evaluated to determine whether the deliverables in the arrangement represent separate units of accounting 
if equipment and installation do not meet the separation criteria under eitf no 
 revenues for products sold that require installation  for which the installation is essential to functionality or is not deemed inconsequential or perfunctory  are recognized upon completion of installation 
revenues for products sold where installation is not essential to functionality  and is deemed inconsequential or perfunctory  are recognized upon shipment  with estimated installation costs accrued 
we provide a reserve for the estimated warranty and installation costs at the time revenue is recognized  as applicable 
to the extent that installation becomes a significant component of our business in the future  the judgment associated with the determination of revenue recognition will increase 
the complexity of all issues related to the assumptions  risks  and uncertainties inherent in the application of sab no 
affects the amounts reported as revenues in our financial statements 
under sab no 
 we may not be able to reliably predict future revenues and profitability due to the difficulty of estimating when installation will be performed or when we will meet the contractually agreed upon performance tests  which can delay or prohibit recognition of revenues 
the determination of when we install the equipment or fulfill the performance guarantees is largely dependent on our customers  their willingness to allow installation of the equipment or performance of the appropriate tests in a timely manner  and their cooperation in addressing possible problems that would impede achievement of the performance guarantee criteria 
unexpected changes in the timing related to the completion of installation or performance guarantees could cause our revenues and earnings to be significantly affected 

table of contents kadant inc annual report inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost on a first in  first out  or weighted average basis or market value and include materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare these amounts to historical and forecasted usage of and demand for each particular product or product line 
we record a charge to cost of revenues for excess and obsolete inventory to reduce the carrying value of the inventories to net realizable value 
inventory writedowns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand  resulting in a charge for the writedown of that inventory in that period 
in addition  our estimates of future product usage or demand may prove to be inaccurate  resulting in an understated or overstated provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product usage and demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets annually in the fourth quarter  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances  such as a decline in sales  earnings  or cash flows  or material adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired 
we completed our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of using estimates from our long range forecasts 
no adjustment was required to the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets based on the analysis performed 
goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
fair values are primarily established using a discounted cash flow methodology specifically  the income approach 
the determination of discounted cash flows is based on our long range forecasts 
the revenue growth rates included in the forecasts are our best estimates based on current and anticipated market conditions  and the profit margin assumptions are projected based on current and anticipated cost structures 
our judgments and assumptions regarding the determination of the fair value of an intangible asset or goodwill associated with an acquired business could change as future events impact such fair values 
any future impairment loss could have a material adverse affect on our long term assets and operating expenses in the period in which impairment is determined to exist 
accounts receivable 
we exercise judgment in determining our allowance for bad debts  which is based on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policies  specific customer collection issues  and accounts receivable aging categories 
in determining this allowance  we look at historical writeoffs of our receivables 
we also look at current trends in the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in our credit policies 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and each customer s current creditworthiness 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
in addition  in some instances we utilize letters of credit as a way to mitigate credit exposure 
while actual bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same rate of bad debts that we have in the past  especially in light of business conditions in the paper industry 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of our customers could result in the uncollectibility of the related accounts receivable and could adversely affect our operating cash flows in that period 
warranties 
in the papermaking systems segment  we offer warranties of various durations to our customers depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement 
we typically negotiate terms regarding warranty coverage and length of warranty depending on the products and their application 
our standard mechanical warranties require us to repair or replace a defective product during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
we record an estimate for warranty related costs at the time of sale based on our actual historical return rates and repair costs  as well as other analytical tools for estimating future warranty claims 
these estimates are revised for variances between actual and expected claims rates 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that we have in the past 

table of contents kadant inc annual report in our composites business  presented as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we offer a standard limited warranty to the original owner of our decking and roofing products  limited to repair or replacement of the defective product or a refund of the original purchase price 
we record an estimate for warranty related costs at the time of sale based on our actual historical return rates and repair costs  as well as other analytical tools for estimating future warranty claims 
these estimates are revised for variances between actual and expected claims rates 
our analysis of expected warranty claims rates includes detailed assumptions associated with potential product returns  including the type of product sold  temperatures at the location of installation  density of boards  and other factors 
certain assumptions  such as the effect of weather conditions and high temperatures on the product installed  include inherent uncertainties that are subject to fluctuation which could impact our future warranty provisions 
due to the highly subjective nature of these assumptions  we have recorded our best estimate of the cost of expected warranty claims 
it is reasonably possible that the ultimate settlement of such claims may exceed the amount recorded 
we experienced an increase in warranty claims in the latter half of compared to prior periods related to contraction of our decking products and a new problem beginning in the third quarter of concerning excessive oxidation that affected the integrity of the plastic used in some of our decking products manufactured prior to october although we increased the warranty provision in accordingly  the reserves established may not be sufficient if we incur warranty return rates higher than we anticipated 
a significant increase in warranty return rates or costs to repair our products would lead to an increase in the warranty provision and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results for the period or periods in which such returns or additional costs occur 
industry and business outlook our products are primarily sold to the pulp and paper industry 
although the paper industry had been in a prolonged downcycle for the past several years  the performance of paper producers  especially in north america  has been gradually improving over the past few quarters 
increased operating rates and improved pricing has helped to increase the profitability of paper producers during this period 
nevertheless  we believe paper companies are still cautious about increasing their capital and operating spending in the current market environment 
we expect  however  that as the market recovers  paper companies will increase their capital and operating spending  which will have a positive effect on paper company suppliers  such as kadant  although the timing of such effect is difficult to predict 
we continue to concentrate our efforts on several initiatives intended to improve our operating results  including i expanding our business in china  ii increasing our higher margin parts and consumables businesses across all our product lines  iii sourcing the manufacture of non proprietary components from third party suppliers  iv shifting more production to our lower cost manufacturing facilities  and v lowering our manufacturing overhead costs throughout the business 
in addition  we continue to focus our efforts on managing our operating costs  capital expenditures  and working capital 
in an effort to improve operating performance at our kadant lamort subsidiary in france  we approved a proposed restructuring of that subsidiary on november  this restructuring is intended to strengthen kadant lamort s competitive position in the european paper industry 
under french law  the proposed restructuring requires consultation with kadant lamort s workers council  which represents the employees  before implementation 
the restructuring primarily includes the reduction of full time positions in france  and is expected to be implemented in we accrued a restructuring charge for severance and other termination costs in connection with the workforce reduction of million in the fourth quarter of negotiations with the workers council are ongoing and kadant lamort has experienced intermittent work stoppages by employees protesting the proposed restructuring 
kadant lamort has developed contingency plans to reduce the risk of the work stoppages affecting its ability to meet its contractual commitments 
we expect that kadant lamort will continue to experience operating losses until these restructuring actions are completed 
we continue to pursue market opportunities outside north america 
in the last several years  china has become a significant market for our stock preparation equipment 
to capitalize on this growing market  we plan 
table of contents kadant inc annual report to build a manufacturing and assembly facility in china for this equipment and related aftermarket products  as well as for our accessories and water management products in the future 
revenues from china are primarily derived from large capital orders  the timing of which is often difficult to predict 
recently  our customers in china have experienced delays in obtaining financing for their capital addition and expansion projects due to efforts by the chinese government to control economic growth  which are reflected in a slowdown in financing approvals in china s banking system 
this has caused delays in receiving orders and  as a result  will delay our recognizing revenue on these projects to periods later than originally expected 
we plan to use our new facility in china as a base for increasing our aftermarket business  which we believe will be more predictable 
our guidance reflects expected revenues and earnings per share for continuing operations  which excludes the results from our composite building products business  which is accounted for as a discontinued operation 
for the first quarter of  we expect to earn  for continuing operations  between

we plan to sell the composites business in at a price that is reasonable compared to its carrying value 
the composites business has been reflected as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented

table of contents kadant inc annual report in may  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our equity securities in the open market or in negotiated transactions through may  as of january   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock under this authorization for million 
under a previous authorization  we repurchased an additional  shares of our common stock for million in the second quarter of on october   the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law 
the act creates a temporary incentive for us multinationals to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the us at an effective tax rate of 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fas 
fas allows companies additional time to evaluate the effect of the law on whether unrepatriated foreign earnings continue to qualify for the exception in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  to recognizing deferred tax liabilities and would require explanatory disclosures from those who need the additional time 
through january   we have not provided us income taxes on approximately million of unremitted foreign earnings because such earnings were intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us whether we will ultimately utilize and benefit from the provisions of the act depends on a number of factors  including the results of reviewing future congressional guidance before a decision can be made 
until that time  we will make no change in our current intention to indefinitely reinvest accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  except in instances in which we can remit such earnings without a significant associated tax cost 
we do not expect that this will have a material adverse effect on our current liquidity 
absent the repatriation incentive of the act  we believe that any us tax liability due upon remittance of such earnings would be immaterial due to the availability of us foreign tax credits generated from such remittance 
the related foreign tax withholding  which would be required if we remitted the foreign earnings to the us  would be approximately million 
although we currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures  we plan to make expenditures during for property  plant  and equipment of approximately million  including million for a manufacturing and assembly facility in china to support our stock preparation equipment business 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following table summarizes the company s known contractual obligations and commercial commitments to make future payments or other consideration pursuant to certain contracts as of january   as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied

b in the ordinary course of business  we are required to issue limited performance guarantees  which do not require letters of credit  relating to our equipment and systems 
we typically limit our liability under these guarantees to amounts that would not exceed the value of the contract 
we believe that we have adequate 
table of contents kadant inc annual report reserves for any potential liability in connection with such guarantees 
these guarantees are not included in this table 
c this table excludes million of accrued restructuring costs and million of other long term liabilities related primarily to pension plans  as these liabilities are not subject to fixed payment terms 
we expect that the accrued restructuring costs will be paid in provisions in financial guarantees or commitments  debt or lease agreements  or other arrangements could trigger a requirement for an early payment  additional collateral support  amended terms  or acceleration of maturity 
we do not have special purpose entities nor do we use off balance sheet financing arrangements 
in the future  our liquidity position will be primarily affected by the level of cash flows from operations and the amount of cash expended on capital expenditures  or on acquisitions  if any 
we believe that our existing resources  together with the cash we expect to generate from continuing operations  are sufficient to meet the capital requirements of our current operations for the foreseeable future 
risk factors in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  we wish to caution readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  our actual results and could cause our actual results in and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us  or on our behalf 
our business is dependent on the condition of the pulp and paper industry 
we sell products primarily to the pulp and paper industry  which is a cyclical industry 
generally  the financial condition of the global pulp and paper industry corresponds to the condition of the general economy  as well as to a number of other factors  including pulp and paper production capacity relative to demand 
in recent years  the industry in certain geographic regions  notably north america  has been in a prolonged downcycle  resulting in depressed pulp and paper prices  decreased spending  mill closures  consolidations  and bankruptcies  all of which have adversely affected our business 
as paper companies consolidate in response to market weakness  they frequently reduce capacity and postpone or even cancel capacity addition or expansion projects 
these cyclical downturns can cause our sales to decline and adversely affect our profitability 
our business is subject to economic  currency  political  and other risks associated with international sales and operations 
during  approximately of our sales were to customers outside the united states  principally in europe and asia 
international revenues are subject to a number of risks  including the following agreements may be difficult to enforce and receivables difficult to collect through a foreign country s legal system  foreign customers may have longer payment cycles  foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income  impose tariffs  or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade  and the protection of intellectual property in foreign countries may be more difficult to enforce 
although we seek to charge our customers in the same currency in which our operating costs are incurred  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect product demand and adversely affect the profitability in us dollars of products we provide in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in their local currencies 
any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

table of contents kadant inc annual report a significant portion of our international sales has  and may in the future  come from china 
an increase in revenues  as well as our planned operation of a manufacturing and assembly facility in china  will expose us to increased risk in the event of changes in the policies of the chinese government  political unrest  unstable economic conditions  or other developments in china or in us china relations that are adverse to trade  including enactment of protectionist legislation or trade restrictions 
orders from customers in china  particularly for large systems that have been tailored to a customer s specific requirements  involve increased credit risk due to payment terms that are applicable to doing business in china 
in addition  the timing of these orders is often difficult to predict 
we are subject to intense competition in all our markets 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products include quality  price  service  technical expertise  and product innovation 
our competitors include a number of large multinational corporations that may have substantially greater financial  marketing  and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their services and products 
competitors technologies may prove to be superior to ours 
our current products  those under development  and our ability to develop new technologies may not be sufficient to enable us to compete effectively 
competition  especially in china  could increase if new companies enter the market or if existing competitors expand their product lines or intensify efforts within existing product lines 
our inability to successfully identify and complete acquisitions or successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services 
promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons  including competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory  including antitrust  approvals 
we do incur costs from time to time associated with potential acquisitions  which are deferred during the due diligence phase 
future operating results could be negatively impacted in any quarter in which we determine that a potential acquisition will not close and these associated costs are expensed 
any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company 
we may not be able to complete future acquisitions  integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses  make such businesses profitable  or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies  if any  from these acquisitions 
in addition  we have previously acquired several companies and businesses 
as a result of these acquisitions  we have recorded significant goodwill on our balance sheet  and in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in  we recorded a transitional impairment charge upon the adoption of this standard 
any future impairment losses identified will be recorded as reductions to operating income  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our ability to realize the value of the goodwill that we have recorded will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses 
these cash flows depend  in part  on how well we have integrated these businesses 
our inability to successfully complete the proposed restructuring of our kadant lamort subsidiary would have a negative effect on our future operating results 
in an effort to improve operating performance at our kadant lamort subsidiary in france  we approved a proposed restructuring of that subsidiary on november  this restructuring is intended to strengthen kadant lamort s competitive position in the european paper industry 
under french law  the proposed restructuring requires consultation with kadant lamort s workers council  which represents the employees  before implementation 
the restructuring primarily includes the reduction of full time positions in france  and is expected to be implemented in negotiations with the workers council are ongoing and kadant lamort has experienced intermittent work stoppages by employees protesting the proposed restructuring 
we 
table of contents kadant inc annual report expect that this subsidiary will continue to experience operating losses until these restructuring actions are completed 
if we are unable to complete this restructuring  our future operating results would be negatively impacted 
we may not be successful in selling our composite building products business 
on october   our board of directors approved a plan to sell our composite building products business the composites business 
we cannot predict on what terms we may sell the business or if we will be successful in selling this business at all 
there are certain liabilities associated with our composites business  such as warranty obligations  which we will likely not be able to transfer to a future buyer 
if we are not able to transfer these liabilities with the sale  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
under applicable accounting rules  the results of the composites business will be reported as a discontinued operation  however  we will continue to report these results in our consolidated financial statements 
for as long as we continue to own the composite building products business  our consolidated performance will continue to be subject to the risks and uncertainties related to that business  which are identified in the following risk factors 
our performance in the market for composite building products will depend on our ability to manufacture and distribute our composite building products 
development  formulation  manufacturing  and commercialization of our composite building products require significant testing and technical expertise and our efforts may not be successful 
growth of our composite building products business requires ongoing market acceptance 
our composite building products business is subject to intense competition  particularly in the decking market  from traditional wood products and other composite lumber manufacturers  many of whom have greater financial  technical  and marketing resources than we do 
as a result  we may be unable to compete successfully in this market 
we have limited experience manufacturing these products at volume  cost  and quality levels sufficient to satisfy expected demand  and we have in the past and may continue to encounter difficulties in connection with any large scale manufacturing or commercialization of these products 
our capacity may not be sufficient to meet demand without significant additional investment 
in addition  the majority of our production is dependent upon a single piece of equipment 
if that equipment were to fail for an extended period of time  it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues from this business in that period 
we rely on distributors in the building products industry to market  distribute  and sell our products 
we may be unable to produce our products in sufficient quantity to interest or retain these distributors or to add new distributors 
in addition  the announcement of our proposed sale of the composites business and warranty issues may impact our relationships with our existing and proposed new distributors and may cause them to reduce their purchases of our products 
if we are unable to distribute our products effectively  our revenues will decline and we will have to incur additional expenses to market these products directly 
the failure of our composite building products to perform over long periods of time could result in potential liabilities 
our composite building products are relatively new  have not been on the market for long periods of time  and may be used in applications about which we may have little knowledge or limited experience 
because we have limited historical experience  we may be unable to predict the potential liabilities related to product warranty or product liability issues 
if our products fail to perform over their warranty periods  we may not have the ability to protect ourselves adequately against this potential liability  which could adversely affect our operating results 
in and  we experienced a significant increase in warranty claims and warranty expense related to our composite decking products including  but not limited to  contraction of certain deck boards and excessive oxidation that affects the integrity of the plastic used in some of our decking products 
included in the increased warranty expense is the cost of exchanging material held by our distributors with new material that  we believe  is not susceptible to this oxidation issue  and our best estimate of costs related to future potential valid claims arising from installed product 
although we increased the warranty provisions accordingly  we cannot guarantee that the reserves established will be sufficient if we incur warranty claims higher than 
table of contents kadant inc annual report anticipated 
in addition  there can be no assurance that other problems will not develop 
a continued high level of warranty claims or expenses and or failure of our products to perform or to be accepted in the marketplace would have an adverse impact on the profitability of our business and our ability to sell the composites business on favorable terms 
economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our composite building products 
demand for our composite building products is affected by several factors beyond our control  including economic conditions 
recent demand for our products has been driven  in part  by the availability of low interest mortgage and home equity loans 
a further increase in interest rates or tightened credit could adversely affect demand for home remodeling projects  including demand for our products 
seasonality and weather conditions could adversely affect our business 
in general  the building products industry experiences seasonal fluctuations in sales  particularly in the fourth and first quarters  when holidays and adverse weather conditions in some regions usually reduce the level of home improvement and new construction activity 
in addition  our composite building products are used or installed in outdoor construction applications  and our sales volume  bookings  gross margins  and operating income can be negatively affected by adverse weather 
operating results will tend to be lower in quarters with lower sales  which are not entirely offset by a corresponding reduction in operating costs 
in addition  we may also experience lower gross profit margins in the fourth and first quarters due to seasonal incentive discounts offered to our distributors 
as a result of these factors  we believe sequential period to period comparisons of our operating results are not reliable indicators of future performance  and the operating results for any one quarterly period may not be indicative of operating results to be expected for a full year 
we are dependent on a single mill for the raw material used in our fiber based granules  and we may not be able to obtain raw material on commercially reasonable terms 
in addition  the manufacture of our composite building products and fiber based granules is subject to commodity price risks 
we are dependent on a single paper mill for the fiber used in the manufacture of our fiber based granules and composite building products 
this mill has the exclusive right to supply the papermaking byproducts used in the manufacturing process 
although we believe our relationship with the mill is good  the mill could decide not to renew its contract with us at the end of  or may not agree to renew on commercially reasonable terms 
if this were to occur  we would be forced to find an alternative supply for this raw material 
we may be unable to find an alternative supply on commercially reasonable terms or could incur excessive transportation costs if an alternative supplier were found  which would increase our manufacturing costs and might prevent prices for our products from being competitive 
in addition  we use natural gas in the production of our fiber based granular products 
we may manage our exposure to natural gas price fluctuations by entering into short term forward contracts to purchase specified quantities of natural gas from a supplier 
we may not be able to effectively manage our exposure to natural gas price fluctuations 
our composite building products also contain plastics  which are subject to wide fluctuations in pricing and availability 
higher energy costs can increase the price of plastic significantly and rapidly 
we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities at reasonable prices  which would adversely affect our profitability and ability to produce a sufficient quantity of our products or to produce our products at competitive prices 
our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result 
we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies  products  and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace 
our success depends in part on our ability to 
table of contents kadant inc annual report develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the united states and in other countries 
we own numerous us and foreign patents  and we intend to file additional applications  as appropriate  for patents covering our products 
patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us  and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented  and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages 
a patent relating to our fiber based granular products expired in the second quarter of as a result  we could be subject to increased competition in this market  which could have an adverse effect on this business 
in addition  competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies 
intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries  which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position 
we could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others 
an unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
in addition  as our patents expire  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how to protect our products 
we cannot be sure the steps we have taken or will take in the future will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information and intellectual property 
we seek to protect trade secrets and proprietary know how  in part  through confidentiality agreements with our collaborators  employees  and consultants 
these agreements may be breached  we may not have adequate remedies for any breach  and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors 
third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights 
we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages  as well as injunctive or other equitable relief  which could effectively block our ability to make  use  sell  distribute  or market our products and services in the united states or abroad 
in the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us  or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology  we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents 
however  we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful 
our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prohibit the sale  manufacture  or distribution of our products and  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate and the effect of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  we may not be able to reliably predict future revenues and profitability  and unexpected changes may cause us to adjust our operations 
a large proportion of our costs are fixed  due in part to our significant selling  research and development  and manufacturing costs 
thus  small declines in revenues could disproportionately affect our operating results 
other factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include failure of our products to pass contractually agreed upon acceptance tests  which would delay or prohibit recognition of revenues under sab no 
adverse changes in demand for and market acceptance of our products  competitive pressures resulting in lower sales prices of our products  adverse changes in the pulp and paper industry  delays or problems in our introduction of new products  our competitors announcements of new products  services  or technological innovations  contractual liabilities incurred by us related to guarantees of our product performance  
table of contents kadant inc annual report increased costs of raw materials or supplies  including the cost of energy  and changes in the timing of product orders 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents  under delaware law  and in our shareholder rights plan could prevent or delay transactions that our shareholders may favor 
provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage  delay  or prevent a merger or acquisition that our shareholders may consider favorable  including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
for example  these provisions authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock without any need for action by shareholders  provide for a classified board of directors with staggered three year terms  require supermajority shareholder voting to effect various amendments to our charter and bylaws  eliminate the ability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders  prohibit shareholder action by written consent  and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings 
in addition  our board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan intended to protect shareholders in the event of an unfair or coercive offer to acquire our company and to provide our board of directors with adequate time to evaluate unsolicited offers 
preferred stock purchase rights have been distributed to our common shareholders pursuant to the rights plan 
this rights plan may have anti takeover effects 
the rights plan will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms that our board of directors does not believe are in our best interests and those of our shareholders and may discourage  delay  or prevent a merger or acquisition that shareholders may consider favorable  including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition 
we manage our exposure to these risks through our regular operating and financing activities 
additionally  we use short term forward contracts to manage certain exposures to foreign currencies 
we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries local currencies 
we do not engage in extensive foreign currency hedging activities  however  the purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect our local currency cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
our forward foreign exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in us dollars 
gains and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as offsets to gains and losses resulting from the transactions being hedged 
we do not enter into speculative foreign currency agreements 
interest rates our cash and cash equivalents are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in a change in interest income due to the difference between the current interest rates on cash and cash equivalents and the variable rates to which these financial instruments may adjust in the future 
a decrease in year end interest rates would have resulted in a negative impact on our net income of million in both and currency exchange rates we generally view our investment in foreign subsidiaries in a functional currency other than our reporting currency as long term 
our investment in foreign subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros  
table of contents kadant inc annual report british pounds sterling  mexican pesos  and canadian dollars 
the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders investment 
a depreciation in functional currencies at year end and  relative to the us dollar  would have resulted in a reduction in shareholders investment of million and million  respectively 
the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is the estimated amount that we would pay or receive upon termination of the contracts  taking into account the change in foreign currency exchange rates 
a depreciation in year end and foreign currency exchange rates related to our contracts would have resulted in an increase in unrealized losses on forward foreign exchange contracts of million in and no impact in since we use forward foreign exchange contracts as hedges of firm purchase and sale commitments  the unrealized gain or loss on forward foreign currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the hedged items
