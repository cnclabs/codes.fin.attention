item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview for purposes of this discussion and analysis section  reference is made to the table below and the company s consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item we have two principal operating groups maintenance products and electrical products 
the group labeled as other consists of sahlman and sesco 
two business units formerly included in the electrical products group  gc waldom and hamilton  and one business formerly included in the maintenance products group  duckback  have been classified as discontinued operations for the periods prior to their sale 
duckback was sold on september   gc waldom was sold on april   and hamilton was sold on october  since the recapitalization  the company s management has been focused on the following restructuring and cost reduction initiatives o consolidation of facilities manufacturing  distribution and office facilities closed or consolidated including expected to be closed during  manufacture and distribution of each business unit centralized  electrical products manufacturing outsourced to asia 
o divestitures of non core operations non core business units have been sold or otherwise exited and proceeds have been applied to reduce debt 
o selling general and administrative sg a cost rationalization restructured duplicative corporate and support functions  overhead reduced  implemented shared sales  administrative and support services model 
o organizational changes across the board review of management talent and key hires made at both the corporate and operational levels 
with these initiatives nearly complete  the company s focus has shifted to sustaining revenue growth and containing raw material costs 
our future cost reductions are expected to continue to come from process improvements such as lean manufacturing and six sigma  value engineering products  improved sourcing purchasing and lean administration 
end user demand for our maintenance and electrical products is relatively stable and recurring  particularly in comparison to other traditional manufacturing segments 
demand for products in our markets is strong and supported by the necessity of the products to users  creating a steady and predictable market 
in the core janitorial sanitary and foodservice segments  sanitary and health standards create a steady flow of ongoing demand 
the consumable or short life nature of most of the products used for cleaning applications primarily floor pads  hand pads  and mops  brooms and brushes means that they are replaced frequently  creating further demand stability 
during the past few years  we did experience limited recession driven sales declines  which we believe was primarily attributable to both reductions in inventory held by distributors as well as reduced end user consumption caused by declines in airport occupancy particularly after september th and general hospital occupancy 
in addition  many of our electrical products can be characterized as value items that are frequently lost or discarded  with subsequent replacement ensuring continuing and stable demand 
this is particularly the case with electrical cords  which consistently experience strong sales ahead of the holiday season 
the markets in which we compete are expected to experience steady growth over the next several years 
our core commercial cleaning product markets are expected to grow at rates approximating gross domestic product gdp  driven by increasing sanitary standards as a result of heightened health concerns 
in addition  the improvement in general economic conditions will increase demand for katy s cleaning products  due to higher commercial occupancy rates and increased demand for travel and hospitality industries 
the consumer plastics market as a whole is relatively mature  with its growth characteristics linked to household expenditures 
demand is driven by the increasing competition of material possessions by north american households and the desire of consumers to store those possessions in an attractive and orderly manner 
demand for consumer plastic storage products is also typically stable  due to consumer perception of these products as value items 
the market for automotive storage units  is driven by sales of trucks  sports utility vehicles suv s and cross utility vehicles cuv s which grew at a combined average rate of per annum between and end users are relatively insensitive to both price and brand name offering  instead focusing on product quality and size 
we estimate that the north american market for cords and work lights will grow at above gdp growth rates  driven by the growing number of suburban homes particularly those with outdoor spaces and the growth in the use of outdoor appliances 
the market for surge protectors and multiple outlet products is also expected to grow at above gdp growth rates driven by the continued use in consumer purchasers of appliances  computers  home entertainment equipment  and other electronic equipment  as well as the growing public awareness of the need to protect these products from power surges 
key elements in achieving profitability in the maintenance products group include maintaining a low cost structure  from a production  distribution and administrative standpoint  providing outstanding customer service and containing raw material costs especially plastic resins or raising prices to shift these higher costs to our customers for our plastic products 
in addition to continually striving to reduce our cost structure  we are seeking to offset pricing challenges by developing new products for the consumer markets  as new products or beneficial modifications of existing products increase demand from our customers  provide novelty to the consumer  and offer an opportunity for favorable pricing from customers in the national mass merchant retail area 
retention of customers  or more specifically  product lines with those customers  is also very important in the mass merchant retail area  given the vast size of these national accounts 
since the fourth quarter of  we centralized our customer service and administrative functions for ccp divisions jansan plastics  abrasives glit microtron portion only  textiles and filters and grillbricks in one location  allowing customers to order products from any ccp commercial unit on one purchase order 
we expect to add the customer service and administrative functions for the remaining abrasives operations during we believe that operating these business units as a cohesive unit will improve customer service in that our customers purchasing processes will be simplified  as will follow up on order status  billing  collection and other related functions 
we believe that this may increase customer loyalty  help in attracting new customers and lead to increased top line sales in future years 
key elements in achieving profitability in the electrical products group are in many ways similar to those mentioned for our maintenance products group 
the achievement and maintenance of a low cost structure is critical given the significant level of foreign competition  primarily from asia and latin america 
for this reason  in december and december  woods us and woods canada  respectively  ceased all manufacturing and initiated a fully outsourced strategy for their consumer electrical products 
customer service  specifically the ability to fill orders at a rate designated by our customers  is very important to customer retention  given seasonal sales pressures in the consumer electrical area 
woods us and woods canada are both subject to seasonal sales trends in connection with the holiday shopping season  with stronger sales and profits realized in the third and early fourth quarters 
retention of customers is critical in the electrical products group  given the size of national accounts 
see outlook for in this section for discussion of recent developments related to the maintenance products group and the electrical products group

sg a as a percentage of sales declined from in to in this decrease can be primarily attributed to maintaining these costs despite the increase in net sales 
the operating loss increased by million to million  principally due to higher impairments of long lived assets and lower gross margins  partially offset by lower severance  restructuring and related charges 
overall  we reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of million

net sales maintenance products group net sales from the maintenance products group decreased from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december   a decrease of 
overall  this decline was primarily due to lower volumes of sales of  partially offset by higher pricing of and the favorable impact of exchange rates of 
sales volume for the consumer plastics business unit  which sells primarily to mass merchant customers  was significantly lower due to the elimination of certain product lines with major outlet customers and to a lesser extent due to promotions in which did not recur in we also experienced volume declines in our abrasives business unit in the us due to shipping and production inefficiencies caused by the delayed consolidation of two abrasives facilities into the wrens  georgia facility and a fire at our facility in wrens in the fourth quarter of that disrupted production for several weeks 
these decreases in abrasives sales were partially offset by stronger sales of roofing products to the construction industry 
we experienced volume gains in certain of our businesses that sell to commercial customers  particularly in our abrasives canada  textiles  filters and grillbricks business units 
abrasives canada sales benefited from an improving north american economy  while sales of textiles and filters and grillbricks products benefited from the ability of customers to order products from all ccp divisions on one purchase order 
the jansan plastics business unit experienced volume declines primarily due to bid business obtained in but not repeated in  customer buy ins to achieve certain rebates in also not repeated in and lost market share 
lower jansan plastics volume was partially offset by price increases implemented to combat accelerating raw material costs 
uk jansan plastics volumes increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of spraychem limited on april  the uk consumer plastics and uk jansan plastics business units also benefited from favorable exchange rates in versus electrical products group the electrical products group s sales improved from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
sales improved as a result of a higher pricing of  an increase in volume of  and favorable currency translation of 
multiple selling price increases were implemented throughout at woods us and to a lesser extent at woods canada to offset the rising cost of copper and pvc 
volume at woods us benefited principally from the acquisition of significant new product lines with both existing and new customers 
woods canada experienced a slight volume increase as sales to its two largest customers benefited from new product offerings and higher demand was partially offset by the loss of certain lines of business at certain customers 
sales at woods canada were also favorably impacted by a stronger canadian dollar versus the us dollar in versus operating income operating income loss change margin margin margin maintenance products group electrical products group unallocated corporate expense impairments of long lived assets severance  restructuring and related charges operating loss maintenance products group the maintenance products group s operating income decreased from million of net sales during the year ended december  to an operating loss of million of net sales for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to lower volumes and higher raw material costs in versus that were only partially recovered through higher selling prices  as well as a decline in the profitability of our abrasives business resulting from shipping and production inefficiencies caused by the delayed consolidation of two facilities into the wrens  georgia facility and the fire at our facility in wrens in the th quarter of that disrupted production for several weeks 
operating results were positively impacted by million of incremental depreciation in related to the revision of the estimated useful lives of certain manufacturing assets  effective january  operating income was also favorably impacted through benefits realized from the implementation of cost reduction strategies 
electrical products group the electrical products group s operating income increased from million of net sales for the year ended december  to million of net sales for the year ended december   an increase of 
the increase in profitability was due to the strong volume increases at the woods us business unit as well as improved margins due to the closure of the woods canada manufacturing facility in december and the completion of a fully outsourced product strategy for that business 
overall  margins declined as a result of selling price increases especially at woods canada not quite keeping pace with the increasing costs of copper and pvc and the impact of increased lower margin direct import sales 
corporate corporate operating expenses decreased from million in to million in principally due to lower casualty insurance costs  lower bonus expense resulting from a decline in operating performance and decreased expense for stock appreciation rights due to a lower stock price affecting the variable plan accounting for these awards 
impairments of long lived assets during the fourth quarter of  we recognized an impairment loss of million related to the us plastics business units jansan plastics  consumer plastics and container see discussion of reporting units in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item including million related to goodwill  million related to machinery and equipment  million related to a customer list intangible and million related to a trademark 
in the fourth quarter of  the profitability of the consumer plastics business unit declined sharply as we were unable to pass along sufficient selling price increases to combat the accelerating cost of resin a key raw material used in all of the us plastics units 
we believe that our future earnings and cash flow could be negatively impacted to the extent further increases in resin and other raw material costs cannot be offset or recovered through higher selling prices 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  we through an independent third party valuation firm performed an analysis of discounted future cash flows which indicated that the book value of the us plastics units was significantly greater than the fair value of those businesses 
in addition  as a result of the goodwill analysis  we also assessed whether there had been an impairment of the long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company concluded that the book value of equipment  a customer list intangible and trademark associated with the us plastics business unit significantly exceeded the fair value and impairment had occurred 
also in  we recorded impairment charges of million related to property and equipment at our metal truck box business unit and million related to certain assets at the woods us business unit 
impairment charges in included million related to idle and obsolete equipment  tooling and leasehold improvements at warson road  hazelwood  bridgeton  and the santa fe springs  california metals facility  million of costs related to the partial closure of abrasives facilities in lawrence  massachusetts and pineville  north carolina and the consolidation into the wrens  georgia facility  million of obsolete molds and tooling at our uk consumer plastics facility and million associated with the write down of certain equipment at woods canada and woods us as a result of the closure of the manufacturing operations at both business units 
in addition  million of goodwill and patents of the abrasives canada business unit were impaired as it was determined that future cash flows of this business could not support the carrying value of its intangible assets 
this business unit has experienced a decline in profitability in recent years principally as a result of increasing foreign competition 
severance  restructuring and related charges operating results for the company during the years ended december  and were negatively impacted by severance  restructuring and related charges of million and million  respectively 
charges in related to adjustments to previously established non cancelable lease liabilities for abandoned facilities million  a non cancelable lease accrual and severance as a result of the shutdown of manufacturing and severance at woods canada million  the restructuring of the abrasives business million  costs for the movement of inventory and equipment in connection with the consolidation of st 
louis manufacturing and distribution facilities million  the shutdown and relocation of a procurement office in asia million  costs incurred for the consolidation of administrative functions for ccp million  and expenses for the closure of ccp canada s facility and the subsequent consolidation into the woods canada facility million 
the largest of these charges in related to non cancelable leases at abandoned facilities as a result of the consolidation of the ccp facilities in the st 
louis area into ccp s largest and most modern plant in bridgeton  missouri million 
a charge of million was recorded related to severance associated with the shutdown of the woods canada manufacturing operations in december charges of million were also incurred relating to the restructuring of the abrasives business unit  principally to consolidate the lawrence  massachusetts and pineville  north carolina facilities into the newly expanded wrens  georgia location 
we also incurred charges in related to severance costs for headcount reductions million  an adjustment to a non cancelable lease accrual due to a change in sub lease assumptions at woods us million  the consolidation of the customer service and administrative functions for ccp million  costs related to the closure of ccp s metals facility in santa fe springs  california million and consulting fees associated with product outsourcing strategies million 
other upon review of sahlman s results for and the first half of  and after initial study of the status of the shrimp industry and markets in the united states  we evaluated the business further to determine if there had been a loss in the value of the investment that was other than temporary 
based upon the results of a third party appraisal  we estimated the fair value of the sahlman business through a liquidation value analysis whereby all of sahlman s assets would be sold and all of its obligations would be settled 
also based on the aforementioned appraisal  we evaluated the business by using various discounted cash flow analyses  estimating future free cash flows of the business with different assumptions regarding growth  and reducing the value of the business arrived at through this analysis by its outstanding debt 
all values were then multiplied by  katy s investment percentage 
the answers derived by each of the three assumption models were then probability weighted 
as a result  katy concluded that million was a reasonable estimate of the value of its investment in sahlman  and therefore a charge of million was recorded in the third quarter of to reduce the carrying value of the investment 
based on our assessment at december   we continue to believe that million is a reasonable estimate of our investment in sahlman 
interest expense decreased by million in versus  primarily due to the write off of unamortized debt costs of million in resulting from a february refinancing and other reductions in overall availability 
the remaining decrease in interest expense of million was due mainly to slightly lower average borrowings during  principally as a result of applying the proceeds from the sale of non core businesses in to repay debt 
other  net for the year ended december  included the write off of certain receivables related to businesses disposed of prior to million and the write off of fees and expenses associated with a financing which we chose not to pursue million 
other  net for the year ended december  included the write off of certain receivables related to businesses disposed prior to million  realized foreign exchange losses million and costs associated with the proposed sale of certain subsidiaries million 
the gain on sale of assets in and were primarily due to the sales of excess real estate 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  reflects current expense for state and foreign income taxes offset by the reduction of certain tax reserves and the recognition of certain foreign deferred tax assets 
during the year ended december   a tax benefit of million was recorded on pre tax loss to the extent a provision was provided for the gain on sale of discontinued businesses and income from operations of discontinued businesses 
a further benefit was not recorded due to the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
also in  million and million of income tax expense were attributable to income from discontinued businesses and the gain on the sale of discontinued businesses  respectively 
discontinued operations the gc waldom and duckback business units are reported as discontinued operations for the year ended december  there was no discontinued operations activity for gc waldom reported income of million net of tax in the first half of we sold gc waldom on april  and recognized a loss net of tax of million in the second quarter of as a result of the sale 
duckback generated income of million net of tax in the first nine months of we sold duckback on september  and recognized a gain net of tax of million in the third quarter of as a result of the sale 
compared to overview our consolidated net sales for the company declined million  or from levels  due to a volume decline of and lower pricing of  partially offset by favorable currency translation of 
gross margins held constant at approximately as the benefit of implemented cost reduction strategies  offset lower pricing  higher resin costs and atypically high depreciation see operating income maintenance products group below 
sg a as a percentage of sales declined from in to in the operating deficit was reduced significantly from million to million mostly as a result of reduced severance  restructuring and related charges  lower impairments of long lived assets and the loss on the sesco joint venture in overall  we reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of million 
per share 
for the year ended december   versus a net loss attributable to common shareholders of million  or per share in the same period of during the year ended december   we reported income from discontinued operations of million  net of tax

the tables and narrative below summarize the key factors in the year to year changes in operating results 
net sales maintenance products group net sales from the maintenance products group decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of 
the decline was due to a volume decrease of  partially offset by the favorable impact of exchange rates of 
the decline in sales is attributed to both commercial and consumer customers 
on the commercial side  sales were lower at the abrasives canada business unit  primarily due to increased foreign competition  and in the abrasives business unit  primarily because a major customer increased their supplier base in in addition  we believe that the jansan plastics business unit was impacted during the first three quarters of by the general economic conditions and reduced demand for cleaning products  due to commercial real estate vacancy rates and reduced demand in the travel and hospitality industries 
in the fourth quarter  sales for the jansan plastics business unit were higher in than in representing an improvement in the health of the aforementioned industries 
sales were higher in the international markets for katy s commercial and sanitary maintenance products  primarily in the uk jansan plastics unit 
sales for the consumer plastics business unit  which sells primarily to mass merchant retail customers  were lower due to the loss of certain product lines with major retailers and to a lesser extent  downward pricing pressures and allowance  rebate  and other programs 
the uk consumer plastics business benefited overall from stronger volumes and favorable exchange rates  partially offset by price erosion similar to that in the jansan plastics business 
electrical products group the electrical product group s sales increased from million in to million in  an increase of 
an increase in volume of and favorable currency translation of was partially offset by lower pricing of 
the woods us business unit experienced a year over year increase in volume as a result of a strong fourth quarter in the improvement was primarily due to higher volumes of direct import merchandise such as extension cords and power strips  which are shipped directly from our suppliers to our customers 
woods us sales performance in also benefited from the introduction of new surge products  sales to new customers and same store growth for its largest customer  a national home improvement retailer 
offsetting these volume increases was a slight reduction in pricing which was implemented to remain competitive in certain product lines 
higher sales at woods canada in compared to were principally due to the impact of a stronger canadian dollar versus the us dollar 
this increase was offset partially by lower pricing mostly due to a shift during to direct import products 
other sales from other operations decreased by million  as a result of the sesco waste to energy operation being turned over to a third party in april operating income operating income loss change margin margin margin maintenance products group electrical products group other unallocated corporate expense impairments of long lived assets severance  restructuring and related charges loss on sesco joint venture transaction operating loss maintenance products group operating income decreased by million from million in of net sales to million in of net sales 
an overall decline in net sales for the year mostly due to volume declines along with high raw material costs and atypically high depreciation contributed to the reduced profitability excluding severance  restructuring and related charges and impairments of long lived assets of this group in profitability for the year was lower at the metal truck box  abrasives and abrasives canada business units  due to volume related issues  while the consumer plastics and consumer plastics uk businesses were negatively impacted by top line pricing pressures and an unfavorable mix of lower margin products 
in addition  all consumer plastics and jansan plastics businesses worldwide experienced higher raw material costs principally resin in operating results were also negatively impacted by million of incremental depreciation related to the revision of the estimated useful lives of certain manufacturing assets  specifically molds and tooling equipment used in the manufacture of plastic products  from seven to five years  effective january  this change in estimate was made following significant impairments to these types of assets recorded during these shortfalls were partially offset by improved results at the jansan plastics business unit which benefited from the implementation of cost reduction strategies 
operating results continue to be favorably impacted by the numerous cost reduction initiatives including the consolidation of our manufacturing and distribution facilities in the st 
louis area 
in the fourth quarter of  net sales were only down from the fourth quarter of as compared to a decline for the first nine months of the year 
operating income for the fourth quarter of was million as compared to million in the fourth quarter of  an increase of 
electrical products group the electrical products group continued its solid performance in  once again driven primarily by improved sales volume over  and secondarily  by higher margins over the prior year 
operating income jumped from million of net sales in to million of net sales in  an increase of 
profitability in was positively impacted by cost reduction strategies at both woods us and woods canada 
after significant study and research into different sourcing alternatives  we decided that woods us and woods canada would source substantially all of their products from asia 
in december  woods us shut down all of its manufacturing facilities  which were in suburban indianapolis and in southern indiana 
this was the most significant initiative benefiting  resulting in approximately million in savings 
we believe that restructuring steps executed in and related to the woods us and woods canada businesses will allow those businesses to remain competitive within their markets 
the fully outsourced product strategy has reduced headcount at woods us by employees effective in december and woods canada by employees effective in december 
cost reduction initiatives at woods canada to reduce product and variable costs also had a favorable impact on higher sales volumes and favorable currency translation also aided in maintaining margins 
during  woods us incurred a loss of million related to obsolete raw material and packaging inventory on hand which could not be utilized following the shutdown of its manufacturing facilities 
corporate corporate operating expenses increased from million in to million in principally due to higher casualty insurance costs  and increased expense for stock appreciation rights due to an increasing stock price affecting the variable plan accounting for these awards 
impairments of long lived assets the company recorded impairments of long lived assets of million during and million during charges in included million related to idle and obsolete equipment  tooling and leasehold improvements at warson road  hazelwood  bridgeton  and the santa fe springs  california metals facility  million of costs related to the closure of abrasives facilities in lawrence  massachusetts and pineville  north carolina and the consolidation into the wrens  georgia facility  million of obsolete molds and tooling at our uk consumer plastics facility and million associated with the write down of certain equipment at woods canada and woods us as a result of the closure of the manufacturing operations at both business units 
in addition  million of goodwill and patents of the abrasives canada business unit were impaired as it was determined that future cash flows of this business could not support the carrying value of its intangible assets 
this business unit has experienced a decline in profitability in recent years principally as a result of increasing foreign competition 
in  ccp impaired property  plant and equipment primarily molds and tooling assets and a customer list intangible by million and million  respectively 
the impairments were primarily associated with assets used in the consumer plastics business  and were the result of analyses indicating insufficient future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets to cover the carrying values of the assets 
given the unique nature of molds for specific products  the fair values are often less than historical cost  resulting in impairments 
the textiles business unit recorded asset impairments of million  resulting from management decisions on the future use of certain manufacturing assets in their atlanta  georgia facility 
in addition  woods us impaired million of equipment as a result of the closure of its manufacturing operations in december severance  restructuring and related charges operating results for the company during the years ended december  and were negatively impacted by severance  restructuring and related charges of million and million  respectively 
the largest of these charges in related to non cancelable leases at abandoned facilities as a result of the consolidation of the ccp facilities in the st 
louis area into ccp s largest and most modern plant in bridgeton  missouri million 
a charge of million was recorded related to severance associated with the shutdown of the woods canada manufacturing operations in december charges of million were also incurred relating to the restructuring of the abrasives business unit  principally to consolidate the lawrence  massachusetts and pineville  north carolina facilities into the newly expanded wrens  georgia location 
we also incurred charges in related to severance costs for headcount reductions million  an adjustment to a non cancelable lease accrual due to a change in sub lease assumptions at woods us million  the consolidation of the customer service and administrative functions for ccp million  costs related to the closure of ccp s metals facility in santa fe springs  california million and consulting fees associated with product outsourcing strategies million 
during  the company recorded million related to the st 
louis facility consolidation mostly for non cancelable lease payments  million in consulting fees associated with product outsourcing strategies  relating to the woods us  woods canada and textiles business units  million for severance and other exit costs related to the shut down of all woods us manufacturing operations  million for severance costs related to various headcount reductions  mostly in the management level of various business units  million for legal fees and involuntary termination benefits related to sesco  and million related to the consolidation of the customer service and administrative functions for ccp 
sesco joint venture transaction during  we recorded a charge of million consisting of the discounted value of an obligation created by katy to the third party who took over daily operation of the sesco facility  the carrying value of certain assets contributed to the partnership formed in connection with this transaction and costs to close the transaction 
other upon review of sahlman s results for and the first half of  and after initial study of the status of the shrimp industry and markets in the united states  we evaluated the business further to determine if there had been a loss in the value of the investment that was other than temporary 
based upon the results of a third party appraisal  we estimated the fair value of the sahlman business through a liquidation value analysis whereby all of sahlman s assets would be sold and all of its obligations would be settled 
also based on the aforementioned appraisal  we evaluated the business by using various discounted cash flow analyses  estimating future free cash flows of the business with different assumptions regarding growth  and reducing the value of the business arrived at through this analysis by its outstanding debt 
all values were then multiplied by  katy s investment percentage 
the answers derived by each of the three assumption models were then probability weighted 
as a result  katy concluded that million was a reasonable estimate of the value of its investment in sahlman  and therefore a charge of million was recorded in the third quarter of to reduce the carrying value of the investment 
interest expense was essentially unchanged in as compared to during  we wrote off million of unamortized debt issuance costs due to the reduction in our borrowing capacity as a result of the refinancing of our debt obligations in february the amount of this write off is included in interest expense 
the offsetting decrease in interest expense in was due mainly to lower average borrowings during  principally as a result of applying proceeds from the sale of non core businesses in and to a lesser extent  lower interest rates contributed to the decline in interest expense 
other  net in included the write off of certain deferred payment receivables associated with businesses disposed of prior to million and realized foreign exchange losses million 
other  net in was comprised primarily of realized foreign exchange losses 
the gain on sale of assets in was primarily due to the sales of excess real estate 
our effective tax rate in was  indicating that a million tax benefit was recorded on a million pretax loss from continuing operations 
a tax benefit was recorded on pre tax loss to the extent a provision was provided for the gain on sale of discontinued businesses and income from operations of discontinued businesses 
a further benefit was not recorded due to the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
see deferred income taxes in critical accounting policies and note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item  for further discussion of income tax accounting 
in  we recorded a million transitional goodwill impairment net of tax  as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 which is shown on the consolidated statements of operations as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item for a further discussion of goodwill impairments 
discontinued operations three business units are reported as discontinued operations for and hamilton precisions metals  lp hamilton  gc waldom and duckback 
hamilton generated million net of tax of income in prior to its sale on october  and a gain net of tax of million was recognized in the fourth quarter of as a result of the sale 
gc waldom reported operating income of million net of tax in prior to its sale on april   versus a million operating loss in nearly the entire operating loss of gc waldom in was the result of asset valuation adjustments in anticipation of a sale of this business unit 
a loss net of tax of million was recognized in the second quarter of as a result of the gc waldom sale 
duckback generated operating income of million net of tax in prior to its sale on september  versus million net of tax in a gain net of tax of million was recognized in the third quarter of as a result of the duckback sale 
liquidity and capital resources we require funding for working capital needs and capital expenditures 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and the use of available borrowings under the bank of america credit agreement as defined below provide sufficient liquidity for our operations going forward 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million versus cash and cash equivalents of million at december  also as of december   we had outstanding borrowings of million 
of total capitalization  under the bank of america credit agreement with unused borrowing availability on the revolving credit facility of million 
as of december   we had outstanding borrowings of million 
of total capitalization 
we used cash flow from operations of million during the year ended december  versus the million provided by cash flow from operations during the year ended december  the increased use of cash flow from operations during versus was primarily attributable to higher inventories in due to higher material costs and increased levels to support higher volumes in the electrical products group and provide higher levels of customer service 
we expect these liquidity trends to reverse in as capital expenditures are expected to be lower in  inventory is being reduced and other elements of working capital are being managed 
we have a number of obligations and commitments  which are listed on the schedule later in this section entitled contractual and commercial obligations 
we have considered all of these obligations and commitments in structuring our capital resources to ensure that they can be met 
see the notes accompanying the table in that section for further discussions of those items 
we believe that given our strong working capital base  additional liquidity could be obtained through additional debt financing  if necessary 
however  there is no guarantee that such financing could be obtained 
in addition  we are continually evaluating alternatives relating to the sale of excess assets and divestitures of certain of our business units 
asset sales and business divestitures present opportunities to provide additional liquidity by de leveraging our financial position 
bank of america credit agreement on april   we completed a refinancing of our outstanding indebtedness the refinancing and entered into a new agreement with bank of america business capital formerly fleet capital corporation the bank of america credit agreement 
like the previous credit agreement with fleet capital corporation  the bank of america credit agreement is a million facility with a million term loan term loan and a million revolving credit facility revolving credit facility with essentially the same terms as the previous credit agreement 
the bank of america credit agreement is an asset based lending agreement and involves a syndicate of four banks  all of which participated in the syndicate from the previous credit agreement 
since the inception of the previous credit agreement  we had repaid million of the previous term loan 
the ability to repay that loan on a faster than anticipated timetable was primarily due to funds generated by the sale of gc waldom in april  the sale of duckback in september and various sales of excess real estate 
the bank of america credit agreement  and the additional borrowing ability under the revolving credit facility obtained by incurring new term debt  results in three important benefits related to our long term strategy additional borrowing capacity to invest in capital expenditures and or acquisitions key to our strategic direction  increased working capital flexibility to build inventory when necessary to accommodate lower cost outsourced finished goods inventory and the ability to borrow locally in canada and the united kingdom and provide a natural hedge against currency fluctuations 
below is a summary of the sources and uses associated with the funding of the bank of america credit agreement in thousands sources term loan incremental borrowings  uses repayment of revolving credit facility borrowings  certain costs associated with the bank of america credit agreement  the revolving credit facility has an expiration date of april  and its borrowing base is determined by eligible inventory and accounts receivable 
the term loan also has a final maturity date of april  with quarterly payments of million 
a final payment of million is scheduled to be paid in april the term loan is collateralized by our property  plant and equipment 
our borrowing base under the bank of america credit agreement is reduced by the outstanding amount of standby and commercial letters of credit 
vendors  financial institutions and other parties with whom we conduct business may require letters of credit in the future that either do not exist today or would be at higher amounts than those that exist today 
currently  our largest letters of credit relate to our casualty insurance programs 
at december   total outstanding letters of credit were million 
all extensions of credit under the bank of america credit agreement are collateralized by a first priority security interest in and lien upon the capital stock of each material domestic subsidiary of the capital stock of certain foreign subsidiaries  and all of our present and future assets and properties 
customary financial covenants and restrictions apply under the bank of america credit agreement 
until september   interest accrued on the revolving credit facility borrowings at basis points over applicable libor rate and at basis points over libor for borrowings under the term loan 
in accordance with the bank of america credit agreement  our margins ie the interest rate spread above libor increased by basis points in the fourth quarter of based upon certain leverage measurements 
margins increased an additional basis points in the first quarter of based on our leverage ratio as defined in the bank of america credit agreement as of december  and will increase another basis points upon the effective date of the third amendment see below 
also in accordance with the bank of america credit agreement  margins on the term borrowings will drop basis points if the balance of the term loan is reduced below million 
interest accrues at higher margins on prime rates for swing loans  the amounts of which were nominal at december  we incurred additional debt issuance costs in associated with the bank of america credit agreement 
additionally  at the time of the inception of the bank of america credit agreement  we had approximately million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the previous credit agreement 
the remainder of the previously capitalized costs  along with the capitalized costs from the bank of america credit agreement  will be amortized over the life of the bank of america credit agreement through april based on the pro rata reduction in borrowing capacity from a previous refinancing of the company s credit facility and in the connection with the sale of assets primarily the gc waldom and duckback businesses to repay the term loan under the previous agreement  we charged to expense million of previously unamortized debt issuance costs during also  during the first quarter of  we incurred fees and expenses of million associated with a financing which we chose not to pursue 
the revolving credit facility under the bank of america credit agreement requires lockbox agreements which provide for all receipts to be swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding 
these agreements  combined with the existence of a material adverse effect mae clause in the bank of america credit agreement  caused the revolving credit facility to be classified as a current liability except as noted below  per guidance in the emerging issues task force issue no 
 balance sheet classification of borrowings outstanding under revolving credit agreements that include both a subjective acceleration clause and a lock box arrangement 
we do not expect to repay  or be required to repay  within one year  the balance of the revolving credit facility classified as a current liability 
the mae clause  which is a fairly typical requirement in commercial credit agreements  allows the lenders to require the loan to become due if they determine there has been a material adverse effect on our operations  business  properties  assets  liabilities  condition or prospects 
the classification of the revolving credit facility as a current liability except as noted above is a result only of the combination of the lockbox agreements and the mae clause 
the bank of america credit agreement does not expire or have a maturity date within one year  but rather has a final expiration date of april  the lender had not notified us of any indication of a mae at december   and we were not in default of any provision of the bank of america credit agreement at december  we were in compliance with the applicable financial covenants in the bank of america credit agreement at december  however  we determined that due to declining profitability in the fourth quarter of  potentially lower profitability in the first half of and the timing of certain restructuring payments  we would not meet our fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the bank of america credit agreement and could potentially exceed our maximum consolidated leverage ratio also as defined in the bank of america credit agreement as of the end of the first  second and third quarters of in anticipation of not achieving the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio or exceeding the maximum consolidated leverage ratio  we obtained an amendment to the bank of america credit agreement the second amendment 
the second amendment applied only to the first three quarters of and the covenants would have returned to their original levels for the fourth quarter of specifically  the second amendment eliminated the fixed charge coverage ratio  increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio  established a minimum consolidated ebitda on a latest twelve months basis for each of the periods and also established a minimum availability the eligible collateral base less outstanding borrowings and letters of credit on each day within the nine month period 
subsequent to the second amendment s effective date  we determined that we would likely not meet our amended financial covenants 
on april   we obtained a further amendment to the bank of america credit agreement the third amendment 
the third amendment eliminates the maximum consolidated leverage ratio and the minimum consolidated ebitda as established by the second amendment and adjusts the minimum availability such that our eligible collateral must exceed the sum of our outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under the revolving credit facility by at least million from the effective date of the third amendment through september  and by at least million from september  until the date we deliver our financial statements for the first quarter of to our lenders 
subsequent to the delivery of the financial statements for the first quarter of  the third amendment reestablishes the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as originally set forth in the bank of america credit agreement 
the third amendment also reduces the maximum allowable capital expenditures for from million to million  and increases the interest rate margins on all of our outstanding borrowings and letters of credit to the largest margins set forth in the bank of america credit agreement 
interest rate margins will return to levels set forth in the bank of america credit agreement subsequent to the delivery of our financial statements for the first quarter of to our lenders 
if we are unable to comply with the terms of amended covenants  we could seek to obtain further amendments and pursue increased liquidity through additional debt financing and or the sale of assets see discussion above 
contractual and commercial obligations we have contractual obligations associated with operating lease agreements many of which relate to our facilities in the ordinary course of business 
our obligations as of december   are summarized below in thousands of dollars due in less due in due in due after contractual cash obligations total than year years years years revolving credit facility

the revolving credit facility expires in april of 
b 
future non cancelable lease rentals are included in the line entitled operating leases  which also includes obligations associated with restructuring activities 
the consolidated balance sheet at december   includes million in discounted liabilities associated with non cancelable operating lease rentals  net of estimated sub lease revenues  related to facilities that have been abandoned as a result of restructuring and consolidation activities 

c 
amount owed to montenay as a result of the sesco partnership  discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
million of this obligation is classified in the consolidated balance sheets as an accrued expense in current liabilities  while the remainder is included in other liabilities  recorded on a discounted basis 

d 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item  sesco  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of katy  is party to a partnership that operates a waste to energy facility  and has certain contractual obligations  for which katy provides certain guarantees 
if the partnership is not able to perform its obligations under the contracts  under certain circumstances sesco and katy could be subject to damages equal to the amount of industrial revenue bonds outstanding which financed construction of the facility less amounts held by the partnership in debt service reserve funds 
katy and sesco do not anticipate non performance by parties to the contracts 
off balance sheet arrangements see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item for a discussion of sesco 
cash flow liquidity was negatively impacted during as a result of lower operating cash flow 
we used million of operating cash compared to operating cash provided during of million 
debt obligations at december  increased million from december  this increase in debt was primarily the result of higher inventory and increased capital expenditures  partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of assets 
operating activities cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating assets and discontinued operations was million in versus million in while we had net losses in both periods  these amounts included many non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  impairments of long lived assets  the write off and amortization of debt issuance costs  the gain or loss on the sale of assets and the change in the ownership of our equity method investment 
we used million and million of cash related to operating assets and liabilities during the years ended december  and  respectively 
our operating cash flow was unfavorably impacted in by an increase in inventory of million  due primarily to higher material costs  and increased levels to support higher volumes in the electrical products group and provide higher levels of customer service 
by the end of  we were turning our inventory at times per year versus times per year in cash of million and million was used in and  respectively  to satisfy severance  restructuring and related obligations 
restructuring and consolidation activities  which are expected to end in  are important to reducing our cost structure to a competitive level 
discontinued operations duckback and gc waldom used million of cash flow in investing activities capital expenditures totaled million in as compared to million in as spending for an equipment replacement program primarily for plastics products in was mostly offset by lower capital expenditures related to restructuring and consolidation activities 
anticipated capital expenditures are expected to be significantly lower in than in  mainly due to an equipment replacement program in we sold additional assets in and for net proceeds of million and million  respectively 
on march   woods canada sold its manufacturing facility for net proceeds of million and immediately entered into a sale leaseback arrangement to allow that business unit to occupy this property as a distribution facility 
on june   ccp sold its vacant metals facility in santa fe springs  california for net proceeds of million 
on february   woods us sold its manufacturing facility in moorseville  for net proceeds of million  of which million was used to repay a mortgage loan on that property 
in addition to the sale of real estate assets  we received aggregate net proceeds of million for the sale of the gc waldom and duckback businesses in financing activities cash flows from financing activities in and reflect the refinancing of our outstanding obligations in april and february  respectively 
overall  debt increased million in versus a decrease of million in direct debt costs  primarily associated with the refinance transactions  totaled million and million in and  respectively 
in  we redeemed for million representing a discount  the remainder of a preferred interest in ccp 
during   shares of common stock were repurchased on the open market for approximately million under our million share repurchase program  while in   shares of common stock were repurchased on the open market for approximately million 
on may   we suspended the program after announcing the resumption of the plan on april  we had previously suspended the program in november there currently are no plans to resume the share repurchase program 
transactions with related and certain other parties in connection with the contico international  llc now ccp acquisition on january   we entered into building lease agreements with newcastle industries  inc newcastle 
lester miller  the former owner of ccp  and a katy director from to  is the majority owner of newcastle 
currently  the hazelwood  missouri facility is the only property leased directly from newcastle 
rental expense for these properties approximates market rates 
related party rental expense for the years ended december   and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
upon our purchase of the common interest of ccp on january   newcastle retained a preferred interest in ccp  represented by preferred units  each with a stated value of  for an aggregate stated value of million 
the preferred interest yielded an cumulative annual return on its stated value while outstanding  payable quarterly in cash 
in connection with the recapitalization  the company entered into an agreement with newcastle to redeem at a discount preferred units  plus accrued distributions thereon  which  as disclosed above  had a stated value prior to the recapitalization of million 
we utilized approximately million of the proceeds from the recapitalization for the purpose of redeeming the preferred units 
the holder of the preferred interest retained preferred units  with a stated value of million 
in connection with a previous credit agreement completed in february  the remaining preferred units were redeemed early at a similar discount 
we paid newcastle million and million of preferred distributions for each of the years ended december  and  respectively  on the preferred units of ccp held by newcastle 
the decreases in distributions were due to the early redemptions of the preferred interest in february which was the remainder of the preferred interest and in june we do not owe any further distributions 
kohlberg co  llc  an affiliate of kohlberg investors iv  llc  whose affiliate holds all  shares of our convertible preferred stock  provides ongoing management oversight and advisory services to katy 
we paid million annually for such services in  and we expect to pay million annually in future years 
severance  restructuring and related charges see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item for a discussion of severance  restructuring and related charges 
outlook for we experienced strong sales performance during from the woods us retail electrical corded products business  offset by lower volumes in our jansan plastics  consumer plastics and abrasives business units 
price increases were passed along to our woods us customers during as a result of the rise in copper prices in late and early and we are implementing additional price increases in while we anticipate a continued strong top line performance from woods us  only modest volume growth is expected 
we continue to implement price increases for the jansan plastics  container and consumer plastics business units and for our metal truck box business in response to higher raw material costs 
however  in the consumer plastics business  we face the continuing challenge of passing through price increases to offset these higher costs  and sales volumes have been and will continue to be negatively impacted as a result of raising prices 
we expect that the continued shipping and production inefficiencies at our abrasives facilities will result in higher operating costs until the consolidation of two facilities into the wrens  georgia facility is completed 
we currently believe this consolidation will occur in and will result in improved profitability of our abrasives business 
the disruption to our abrasives operations in resulted in the loss of certain customers 
while we expect to recover some of these lost sales in the current year  we may experience additional lost sales in early in the fourth quarter of  we experienced a small fire at the wrens facility 
the fire damaged certain production equipment and affected the operations of certain of our production lines 
however  we have been able to continue to operate the remainder of our production lines at this facility and have recently obtained equipment allowing us to operate all product lines at this facility 
cost of goods sold is subject to variability in the prices for certain raw materials  most significantly thermoplastic resins used in the manufacture of plastic products for the jansan plastics and consumer plastics businesses 
prices of plastic resins  such as polyethylene and polypropylene have increased steadily from the latter half of through the early months of management has observed that the prices of plastic resins are driven to an extent by prices for crude oil and natural gas  in addition to other factors specific to the supply and demand of the resins themselves 
we are equally exposed to price changes for copper at our woods us and woods canada business units 
prices for copper increased in late and early  stabilized in a historically high range in mid and increased again in late and early prices for aluminum and steel raw materials used in our metal truck box business  corrugated packaging material and other raw materials have also accelerated over the past year 
we have not employed an active hedging program related to our commodity price risk  but are employing other strategies for managing this risk  including contracting for a certain percentage of resin needs through supply agreements and opportunistic spot purchases 
we have experienced cost increases in the prices of primary raw materials used in our products and inflation on other costs such as packaging materials  utilities and freight 
in total  these cost increases have continued in the first quarter of  and if sustained throughout  would amount to an increase of over million compared to in  we passed on about million of these increases through price increases and are announcing additional price increases in the first and second quarters this year 
in a climate of rising raw material costs and especially in  we experience difficulty in raising prices to shift these higher costs to our customers for our plastic products 
our future earnings may be negatively impacted to the extent further increases in costs for raw materials cannot be recovered or offset through higher selling prices 
we cannot predict the direction our raw material prices will take during and beyond 
since the recapitalization  our management has been focused on a number of restructuring and cost reduction initiatives  including the consolidation of facilities  divestiture of non core operations  selling general and administrative sg a cost rationalization and organizational changes 
in the future  we expect to benefit from various profit enhancing strategies such as process improvements including lean manufacturing and six sigma  value engineering products  improved sourcing purchasing and lean administration 
sg a expenses declined in as a percentage of sales versus and should remain stable as a percentage of sales in we expect to maintain modest headcount and rental costs for our corporate office 
we have completed the process of transferring back office functions of our textiles wilen  abrasives glit microtron portion and filters and grillbricks disco business units from georgia to bridgeton  missouri  the headquarters of ccp 
we expect to consolidate administrative processes at our loren portion of the abrasives business in and will continue to evaluate the possibility of further consolidation of administrative processes 
our cost reduction efforts  integration of back office functions and simplifications of our business transactions are all dependent on executing a system integration plan 
this plan involves the migration of data across information technology platforms and implementation of new software and hardware 
the domestic systems integration plan was substantially completed in october  while we expect the international systems integration plan to be completed during interest rates rose in the second half of and we expect rates to continue to rise in ultimately  we cannot predict the future levels of interest rates 
until september   interest accrued on the bank of america credit facility borrowings at basis points over applicable libor rates  and at basis points over libor for term loan borrowings 
in accordance with the bank of america credit agreement  our margins ie the interest rate spread above libor increased by basis points in the fourth quarter of based upon certain leverage measurements 
margins increased an additional basis points in the first quarter of based on our leverage ratio as defined in the bank of america credit agreement as of december  and will increase another basis points upon the effective date of the third amendment 
margins on the term borrowings will drop basis points if the balance of the term loan is reduced below million 
given our history of operating losses  along with guidance provided by the accounting literature covering accounting for income taxes  we are unable to conclude it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits of domestic deferred tax assets carried on our books 
therefore  except for our profitable foreign subsidiaries  a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset position was recorded at december  and  and we do not expect to record the benefit of any deferred tax assets that may be generated in we will continue to record current expense associated with federal  foreign and state income taxes 
in  our financial performance benefited from favorable currency translation as the british pound sterling and the canadian dollar strengthened throughout the year against the us dollar 
while we cannot predict the ultimate direction of exchange rates  we do not expect to see the same favorable impact on our financial performance in we expect our working capital levels to remain constant or improve as a percentage of sales as the liquidation of excess inventory in the first half of will be offset by higher levels to support increased sales 
however  inventory carrying values may be impacted by higher material costs 
cash flow will be used in for additional costs related to the consolidation of the abrasives facilities as well as the settlement of previously established restructuring accruals 
the majority of these accruals relate to non cancelable lease obligations for abandoned facilities 
these accruals do not create incremental cash obligations in that we are obligated to make the associated payments whether we occupy the facilities or not 
the amount we will ultimately pay out under these accruals is dependent on our ability to successfully sublet all or a portion of the abandoned facilities 
on march   in anticipation of not achieving the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio or exceeding the maximum consolidated leverage ratio as of the end of the first  second and third quarters of  we obtained the second amendment to the bank of america credit agreement 
the second amendment applied only to the first three quarters of and the covenants would have returned to their original levels for the fourth quarter of specifically  the second amendment eliminated the fixed charge coverage ratio  increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio  established a minimum consolidated ebitda on a latest twelve months basis for each of the periods and also established a minimum availability the eligible collateral base less outstanding borrowings and letters of credit on each day within the nine month period 
subsequent to the second amendment s effective date  we determined that we would likely not meet our amended financial covenants 
on april   we obtained a further amendment to the bank of america credit agreement the third amendment 
the third amendment eliminates the maximum consolidated leverage ratio and the minimum consolidated ebitda as established by the second amendment and adjusts the minimum availability such that our eligible collateral must exceed the sum of our outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under the revolving credit facility by at least million from the effective date of the third amendment through september  and by at least million from september  until the date we deliver our financial statements for the first quarter of to our lenders 
subsequent to the delivery of the financial statements for the first quarter of  the third amendment reestablishes the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as originally set forth in the bank of america credit agreement 
the third amendment also reduces the maximum allowable capital expenditures for from million to million  and increases the interest rate margins on all of our outstanding borrowings and letters of credit to the largest margins set forth in the bank of america credit agreement 
interest rate margins will return to levels set forth in the bank of america credit agreement subsequent to the delivery of our financial statements for the first quarter of to our lenders 
if we are unable to comply with the terms of the amended covenants  we could seek to obtain further amendments and pursue increased liquidity through additional debt financing and or the sale of assets 
we believe that given our strong working capital base  additional liquidity could be obtained through additional debt financing  if necessary 
however  there is no guarantee that such financing could be obtained 
in addition  we are continually evaluating alternatives relating to the sale of excess assets and divestitures of certain of our business units 
asset sales and business divestitures present opportunities to provide additional liquidity by de leveraging our financial position 
cautionary statement pursuant to safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of this report and the information incorporated by reference in this report contain various forward looking statements as defined in section a of the securities act of and section e of the exchange act of  as amended 
the forward looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management  as well as assumptions made by  and information currently available to  our management 
we have based these forward looking statements on current expectations and projections about future events and trends affecting the financial condition of our business 
these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may lead to results that differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made by us or on our behalf  including  among other things increases in the cost of  or in some cases continuation of  the current price levels of plastic resins  copper  paper board packaging  and other raw materials 
our inability to reduce product costs  including manufacturing  sourcing  freight  and other product costs 
greater reliance on third parties for our finished goods as we increase the portion of our manufacturing that is outsourced 
our inability to reduce administrative costs through consolidation of functions and systems improvements 
our inability to execute our systems integration plan 
our inability to successfully integrate our operations as a result of the facility consolidations 
our inability to sub lease rented facilities which have been abandoned as a result of consolidation and restructuring initiatives 
our inability to achieve product price increases  especially as they relate to potentially higher raw material costs 
the potential impact of losing lines of business at large mass merchant retailers in the discount and do it yourself markets 
competition from foreign competitors 
the potential impact of rising interest rates on our libor based bank of america credit agreement 
our inability to meet covenants associated with the bank of america credit agreement 
the potential impact of rising costs for insurance for properties and various forms of liabilities 
the potential impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our foreign operations 
labor issues  including union activities that require an increase in production costs or lead to a strike  thus impairing production and decreasing sales 
we are also subject to labor relations issues at entities involved in our supply chain  including both suppliers and those involved in transportation and shipping 
changes in significant laws and government regulations affecting environmental compliance and income taxes 
words and phrases such as expects  estimates  will  intends  plans  believes  anticipates and the like are intended to identify forward looking statements 
the results referred to in forward looking statements may differ materially from actual results because they involve estimates  assumptions and uncertainties 
forward looking statements included herein are as of the date hereof and we undertake no obligation to revise or update such statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
all forward looking statements should be viewed with caution 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements of katy included in part ii  item certain of our accounting policies as discussed below require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating amounts to record in our financial statements 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized for all sales  including sales to agents and distributors  at the time the products are shipped and title has transferred to the customer  provided that a purchase order has been received or a contract has been executed  there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptances  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection is deemed probable 
the company s standard shipping terms are fob shipping point 
sales discounts  returns and allowances  and cooperative advertising are included in net sales  and the provision for doubtful accounts is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
stock based compensation the company follows the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  regarding accounting for stock options and other stock awards 
apb opinion no 
dictates a measurement date concept in the determination of compensation expense related to stock awards including stock options  restricted stock  and stock appreciation rights 
katy s outstanding stock options all have established measurement dates and therefore  fixed plan accounting is applied  generally resulting in no compensation expense for stock option awards 
however  the company has issued stock appreciation rights  stock awards and restricted stock awards which are accounted for as variable stock compensation awards and compensation expense has been recorded for these awards 
compensation expense for stock awards and stock appreciation rights is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payment from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provision established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of large sized customers  especially our consumer retail customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on our ability to collect our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
our accounting policies state that operating divisions are to identify  at a minimum  those inventory items that are in excess of either one year s historical or one year s forecasted usage  and to use business judgment in determining which is the more appropriate metric 
those inventory items must then be evaluated on a lower of cost or market basis for realization 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or product developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were million and million  respectively  as of december  and goodwill and impairments of long lived assets in connection with certain acquisitions  we recorded goodwill representing the cost of the acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  the fair value of each reporting unit that carries goodwill is determined annually  and the fair value is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  then no adjustment is necessary 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  appraisals are performed of long lived assets and other adjustments are made to arrive at a revised fair value balance sheet 
this revised fair value balance sheet without goodwill is compared to the fair value of the business previously determined  and a revised goodwill amount is reached 
if the indicated goodwill amount meets or exceeds the current carrying value of goodwill  then no adjustment is required 
however  if the result indicates a reduced level of goodwill  an impairment is recorded to state the goodwill at the revised level 
any future impairments of goodwill determined in accordance with sfas no 
would be recorded as a component of income from continuing operations 
we review our long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever triggering events indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
we monitor our operations to look for triggering events that may cause us to perform an impairment analysis 
these events include  among others  loss of product lines  poor operating performance and abandonment of facilities 
we determine the lowest level at which cash flows are separately identifiable to perform the future cash flows tests  and apply the results to the assets related to those separately identifiable cash flows 
in some cases  this may be at the individual asset level  but in other cases  it is more appropriate to perform this testing at a business unit level especially when poor operating performance was the triggering event 
for assets that are to be held and used  we compare undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset or asset group and determine if the carrying value of the asset asset group will be recovered by those cash flows over the remaining useful life of the asset or of the primary asset of an asset group 
if the future undiscounted cash flows indicate that the carrying value of the asset asset group will not be recovered  then the asset is marked to fair value 
for assets that are to be disposed of by sale or by a means other than by sale  the identified asset or disposal group if a group of assets or entire business unit is marked to fair value less costs to sell 
in the case of the planned sale of a business unit  sfas no 
indicates that disposal groups should be reported as discontinued operations on the consolidated financial statements if cash flows of the disposal group are separately identifiable 
sfas no 
has had an impact on the application of accounting for discontinued operations  making it in general much easier to classify a business unit disposal group held for sale as a discontinued operation 
the rules covering discontinued operations prior to sfas no 
generally required that an entire segment of a business be planned for disposal in order to classify it as a discontinued operation 
we recorded impairments of long lived assets during   and in accordance with sfas no 
 which are discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item we also recorded amounts as discontinued operations in and for all periods presented  which are detailed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred income taxes we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred income tax assets also include federal  state and foreign net operating loss carry forwards  primarily due to the significant operating losses incurred during recent years  as well as various tax credits 
we regularly review our deferred income tax assets for recoverability taking into consideration historical net income losses  projected future income losses and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
we establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that these assets will not be recovered 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance of million 
during the year ended december   we increased the valuation allowance by million primarily to provide a full reserve against our net deferred tax asset position 
except for certain of our foreign subsidiaries  given the negative evidence provided by our history of operating losses  and considering guidance provided by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we were unable to conclude that it is more likely that not that our deferred tax assets would be recoverable through the generation of future taxable income 
we will continue to evaluate our valuation allowance requirements based on future operating results and business acquisitions and dispositions  and we may adjust our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
such changes in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be reflected in current operations through our income tax provision 
workers compensation and product liabilities we make payments for workers compensation and product liability claims generally through the use of a third party claims administrator 
we have purchased insurance coverage for large claims over our self insured retention levels 
our workers compensation and health benefit liabilities are developed using actuarial methods based upon historical data for payment patterns  cost trends  and other relevant factors 
in order to consider a range of possible outcomes  we have based our estimates of liabilities in this area on several different sources of loss development factors  including those from the insurance industry  the manufacturing industry  and factors developed in house 
our general approach is to identify a reasonable  logical conclusion  typically in the middle range of the possible outcomes 
while we believe that our liabilities for workers compensation and product liability claims as of december  are adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such estimated liabilities could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
environmental and other contingencies we and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors  subsidiaries and divisions are involved in remedial activities at certain present and former locations and have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency  state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties prps at a number of hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act superfund or equivalent state laws and  as such  may be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at these sites 
responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 
under the federal superfund statute  parties could be held jointly and severally liable  thus subjecting them to potential individual liability for the entire cost of cleanup at the site 
based on our estimate of allocation of liability among prps  the probability that other prps  many of whom are large  solvent  public companies  will fully pay the costs apportioned to them  currently available information concerning the scope of contamination  estimated remediation costs  estimated legal fees and other factors  we have recorded and accrued for environmental liabilities in amounts that we deem reasonable 
the ultimate costs will depend on a number of factors and the amount currently accrued represents our best current estimate of the total costs to be incurred 
we expect this amount to be substantially paid over the next one to four years 
see item legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii 
item severance  restructuring and related charges since the recapitalization in mid  we have initiated several cost reduction and facility consolidation initiatives including the closure or consolidation of manufacturing  distribution and office facilities the centralization of business units and the outsourcing of our electrical products manufacturing to asia 
these initiatives have resulted in significant severance  restructuring and related charges over the past three and one half years 
included in these charges are one time termination benefits including severance  benefits and other employee related costs associated with employee terminations  contract termination costs mostly related to non cancelable lease liabilities for abandoned facilities  net of sublease revenue  and other costs associated with the moving of inventory  machinery and equipment  consolidation of administrative and operational functions and consultants working on sourcing and other manufacturing and production efficiency initiatives 
we expect to substantially complete our restructuring program in in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we recognize costs including costs for one time termination benefits associated with exit or disposal activities as they are incurred 
however  charges related to non cancelable leases require estimates of sublease income and adjustments to these liabilities are possible in the future depending on the accuracy of the sublease assumptions made

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments relating to this exposure 
our interest obligations on outstanding debt at december  were indexed from short term libor london inter bank offered rates 
we do not believe our exposures to interest rate risks are material to our financial position or results of operations 
the following table presents as of december   our financial instruments  rates of interest and indications of fair value expected maturity dates amounts in thousands assets thereafter total fair value temporary cash investments fixed rate average interest rate indebtedness fixed rate debt average interest rate variable interest rate        average interest rate foreign exchange risk we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro  british pound  canadian dollar and various asian currencies such as the chinese renminbi 
some of our subsidiaries make significant us dollar purchases from asian suppliers  particularly in china  taiwan and the philippines 
an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates of asian countries could result in an increase in the cost of purchases 
we do not currently hedge foreign currency transaction or translation exposures 
our net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into us dollars at december  is million 
a change in foreign currency exchange rates would amount to million change in our net investment in foreign subsidiaries at december  commodity price risk we have not employed an active hedging program related to our commodity price risk  but are employing other strategies for managing this risk  including contracting for a certain percentage of resin needs through supply agreements and opportunistic spot purchases
