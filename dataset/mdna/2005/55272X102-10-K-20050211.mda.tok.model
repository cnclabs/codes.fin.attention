general mfa mortgage investments  inc  a self advised mortgage reit  is primarily engaged in the business of investing  on a leveraged basis  in arm mbs 
the company s mbs portfolio consists primarily of agency mbs and  to a lesser extent  high quality arm mbs  rated in one of the two highest rating categories by at least one of the rating agencies 
the company s operating policies also permit investments in residential mortgage loans  residential mbs  direct or indirect investments in multi family apartment properties  investments in limited partnerships  reits or closed end funds and investments in other corporate or government fixed income instruments 
the company s principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to its stockholders  resulting from the spread between the interest and other income it earns on its investments and the cost of financing such investments 
the company has elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
pursuant to the current federal tax regulations  one of the requirements of maintaining its status as a reit is that the company must distribute at least of its annual taxable net income to its stockholders  subject to certain adjustments 
the company has  over time  significantly increased its asset base by investing  on a leveraged basis  additional equity capital raised through public offerings and other issuances of common stock and preferred stock 
as a result  the company has experienced significant growth in assets and earnings 
the company s total assets were billion at december   compared to billion at december  at december   of the company s assets consisted of agency mbs  aaa rated mbs  mbs related receivables and cash 
at december   the company also had indirect interests in three multi family apartment properties  containing a total of rental units  located in georgia  north carolina and nebraska and million of non agency mbs rated below aaa 
the results of the company s operations are affected by various factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company and primarily depend on  among other things  the level of the company s net interest income  the market value of its assets and the supply of  and demand for  mbs assets 
the company s net interest income varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates  the slope of the yield curve  borrowing costs and prepayment speeds on the company s mbs portfolio  the behavior of which involves various risks and uncertainties 
interest rates and prepayment speeds  as measured by the cpr  vary according to the type of investment  conditions in financial markets  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
for the company  increases in interest rates  in general  may over time cause i the cost of borrowings to increase  ii the value of the company s mbs portfolio and stockholders equity to decline  iii prepayments on the mbs portfolio to slow  thereby reducing the cost of premium amortization  and iv coupons on the mbs assets to reset to higher interest rates 
conversely  decreases in interest rates  in general  may over time cause i prepayments on the mbs portfolio to increase  thereby increasing the cost of premium amortization  ii coupons on the mbs assets to reset to lower interest rates  iii the cost of borrowings to decrease  and iv the value of the mbs portfolio and stockholders equity to increase 
in addition  borrowing costs are further affected by the company s creditworthiness 
the company expects that recent and anticipated increases in market interest rates will cause the cost of its borrowings to continue to increase more rapidly than the yield on its mbs portfolio  which will lead to a narrowing of spreads earned by the company during the operating results of the company depend  to a great extent  upon its ability to effectively manage its interest rate and prepayment risks while maintaining its status as a reit 
the company also has risks inherent in its other assets  comprised primarily of interests in multi family apartment properties  non agency mbs rated below aaa and derivative financial instruments 
although these assets represent a small portion of the company s total assets  less than of the company s total assets at december   they have the potential of materially impacting the company s operating performance in future periods

the company continues to explore alternative business strategies  investments and financing sources and other strategic initiatives  including  without limitation  the acquisition and securitization of arms and the expansion of third party advisory services  to complement the company s core business strategy of investing  on a leveraged basis  in high quality arm mbs 
no assurance  however  can be provided that any such strategic initiatives will or will not be implemented in the future or  if undertaken  that any such strategic initiatives will favorably impact the company

the sox act  which was enacted during  among other things  places additional responsibilities on management and the boards of directors of public companies 
the company has and continues to incur incremental costs associated with complying with the provisions of the sox act and other related changes to federal securities and corporate governance laws

during  the company incurred approximately  in fees related to sox act compliance initiatives 
critical accounting policies management has the obligation to insure that its policies and methodologies are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
during  management reviewed and evaluated its critical accounting policies and believes them to be appropriate 
the company s accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and all majority owned and controlled subsidiaries 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgements of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the company does not believe that there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgement and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the company s accounting policies are described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  included under item management believes the more significant of these to be as follows classifications of investment securities and valuations of such securities the company s investments in mbs are classified as available for sale securities  as discussed in note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  included under item although all of the company s mbs are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value  the classification of the securities as available for sale results in changes in estimated fair value being recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which is a component of stockholders equity  rather than through earnings 
the company does not intend to hold any its securities for trading purposes  however  if available for sale securities were classified as trading securities  there could be substantially greater volatility in the company s earnings 
as noted above  all of the company s mbs are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value 
the estimated fair values of such assets are based on prices obtained from a third party pricing service  if pricing is not available for an mbs from such pricing service  the average of broker quotes received for such mbs is used to determine the estimated fair value of such mbs 
given that such securities trade in an active market  the company believes that the fair market values presented accurately reflect the estimated fair market value of the mbs at the time of valuation 
when the estimated fair value of an available for sale security is less than amortized cost  management considers whether there is an other than temporary impairment in the value of the security 
if  in management s judgment  an other than temporary impairment exists  the cost basis of the security is written down to the then current estimated fair value  with the amount of impairment charged to current earnings 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process  and different judgments and assumptions could affect the timing of loss realization 
see note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  included under item interest income recognition interest income on the company s mbs is accrued based on the actual coupon rate and the outstanding principal balance of such securities 
premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into interest income over the lives of the securities using the effective yield method  as adjusted for actual prepayments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
derivative financial instruments and hedging activities the company applies the provisions of fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  fas as amended by fas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
in accordance with fas  a derivative  which is designated as a hedge  is recognized as an asset liability and measured at estimated fair value 
to qualify for hedge accounting  at inception of the cap  the company must anticipate that the hedge will be highly effective in limiting the company s cost beyond the cap threshold on its matching on an aggregate basis anticipated repurchase agreements during the active period of the cap 
as long as the hedge remains effective  changes in estimated fair value are included in the accumulated other comprehensive income portion of stockholders equity 
upon the cap agreement active period commencing  the premium paid to enter into the cap agreement is amortized and reflected in interest expense 
the periodic amortization of the premium expense is based on an estimated allocation of the premium  determined at inception of the hedge based on the original purchase price 
payments received in connection with the cap agreement will be reported a reduction to interest expense  net of the amortization recognized for the premium 
if it is determined that a cap agreement is not effective  the premium would be reduced and a corresponding charge made to interest expense  for the ineffective portion of the cap agreement 
the maximum cost related to the company s cap agreements is limited to the original purchase price of the derivative 
in order to limit credit risk associated with cap agreements  the company s current policy is to only purchase caps from financial institutions rated single a or better by one of the rating agencies 
income generated by the company s caps  if any  would offset interest expense on the hedged liabilities 
in order to continue to qualify for and to apply hedge accounting  cap agreements are monitored on a quarterly basis to determine whether they continue to be effective or  if prior to the commencement of the active period  whether the cap expects to continue to be effective 
if during the term of the cap agreement the company determines that a cap is not effective or that a cap is not expected to be effective  the ineffective portion of the cap will no longer qualify for hedge accounting and  accordingly  subsequent changes in its estimated fair value will be reflected in earnings 
at december   the company had cap agreements  with an aggregate notional amount of million 
there were unrealized losses of million on the company s cap agreements 
see notes j and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  included under item impairment of long lived assets real estate investments held directly or through joint ventures represent long lived assets for accounting purposes 
the company periodically reviews long lived assets to be held and used in operations for impairment in value whenever any events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
in management s opinion  based on this analysis  real estate and investments in joint ventures are considered to be held for investment and are not carried at amounts in excess of their estimated fair value 
income taxes the company s financial results generally do not reflect provisions for current or deferred income taxes 
management believes that the company has and intends to continue to operate in a manner that will continue to allow it to be taxed as a reit and as a result does not expect to pay substantial corporate level taxes 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
if the company were to fail to meet the reit requirements  the company would be subject to federal  state and local income taxes 
accounting for stock based compensation on january   the company adopted fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by fas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  fas 
the adoption of fas did not have an impact on the company as all outstanding options were fully vested at the time fas was adopted 
however  the company recorded an expense of  and  for and  respectively  related to its stock options and related ders granted subsequent to january  the future effect of fas will be based on  among other things  the underlying terms of any future grants of stock based compensation 
estimating the fair value of stock options requires that assumptions are made  which are subjective 
see note a to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  included under item liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of liquidity consist of borrowings under repurchase agreements  principal payments received on its portfolio of mbs  cash flows generated by operations and proceeds from capital market transactions 
the company s most significant uses of cash include purchases of mbs and dividend payments on its capital stock 
in addition  the company also uses cash to fund operations  enter into hedging instruments and make such other investments that it considers appropriate 
borrowings under repurchase agreements increased by billion to billion at december   from billion at december  this increase in borrowings was facilitated by the increase in the company s equity capital as a result of the issuance of common stock and preferred stock during at december   repurchase agreements had a weighted average borrowing rate of  on loan balances of between  and million 
these repurchase agreements generally have original terms to maturity ranging from one to months at inception of the loan and fixed interest rates that are typically based off of libor 
to date  the company has not had any margin calls on its repurchase agreements that it was unable to satisfy with either cash or additional pledged collateral 
during the year ended december   principal payments on mbs generated cash of billion and operations provided million in cash 
as part of its core investing activities  during  the company purchased billion of mbs  of which billion were either agency mbs or aaa rated arm mbs 
during the year ended december   the company paid dividends on its outstanding common stock and preferred stock totaling million 
on december   the company declared dividends on it common stock totaling million  which will be paid on january  to stockholders of record on december  while the company generally intends to hold its mbs as long term investments  certain mbs may be sold as part of managing the company s interest rate risk  liquidity needs and other operating objectives 
as such  all of the company s mbs are designated as available for sale 
the timing and impact of future sales of mbs  if any  cannot be predicted with any certainty 
during the year ended december   the company sold three mbs with an aggregate amortized cost of million  realizing net gains of  and generating cash proceeds of million 
the company does not intend for its mbs portfolio  or any portion thereof  to be held for trading purposes 
the company employs a diverse capital raising strategy involving the issuance of both common stock and preferred stock 
during the year ended december   the company issued i approximately million shares of common stock through a public offering raising net proceeds of million  ii approximately million shares of preferred stock through two public offerings raising net proceeds of million  iii approximately million shares of common stock pursuant to the drspp raising net proceeds of million  and iv approximately million shares of common stock pursuant to the ceo program raising net proceeds of million 
in the aggregate  the company raised net proceeds of million through capital market transactions during during the year ended december   the company completed one public offering of its common stock and two public offerings of its preferred stock 
the company s public equity offerings were as follows settlement date securities sold number of shares price per share gross proceeds offering expenses net proceeds in thousands  except share and per share amounts february  common stock     february  common stock    april  preferred stock    october  preferred stock    represents the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option in full for the equity transaction settled on february  at december   the company had an aggregate of million available under its two effective shelf registration statements on form s the company may  as market conditions permit  issue additional shares of common stock and or preferred stock pursuant to these registration statements 
on december   the company filed a new shelf registration statement on form s with the sec under the act for the purpose of registering additional common stock for sale through the drspp 
this new shelf registration statement was declared effective by the sec on january  and  when combined with the unused portion of the company s previous drspp shelf registration statement  registered an aggregate of million shares of common stock 
to the extent the company raises additional equity capital from future capital market transactions  the company currently anticipates using the net proceeds for general corporate purposes  including  without limitation  the acquisition of additional mbs consistent with its operating policies and the repayment of its repurchase agreements 
the company may also consider acquiring additional interests in residential arms  multi family apartment properties and or other investments consistent with its investment strategies and operating policies 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to raise additional equity capital at any particular time or on any particular terms 
in order to reduce interest rate risk exposure  the company may enter into caps and swaps  which are designated as cash flow hedges against the company s current and anticipated day libor term repurchase agreements 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
during the year ended december   the company purchased caps with a notional amount of million at a cost of million  entered into million notional amount of fixed rate pay swaps  and had million of caps that expired 
the company s caps  which had an aggregate notional amount of million at december   will generate future cash payments to the company if interest rates were to increase beyond the rate specified in any of the individual cap agreements 
to date  the company has not received any payments related to its cap agreements  as the benchmark interest rate on each of the company s active cap agreements has remained below such cap agreements strike rate 
at december   the company s swaps require the company to pay a weighted average fixed rate of on million from december  through september  and receive a variable rate based on day libor 
under its repurchase agreements  the company may be required to pledge additional assets to its repurchase agreement counterparties ie  lenders in the event the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders demand additional collateral a margin call  which may take the form of additional securities or cash 
specifically  margin calls result from a decline in the value of the company s mbs collateralizing its repurchase agreements  generally due to principal reduction of such mbs from scheduled amortization and prepayments on the mortgages securing such mbs and to changes in the estimated fair value of such mbs resulting from changes in market interest rates and other market factors 
from time to time  the company may have restricted cash which represents cash held on deposit as collateral with lenders and  at the time a repurchase agreement rolls ie  matures  generally will be applied against the repurchase agreement  thereby reducing the borrowing 
the company believes it has adequate financial resources to meet its obligations as they come due  including margin calls  and to fund dividends declared as well as to actively pursue its investment strategies 
through december   the company did not have any margin calls on its repurchase agreements that it was not able to satisfy with either cash or additional pledged collateral 
however  should market interest rates and or prepayment speeds on the mortgages underlying the company s mbs suddenly increase  margin calls on the company s repurchase agreements could result  causing an adverse change in the company s liquidity position 
the following table summarizes the effect on the company s liquidity and cash flows from contractual obligations for repurchase agreements  non cancelable office leases and mortgages held by the company s real estate subsidiaries at december  thereafter in thousands repurchase agreements mortgage loans long term lease obligations inflation substantially all of the company s assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates and other factors impact the company s performance far more than does inflation 
the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and dividends are based upon net income as calculated for tax purposes  in each case  the company s results of operations and reported assets  liabilities and equity are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation 
other matters the company intends to conduct its business so as to maintain its exempt status under  and not to become regulated as an investment company for purposes of  the investment company act 
if the company were to fail to maintain its exempt status under the investment company act and become regulated as an investment company  the company s ability to  among other things  use leverage would be substantially reduced and  as a result  the company would be unable to conduct its business as described in this annual report on form k 
the investment company act exempts entities that are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate qualifying interests 
under the current interpretation of the staff of the sec  in order to qualify for this exemption  the company must maintain at least of its assets directly in qualifying interests the test 
mbs that do not represent all of the certificates issued ie  an undivided interest with respect to the entire pool of mortgages ie  a whole pool underlying such mbs may be treated as securities separate from such underlying mortgage loans and  thus  may not be considered qualifying interests for purposes of the test 
therefore  the company s ownership of these types of mbs is limited by the provisions of the investment company act 
in meeting the test  the company treats as qualifying interests those mbs issued with respect to an underlying pool as to which it owns all of the issued certificates 
if the sec or its staff were to adopt a contrary interpretation  the company could be required to sell a substantial amount of its mbs under potentially adverse market conditions 
further  in order to insure that it at all times qualifies for this exemption from the investment company act  the company may be precluded from acquiring mbs whose yield is higher than the yield on mbs that could be otherwise purchased in a manner consistent with this exemption 
accordingly  the company monitors its compliance with the test in order to maintain its exempt status under the investment company act 
as of december   the company had determined that it was in and had maintained compliance with the test

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company seeks to manage the interest rate  market value  liquidity  prepayment and credit risks inherent in all financial institutions in a prudent manner designed to insure the longevity of the company while  at the same time  seeking to provide an opportunity to stockholders to realize attractive total rates of return through stock ownership of the company 
while the company does not seek to avoid risk  it does seek to assume risk that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage such risk  to earn sufficient returns to justify the taking of such risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks that it does undertake 
interest rate risk the company primarily invests in arm mbs 
the company expects that over time its arm mbs will experience higher prepayment rates than would fixed rate mbs 
this is based on the assumption that homeowners with adjustable rate and hybrid mortgages are generally self selected borrowers and are expected to exhibit more rapid housing turnover levels or refinancing activity compared to fixed rate borrowers 
in addition  the company believes that prepayments on arm mbs accelerate significantly as the coupon reset date approaches 
over the last two years  on a quarterly basis  ending with december   the cpr on the company s mbs portfolio ranged from a low of to a high of  with an average quarterly cpr of the company takes into account both anticipated coupon resets and expected prepayments when measuring sensitivity of its arm mbs portfolio to changes in interest rates 
in measuring its assets to borrowings repricing gap the repricing gap  the company measures the difference between a the weighted average months until coupon adjustment or projected prepayment on the arm mbs portfolio  and b the months remaining on its repurchase agreements applying the same projected prepayment rate and including the impact of swaps 
assuming a cpr  the weighted average term to repricing or assumed prepayment for the company s arm mbs portfolio  as of december   was approximately months and the average term remaining on the company s repurchase agreements  including the impact of swaps  was approximately nine months  resulting in repricing gap of eight months 
assuming prepayment rates were to decline significantly to a prepayment rate as low as cpr  the weighted average term to repricing or assumed prepayment for the company s arm mbs portfolio  as of december   would be extended to approximately months and the average term remaining on the company s repurchase agreements  including the impact of swaps  would remain at approximately eight months  resulting in an extension of the repricing gap to approximately months 
the cpr is applied in order to reflect  to a certain extent  the prepayment characteristics inherent in the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
as of december   based on contractual terms ie  assuming no prepayments  the company s arm mbs portfolio had a weighted average term to repricing of approximately months and its repurchase agreements  including the impact of swaps  had a weighted average term remaining of approximately nine months  resulting in a repricing gap of approximately months 
based on historical results  the company believes that applying a cpr assumption  rather than a cpr assumption  provides a more realistic approximation of the repricing gap for the company s arm mbs portfolio over time 
the company s debt obligations are generally repurchase agreements with remaining terms of two years or less 
upon contractual maturity or an interest reset date  these borrowings are refinanced at then prevailing market rates 
the interest rates for most of the company s adjustable rate assets are primarily dependent on the one year cmt rate or libor  while its debt obligations  in the form of repurchase agreements  are generally priced off of libor 
while libor and cmt generally move together  there can be no assurance that such movements will be parallel  such that the magnitude of the movement of one index will match that of the other index 
at december   the company had of its arm mbs portfolio repricing from the one year cmt index  repricing from the one year libor index  repricing from cofi and repricing from the month cmt moving average 
the company s adjustable rate assets reset on various dates that are not matched to the reset dates on the company s borrowings ie  repurchase agreements 
in general  the repricing of the company s debt obligations occurs more quickly than the repricing of its assets 
therefore  on average  the company s cost of borrowings may rise or fall more quickly in response to changes in market interest rates than does the yield on its interest earning assets 
the mismatch between repricings or maturities within a time period is commonly referred to as the gap for that period 
a positive gap  where repricing of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the maturity of interest rate sensitive liabilities  generally will result in the net interest margin increasing in a rising interest rate environment and decreasing in a falling interest rate environment 
at december   the company had a negative gap  which will generally have the opposite results on the net interest margin 
as discussed above  the gap analysis is prepared assuming cprs of and  however  actual prepayment speeds could vary significantly such assumptions 
the gap analysis does not reflect the constraints on the repricing of arm mbs in a given period resulting from interim and lifetime cap features on these securities  or the behavior of various indexes applicable to the company s assets and liabilities 
the gap methodology does not assess the relative sensitivity of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates and also fails to account for interest rate caps and floors imbedded in the company s mbs or include assets and liabilities that are not interest rate sensitive 
the following table sets forth the company s interest rate risk using the gap methodology applying a cpr at december  at december  less than months three months to one year one year to two years two years to three years beyond three years total interest earning assets adjustable rate mbs fixed rate mbs cash total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities repurchase agreements mortgage loans total interest bearing liabilities gap before hedging instruments notional amounts of swaps cumulative difference between interest earnings assets and interest bearing liabilities after derivatives the following table sets forth the company s interest rate risk using the gap methodology applying a cpr  the cpr at which the company s asset liability mismatch limits are based  at december  at december  less than months three months to one year one year to two years two years to three years beyond three years total interest earning assets adjustable rate mbs fixed rate mbs cash total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities repurchase agreements mortgage loans total interest bearing liabilities gap before hedging instruments notional amounts of swaps cumulative difference between interest earnings assets and interest bearing liabilities after derivatives as part of its overall interest rate risk management strategy  the company periodically uses hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by interest rate volatility 
the interest rate risk management strategy at times involves modifying the repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities utilizing derivatives 
at december   the company had caps with an aggregate notional amount of million  of which were active  and swaps with a notional amount of million  all of which are active 
to date  the company has not received any payments under any of its hedging instruments 
the notional amount of the swap is presented in the table above  as it impacts the cost of a portion of the company s repurchase agreements 
the notional amounts of the company s caps  which hedge against increases in interest rates on the company s libor based repurchase agreements  are not considered in the gap analysis  as they do not effect the timing of the repricing of the instruments they hedge  but rather  to the extent of the notional amount  cap the limit on the amount of interest rate change that can occur relative to the hedged liability 
in addition  the notional amounts of the company s hedging instruments are not reflected in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition 
the company s caps  at the time of purchase  are intended to serve as a hedge against future interest rate increases on the company s repurchase agreements  which are typically priced off of libor 
market value risk substantially all of the company s mbs are designated as available for sale assets 
as such  they are reflected at their estimated fair value  with the difference between amortized cost and estimated fair value reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  included under item the estimated fair value of the company s mbs fluctuate primarily due to changes in interest rates and other factors  however  given that  at december   these securities were primarily agency mbs or aaa rated mbs  such changes in the estimated fair value of the company s mbs are generally not credit related 
to a limited extent the company is exposed to credit related market value risk as the company at  december   held million of non agency mbs that were rated below aaa  of which  were non rated securities 
generally  in a rising interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of the company s mbs would be expected to decrease  conversely  in a decreasing interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of such mbs would be expected to increase 
if the estimated fair value of the company s mbs collateralizing its repurchase agreements decreases  the company may receive margin calls from its repurchase agreement counterparties for additional collateral or cash due to such decline 
if such margin calls were not met  the lender could liquidate the securities collateralizing the company s repurchase agreements with such lender  resulting in a loss to the company 
in such a scenario  the company could apply a strategy of reducing borrowings and assets  by selling assets or not replacing securities as they amortize and or prepay  thereby shrinking the balance sheet 
such an action would likely reduce interest income  interest expense and net income  the extent of which would be dependent on the level of reduction in assets and liabilities as well as the sale price of the assets sold 
further  such a decrease in the company s net interest income could negatively impact cash available for distributions  which in turn could reduce the market price of the company s issued and outstanding common stock and preferred stock 
liquidity risk the primary liquidity risk for the company arises from financing long maturity assets  which have interim and lifetime interest rate adjustment caps  with shorter term borrowings in the form of repurchase agreements 
although the interest rate adjustments of these assets and liabilities are matched within the guidelines established by the company s operating policies  maturities are not required to be nor are they matched 
the company s assets which are pledged to secure repurchase agreements are typically high quality  liquid assets 
as a result  the company has not had difficulty rolling over ie  renewing these agreements as they mature 
however  there can be no assurances that the company will always be able to roll over its repurchase agreements 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and unpledged securities of million available to meet margin calls on its repurchase agreements and for other corporate purposes 
however  should market interest rates and or prepayment speeds on the mortgage loans underlying the company s mbs suddenly increase  margin calls relating to the company s repurchase agreements could increase  causing an adverse change in the company s liquidity position 
prepayment and reinvestment risk as the company receives repayments of principal on its mbs  premiums paid on such securities are amortized against interest income and discounts on mbs are accreted to interest income 
premiums arise when the company acquires a mbs at a price in excess of the principal balance of the mortgages securing such mbs or the par value of such mbs if purchased at the original issue 
conversely  discounts arise when the company acquires a mbs at a price below the principal balance of the mortgages securing such mbs or the par value of such mbs if purchased at the original issue 
for financial accounting purposes interest income is accrued based on the outstanding principal balance of the investment securities and their contractual terms 
purchase premiums on the company s investment securities  currently comprised of mbs  are amortized against interest income over the lives of the securities using the effective yield method  adjusted for actual prepayment activity 
in general  an increase in the prepayment rate  as measured by the cpr  will accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums  thereby reducing the yield interest income earned on such assets 
for tax accounting purposes  the purchase premiums are amortized based on the constant effective yield at the purchase date 
therefore  on a tax basis  amortization of premiums will differ from those reported for financial purposes under gaap 
at december   the gross unamortized premium for arm mbs for financial accounting purposes was million of the carrying value of mbs while the gross unamortized premium for income tax purposes was estimated at million 
in general  the company believes that it will be able to reinvest proceeds from scheduled principal payments and prepayments at acceptable yields  however  no assurances can be given that  should significant prepayments occur  market conditions would be such that acceptable investments could be identified and the proceeds timely reinvested 
tabular presentation the information presented in the following table projects the potential impact of sudden parallel changes in interest rates on net interest income and portfolio value  including the impact of hedging instruments  over the next twelve months based on the assets in the company s investment portfolio on december  the company acquires interest rate sensitive assets and funds them with interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the company generally plans to retain such assets and the associated interest rate risk to maturity 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage change from the projected net interest income and portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario 
change in interest rates percentage change in net interest income percentage change in portfolio value certain assumptions have been made in connection with the calculation of the information set forth in the above table and  as such  there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur or that other events will not occur that would affect the outcomes 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  the analysis presented utilizes assumptions and estimates based on management s judgment and experience 
furthermore  future sales  acquisitions and restructuring could materially change the company s interest rate risk profile 
it should be specifically noted that the information set forth in the above table and all related disclosure constitutes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the act and section e of the exchange act 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table 
the table quantifies the potential changes in net interest income and portfolio value should interest rates immediately change shock 
the table presents the estimated impact of interest rates instantaneously rising and basis points  and falling and basis points 
the cash flows associated with the portfolio of mbs for each rate shock are calculated based on assumptions  including  but not limited to  prepayment speeds  yield on future acquisitions  slope of the yield curve and size of the portfolio 
assumptions made on the interest rate sensitive liabilities  which are assumed to be repurchase agreements  include anticipated interest rates  collateral requirements as a percent of the repurchase agreement  amount and term of borrowing 
the impact on portfolio value is approximated using the calculated effective duration ie  the price sensitivity to changes in interest rates of and expected convexity ie  approximates the change in duration relative to the change in interest rates of 
the impact on net interest income is driven mainly by the difference between portfolio yield and cost of funding of the company s repurchase agreements  which includes the cost and or benefit from hedging instruments that hedge such repurchase agreements 
the company s asset liability structure is generally such that an increase in interest rates would be expected to result in a decrease in net interest income  as the company s repurchase agreements are generally shorter term than the company s interest earning assets 
when interest rates are shocked  prepayment assumptions are adjusted based on management s expectations along with the results from the prepayment model 
for example  under current market conditions  a basis point increase in interest rates is estimated to result in a decrease in the cpr of the mbs portfolio
