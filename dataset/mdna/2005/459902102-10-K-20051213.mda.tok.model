mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
throughout this section  table amounts are presented in millions  except units  asp  arpu  ardu  and eps 
our mda is organized into the following sections our business a general description of our business and operating segments our focus a summary of our strategies and opportunities recently issued accounting standards a discussion of recently issued accounting standards with significance to our business critical accounting estimates a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates consolidated operating results a comparative analysis of income from continuing operations for the three fiscal years presented in our consolidated financial statements business segment results a comparative analysis of business segment results for the three fiscal years presented in our consolidated financial statements liquidity and capital resources a year over year comparative analysis of cash flows and capital resources for the three fiscal years presented in our consolidated financial statements financial condition analysis of significant changes in our financial position our business international game technology is a global company specializing in the design  development  manufacturing  distribution and sales of computerized gaming machines and systems products 
we strive to maintain a diverse portfolio of gaming products that span a wide range of categories and target customer markets with a variety of games  platforms and systems offered across gaming jurisdictions worldwide 
we had annual revenues of billion in fiscal we derive our revenues in two ways  either from the sale product sales or placement gaming operations of our gaming products  services and or intellectual property 
operating results reviewed by our chief decision makers encompass all revenue sources within each geographical customer region 
we currently view our business segments in two primary operating divisions  each incorporating all types of revenues the north america division  encompasses our operations in the us and canada  including the igt systems group the international division oversees our efforts abroad in asia  australia  new zealand  europe  japan  latin america  russia  south africa  and the uk additionally  our corporate division administers certain unallocated income and expenses related to company wide initiatives 
see the business segment results below and note of our consolidated financial statements for additional segment information and financial results 
our focus product demand demand for our products is driven principally by technological innovations that create new  more sophisticated games and or customer cost savings new or expanding gaming properties establishment or expansion of legalized gaming jurisdictions entertainment value to the player manufacturer s reputation and reliability 
table of contents following several consecutive years of record growth  largely related to the tito replacement cycle  fiscal was a transitional year 
at the end of the current fiscal year  we estimate there were approximately  total machines that remained unconverted in the marketplace 
as we move into fiscal and beyond the number of replacement units that are sold as a direct result of tito are anticipated to further decline 
we expect that future replacement sales will be driven more by customer desire to update their floor with new games and technology  rather than to replace non tito machines 
we anticipate an acceleration of this trend as we transition to sb technology 
offsetting the decline in north america machine demand  we anticipate growing contributions from international operations  as well as increased non machine sales  in part  enabled by our significant share of total gaming devices currently installed on casino floors 
non machine sales include systems  parts  conversions  and royalties or licensing fees 
notwithstanding these factors  we remain dependent upon gaming market expansion for growth 
expansion of new markets has been slower to materialize than we previously expected due to delays in legislative actions and or regulatory approvals 
our business strategies remain focused on the development and expansion of our product offerings capitalizing on new and expanding market opportunities gaining access to important intellectual property strategic acquisitions and alliances to enable development of leading gaming technology ensuring access to new distribution channels product development our business model is the creation of game content and the delivery to consumers via our platforms and systems 
we are a prominent designer of games  platforms and systems for the gaming industry 
we accomplish this by anticipating consumer needs  responding to feedback and marketing trends  and pioneering innovative gaming machines and reliable systems solutions 
our product development efforts are supported by a considerable emphasis and investment in research and development  which we expect will enable us to maintain a leadership position in the industry 
we continue to expand our for sale game library emphasizing development of games to address changing consumer preferences and other market trends 
we strive to develop games that incorporate innovative and entertaining graphics and appealing sound 
we added themes for spinning reel  video poker and incorporated the popular multi line multi coin configuration to our video reels 
fiscal top selling video themes included carnival of mystery multiway alien mystical mermaid we anticipate continued installations into our casino market gaming operations installed base through new video game introductions 
we continually add innovation and enhanced player appeal to our proprietary games 
this includes introducing new multi level progressives games in addition to new games and enhancements to our flagship themes such as wheel of fortune  megabucks  and the price is right 
during fiscal  we introduced and placed new units of fort knox  a multi level mystery progressive penny game video megabucks  a penny game on our avp platform with a million starting jackpot star wars  offered with a million fixed top award in a linked penny progressive configuration demand for these new game themes remains strong and we continue to observe high levels of customer acceptance 
we also maintain our strategy to improve gaming operations revenues by managing the types of games and jurisdictions where games are placed 
to date  we have introduced a number of casino wide integrated products that enhance the players gaming experience and provide operational efficiencies for our customers 
we are now leveraging off this experience and our cds technology to move forward in developing gaming products of the future that incorporate innovative features  including server based gaming 
we continue to make progress with our server based gaming initiatives and have commenced the regulatory approval process and anticipate the start of commercial field trials in the near future 
as the market shifts toward a more system centric gaming environment  we expect a greater portion of our business will come from non machine revenues 

table of contents during the current fiscal year  we entered into a worldwide product integration agreement with pgic and smi to develop a comprehensive  automated table management system known as the its  combining complementary capabilities  technologies  and resources of the three companies 
a well implemented casino management and patron loyalty system offers strategic and competitive value to a casino s slot operations 
we view the extension of this technology into the table games area as the next logical phase in the expansion of these products 
in august  we acquired wagerworks  a provider of internet gaming technology  content and services to capitalize on the expanding internet gaming market 
ww adheres to a strict compliance policy designed to ensure that operators offer the company s products and services to end users in a responsible manner 
we anticipate this business combination will facilitate the distribution of our game content across new channels and mediums  including the internet  mobile devices  and interactive television 
market opportunities we market our gaming products to legalized gaming jurisdictions around the world 
while our most significant markets are in north america  we continue to pursue additional opportunities in international markets 
the opportunities and challenges  and the extent of our successes  vary across these jurisdictions 
we previously estimated that new north america and international markets would materialize during fiscal  but current market dynamics suggest that significant expansion could be delayed until fiscal although the timing has been delayed and remains uncertain  we do expect that opportunities will eventually come from new jurisdictions and expansion of existing markets 
we continue to monitor expanding and emerging markets in north america  including california where the potential for new and renegotiated tribal state compacts could spur further expansion 
we anticipate major expansion of legalized gambling previously forecasted for and early will occur in late and with recent legislative action and voter referendums  we expect to see new markets opening in both florida and pennsylvania in late calendar we also monitor gaming legislation in potential new markets in the states of arkansas  kansas  ohio  maryland  massachusetts and texas all showing interest in some form of legalized gaming 
gaming expansion is ongoing in numerous cds and class ii markets nationwide 
racino markets in maine  new york and rhode island continue to grow 
new york continues to expand their program with anticipated future openings in yonkers and aqueduct scheduled for late fiscal and early fiscal our market share of lease operation machines in new york and rhode island grew in through a reallocation process based on our product performance 
the outlook for international market expansion continues to improve with opportunities in asia  latin america  russia  and the uk 
we are concentrating our management and development resources toward product localization  so we export a us manufactured product customized for local cultures 
with the prospects of new international jurisdictions we anticipate our international markets will continue to grow in significance over the next several years and increase their share of overall contribution 
competition the market for gaming machines and systems is intensely competitive principally through new product development 
we maintain a global competitive advantage because of our ability to offer a dynamic and diverse library of innovative and strong performing games develop and protect our extensive collection of intellectual properties provide the highest levels of customer service and support we also competitively benefit from our financial strength which allows us to aggressively research and develop new products  as well as invest in strategic acquisitions and alliances extensive and well established infrastructure of sales  and manufacturing worldwide recognition and geographic diversity we currently hold a significant share of the total gaming devices on north america casino floors 
within that population  our share in spinning reel and video poker machines remains stable  but we are experiencing increased competitive pressure within the video spinning reel gaming machines business 
we expect to maintain a leading share of the total population of gaming devices installed over the long term  despite quarterly fluctuations that will occur from time to time 

table of contents the marketplace for recurring revenue units is competitive 
we continue to proactively manage our proprietary installed base in order to offer the strongest performing games placed on casino floors 
we expect our ability to develop exciting new themes should enable us to maintain a leading market share 
sales of our igt advantage systems are successfully capturing market share because of its value added technology offerings 
with a number of significant new igt advantage systems contracts  we now have systems relationships with most major gaming operators 
at september   igt slot systems were installed worldwide connecting approximately  machines  versus systems connecting  machines at september   and systems connecting  machines at september  capital deployment we generated substantial operating cash flows in fiscal  which allowed us to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures and business acquisitions  as well as generate returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 
see the liquidity and capital resources section that follows for current share repurchase and dividend activity 
we enter into strategic business acquisitions and alliances as part of our ongoing effort to create shareholder value designed to complement our internal resources 
we consider businesses that offer opportunities to diversify our geographic reach expand our product lines and customer base leverage our technological and manufacturing infrastructure to increase our rates of return in keeping with efforts to diversify and expand  we entered into the following strategic business relationships and acquisitions during fiscal the acquisition of wagerworks  a provider of internet gaming technology  content and services a collaboration with pgic and smi for the development and marketing of an automated table management solution  known as intelligent table system the asset purchase of friendly matrix  with several products that we anticipate will enhance functionality in our igt advantage systems the asset purchase of hi tech  our former distributor and supplier of gaming equipment and services in canada we anticipate these business relationships and acquisitions will facilitate incremental future growth and eventual economies of scale  although they were not material and are not expected to produce near term earnings accretion 
including amortization of intangibles and in process r d  wagerworks reduced diluted eps by approximately in fiscal and is expected to be approximately dilutive in fiscal see note of our consolidated financial statements for additional financial details of the acquisitions 
hurricane impact we suffered damages and losses to our us gulf coast operations in the wake of hurricanes katrina in august and rita in september approximately  gaming operations machines were affected  of which were destroyed or rendered inoperable and  temporarily shut down  in part due to wap monitoring sites disabled for a short time 
at september   of these gaming operations machines remain out of service 
no determination has been made as to the total amount or timing of insurance payments 
we carry comprehensive business interruption and property damage insurance 
we are working closely with our insurance carriers  claims adjustors  and consultants to ascertain the full amount of insurance proceeds due to igt as a result of the damages and losses suffered in the hurricanes 
business interruption insurance recoveries for lost earnings and any property insurance reimbursements over book value will be recorded when realized and all contingencies have been resolved  which may result in future period fluctuations affecting comparability 
recently issued accounting standards with the adoption of sfas r  share based payment  in our quarter ending december   we will recognize share based compensation in our financial statements 
additionally  the sec issued sab  share based payment  providing interpretive guidance on the interaction of sfas r with existing sec guidance 
sab requires the classification of stock compensation expense to the same financial statement line as cash compensation 
we estimate the impact of adopting sfas r will be approximately dilutive to quarterly earnings in fiscal and will impact our cost of product sales and gaming operations  related gross profits and margins  r d  and sg a expenses 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding recently issued accounting standards 

table of contents critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us 
accordingly  we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on our historical experience  contract terms  observance of known trends in our company and the industry as a whole  and information available from other outside sources 
our estimates affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
actual results may differ from initial estimates 
critical accounting estimates require igt s management to make material subjective or complex judgments about matters that are highly uncertain or variable to determine appropriate estimates and assumptions to be used for recording certain financial transactions 
these areas of our accounting estimates are also the most sensitive to change from external factors 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
jackpot liabilities and expenses changes to our estimates for jackpot liabilities and resulting expense primarily relate to variations in the jackpot life cycle  volume of slot play  timing of jackpots won  and market interest rate trends see item a  market risk 
the initial progressive meter liability on a new system is deferred and subsequently amortized to jackpot expense as future contribution revenues are generated from slot play 
current and non current portions of jackpot liabilities  as well as jackpot expense  may also be impacted by changes in our estimates and assumptions regarding the number of future winners who may elect lump sum payout 
our jackpot liabilities totaled million at september  and million at september  jackpot expense totaled million for fiscal and million in fiscal see note of our consolidated financial statements for additional accounting policies related to jackpot liabilities and expense 
intangible assets  including goodwill and prepaid royalties we review goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually  and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or warrant a revision to the estimated remaining useful life  in accordance with the sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
our forecasted future cash flows used to test the recoverability or determine the fair value of intangibles are based on assumptions that are consistent with plans used to manage the underlying business 
factors used in our evaluations of potential impairment and fair value require significant judgments about respective estimated useful lives  risk rates  forecasted growth rates  brand history  expected market growth  competitive environment  market share  future business prospects and success of our products 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of recoverability or fair value 
while we believe that our estimates of future revenues and cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions could materially affect our assessment of useful lives  recoverability and fair values 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  allocation of related goodwill  assignment of corporate shared assets and liabilities to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units using the discounted cash flow method  and compared the implied valuation multiples to a group of guideline public companies under the market approach to test the reasonableness of the discounted cash flow results 
our goodwill and intangible assets totaled billion at september  and billion at september  if the estimated fair value or useful lives of our intangible assets were to decrease  the most significant impact would be an increase to amortization expense and or impairment  thereby decreasing our results of operations 
we recorded no goodwill impairment charges in fiscal years  or we also regularly evaluate the estimated future benefit of prepaid royalties  as well as minimum commitments not yet paid  to determine amounts unlikely to be realized from forecasted sales or placements of our games 
if actual or revised forecasts fall below the initial estimate  then we may need to revise the remaining useful life and or record additional charges 
the carrying value of our prepaid and deferred royalties totaled million at september  and million at september  
table of contents income taxes determination of the appropriate amount and classification of income taxes is dependent on several factors  including estimates of the timing and probability of realization of deferred income taxes and the timing of income tax payments 
we adjust deferred taxes based on the changes in the difference between the book and tax basis of our assets and liabilities  measured by future tax rates we estimate will be applicable when these differences are expected to reverse 
this process involves estimating our current tax position in each federal  state  and foreign jurisdiction  as well as making judgments as to whether our taxable income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recover any deferred tax assets 
we establish a valuation allowance to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction 
the calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize potential tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other jurisdictions based on our estimate of the extent to which additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of liabilities could result in the recognition of a future tax benefit 
if our tax liabilities are understated  a charge to our tax provision would result 
changes in current tax laws  enacted tax rates  geographic mix or the estimated level of annual taxable income could change our valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  which in turn impacts our effective tax rate and tax provision 
our net deferred tax assets totaled million at september  and million at september  our accrued income taxes totaled million at september  and million at september  bad debt expense we analyze historical collection trends  customer concentrations and creditworthiness  economic trends and anticipated changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts for specific and general risks 
changes in our assumptions and estimates could change our estimated provision for bad debt  thereby impacting our operating income 
our allowances for doubtful accounts  notes  and contracts receivable totaled million at september  and million at september  inventory and gaming operations equipment the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons  generally  one year or less 
if we experience a significant unexpected decrease in demand for our products or a higher occurrence of inventory obsolescence because of changes in technology or customer requirements  we could be required to increase our inventory provisions 
inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times versus the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
our inventories totaled million at september  and million at september  we are also required to estimate salvage values and useful lives for our gaming operations equipment 
trends in market demand and technological obsolescence may require us to record additional asset charges  which would have a negative impact on gross profit 
in fiscal  our assessment of estimated salvage values resulted in adjustments due to expected future releases of more advanced cabinet and game designs 
we recorded million or million after tax to cost of gaming operations related to technological obsolescence and salvage value adjustments in fiscal

our consolidated results include record international revenues and shipments as a result of the success of the two japanese pachisuro games released in the current fiscal year and a strong mix of premium products and parts sales in australia 
additionally  a favorable mix of revenues from systems  parts and game theme conversions and increased gaming operations revenues contributed to current year results 
improved international sales demonstrate our geographic diversity and has compensated for the slowing replacement demand in north america 
improved operating cash flows enabled us to continue our capital deployment strategy of returning value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 
in fiscal we declared cash dividends of per share and repurchased million shares 
significant items affecting comparability of income from continuing operations for the fiscal years included the current year salvage value adjustments and technological obsolescence charges of million  after tax the negative impact to earnings from hurricanes katrina and rita consisting of approximately million  after tax  of hurricane related expenses and million  after tax  in lost business activity in fiscal million after tax for severance costs incurred in the current fiscal year associated with several operational reorganization initiatives additional interest income of million after tax in the current year  related to financing fees realized on early loan repayments the prior year loss on early redemption of our senior notes due may totaling million  after tax the prior year income tax provisions reduction of million  primarily due to utilization of foreign income tax credits the additional week in the prior year related to our week fiscal year  primarily affecting gaming operations and operating expenses

future lost earnings will vary depending on the number of machines that remain out of service and the staggered pace of casino property re openings 
no determination has been made as to the total amount or timing of insurance payments 
business interruption insurance recoveries for lost earnings and any property insurance reimbursements over book value will be recorded when realized and all contingencies have been resolved  which may result in future period fluctuations affecting comparability 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the prior year discontinued operations related to certain anchor operations divested subsequent to acquisition 
consolidated product sales in fiscal were and continue to be adversely affected by the slowdown in demand for tito related replacement machines  as well as fewer new marketplace opportunities 
asps declined in the current fiscal year due to a higher mix of japan s pachisuro machines  which carry lower sales prices and gross margins 
additionally  the allocation of fixed costs across lower domestic sales volumes also contributed to the decrease in consolidated gross margins in the current fiscal year 
we estimate our consolidated product sales gross margin will fluctuate between and in fiscal depending on the geographical mix of product sales 
consolidated gaming operations revenues grew in the current fiscal year primarily due to increases in our installed base as well as increased play levels resulting from new game introductions and removal of lower performing units 
gross margin in fiscal was negatively impacted by charges recorded for technical obsolescence  including adjustments to salvage values  of certain gaming operations assets in response to shifting market demand toward newer igt products that incorporate more innovative features 
the decline in ardu in the current year was primarily due to the increase mix of lower yielding cds and class ii lease operations units  partially offset by increased play levels 
additionally  we began the vie consolidations in april  causing the current year to include an additional six months of vie revenues and expenses  but no material impact to gross profit 
we expect our consolidated gaming operations gross margin will fluctuate between and for fiscal  depending on the jurisdictional mix and types of games placed  as well as movements in interest rates and seasonality 
fiscal vs fiscal igt achieved record financial results in fiscal compared to fiscal  posting revenue growth in both product sales and gaming operations 
the increase in worldwide product sales revenues and gross profit in fiscal over fiscal was attributed to higher volumes in both north america and international markets a favorable shift in product mix improved pricing realization contributions from acres of million in revenues and million in gross profit additionally  product sales gross profit and margin improved during fiscal as a result of lower material costs coupled with operational efficiencies in our reno manufacturing facility

payments to winners include both periodic and lump sum payments 
net cash flows related to jackpots represent timing differences between the growth in liabilities for progressive jackpots and the actual payments to the winners during the period 
fluctuations in net cash flows to fund jackpots reflect variations in the timing of the jackpot life cycles  the pattern of winners payment elections  and the volume of slot play across all of our progressive systems games 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for additional information on how we account for jackpot liabilities 
the consolidation of the progressive systems trust vies in iowa and new jersey also contributed to the increased cash flow volumes related to jackpot investments and liabilities in fiscal and cash flows from investing the fluctuation in net investing cash flows in the current year was primarily attributed to prior year proceeds of million from the sale of discontinued oes operations less cash provided from net investment securities proceeds receipt of million in the prior year on the pala note acquired with anchor additional capital expenditures the fluctuation in net investing cash flows in fiscal versus fiscal was primarily related to less available cash in fiscal utilized for investment securities net cash used to acquire acres of million additional capital expenditures receipt of million on the pala note acquired with anchor see note of our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to certain prior period amounts that have been reclassified to be consistent with the presentation used in the current year  specifically with respect to auction rate securities and restricted cash

credit facilities and indebtedness see note of our consolidated financial statements senior credit facility igt entered into a billion senior credit facility credit facility with a syndicate of banks on july   replacing the previous credit facility of million 
the credit facility is structured in two components both with five year maturities a billion revolver  of which million was reserved for letters of credit at the end of the current fiscal year a million term loan  funded on july  in conjunction with the early redemption of our senior notes the interest rates applicable to the credit facility are based on our public credit ratings and debt to capitalization ratio 
initially these rates were set at libor plus basis points bps for both the revolver and the term loan 
a facility fee of bps applies to the entire credit facility 
the effective interest rate on the term loan equaled at september   and reset to on october  financial covenants for the credit facility  as defined in the agreement  include a maximum leverage ratio of and a minimum interest coverage ratio of the credit facility agreement also includes certain restrictions on our ability to incur new indebtedness  issue guarantees  make acquisitions or grant liens on our assets 

table of contents absence of compliance with required covenant ratios would cause an event of default to occur 
if not cured  the default event could cause the entire outstanding borrowings under the credit facility to become immediately due and payable  as well as trigger cross default provisions to other debt issues 
we continue to be in compliance with all applicable covenants at september  we plan to amend and restate our existing billion credit facility with a billion five year credit facility on or before december  the proposed terms also include the right to accept incremental commitments increasing the revolving credit facility by up to million

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use derivative financial instruments to minimize our market risk exposure resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
the primary business objective of our hedging program  as defined in our corporate risk management policy  is to minimize the impact of transaction  remeasurement  and specified economic exposures to our net income and earnings per share 
the counter parties to these instruments are major commercial banks and we believe that losses related to credit risk are remote 
we are not party to leveraged derivatives and do not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative purposes 
foreign currency risk we routinely use forward exchange contracts to hedge our net exposures  by currency  related to our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional foreign currency of our operations 
in addition  from time to time  we may enter into forward exchange contracts to establish with certainty the us dollar amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency 
hedging at september   our net foreign currency exposure of million related to our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currency was hedged with million in forward currency contracts 
our net foreign currency exposure of million relative to our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currency was hedged with million in forward contracts at september  given our foreign exchange position  a adverse change in foreign exchange rates upon which these foreign exchange contracts are based would result in exchange gains and losses 
in all material aspects  these exchange gains and losses would be fully offset by exchange gains and losses on the underlying net monetary exposures for which the contracts are designated as hedges 
we do not expect material exchange rate gains and losses from unhedged foreign currency exposures 
translation as currency rates change  translation of our foreign currency functional businesses into us dollars affects year over year comparability of equity 
we do not generally hedge translation risks because cash flows from our international operations are generally reinvested locally 
changes in the currency exchange rates that would have the largest impact on translating our international net assets included the australian dollar  the british pound  the japanese yen and the euro 
we estimate that a change in foreign exchange rates would have impacted reported equity by approximately million at september  versus million at september  this increase is largely related to the acquisition of wagerworks  inc this sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one area may or may not be offset by losses from another area 
interest rate risk we estimate interest rate risk as the potential change in the fair value of our debt or earnings resulting from a hypothetical bps adverse change in interest rates 
costs to fund jackpot liabilities fluctuations in prime  treasury and agency rates due to changes in market and other economic conditions directly impact our costs to fund jackpots  and therefore our gross profit in gaming operations 
if interest rates decline  our costs increase  and correspondingly our gross profit declines 
we estimate that a hypothetical decline of bps in interest rates would have reduced our gross profit by approximately million in fiscal year and million in fiscal we do not currently manage this exposure with derivative financial instruments 
convertible debentures price risk the fair value of our debentures is sensitive to changes in both our stock price and interest rates 
assuming interest rates are held constant  we estimate a decrease in our stock price would have decreased the fair value of our convertible debentures by approximately million at september  assuming a constant stock price  we estimate a bps increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our convertible debentures by million at september  see note of our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding certain put and call rights that will become effective of january
