management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
estimates are based on historical experience  when available  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that of its significant accounting policies see 
note to the consolidated financial statements  an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable 
the company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends 
if actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management  additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary  which could unfavorably affect future operating results 
inventory reserves the company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs 
the markets in which the company operates are highly competitive  with new products and surgical procedures introduced on an ongoing basis 
such marketplace changes may cause some of the company s products to become obsolete 
the company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience  expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends 
if actual product life cycles  product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could unfavorably affect future operating results 
income taxes the company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states 
accordingly  management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions 
tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates 
because tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant  the company records accruals representing management s best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters 
to the extent additional information becomes available  such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome 
other matters the company distributes its products throughout the world 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
the company s operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the united states dollar and the japanese yen and european currencies  in particular the euro and the british pound 
when the united states dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases 
when the united states dollar strengthens  the opposite situation occurs 
the company manufactures its products in the united states  france  germany  ireland  switzerland  canada and puerto rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies 
this worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the company s cost of sales 
the company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies  thereby limiting risk to the company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
these nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products 
the periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions  with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies 
at december   the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase million and sell million of various currencies principally united states dollars and euros with maturities ranging principally from to days 
the estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points 
a hypothetical change in exchange rates for these currencies would change the december  fair value by approximately million 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
the company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged 
these investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currencies that are deferred and recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
for the year ended december   the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets  and the related deferred gain in stockholders equity  by million to million 
the company is partially self insured for product liability claims 
in  the company established a wholly owned captive insurance company in the united states to manage its self insured retention limits 
the captive insurance company provides insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims incurred but not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities 
the actuarial valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events 
in december  the company announced that its subsidiary physiotherapy associates  inc  and stryker received a subpoena from the united states attorney s office in boston  massachusetts  in connection with a department of justice investigation of physiotherapy associates billing and coding practices 
physiotherapy associates provides physical  occupational and speech therapy services to patients through outpatient centers in the united states as of december  and represented of stryker s net sales for each of the years ended december  and revenues derived from billings to us federal health care programs approximated of physiotherapy associates revenues during these periods 
the company is fully cooperating with the department of justice regarding this matter 
on october   the president of the united states signed the american jobs creation act of the act 
the act creates a temporary incentive for united states corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned in foreign jurisdictions by providing an dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
the deduction is subject to a number of limitations  and significant uncertainty remains about the way to interpret numerous provisions in the act 
due to these factors  the company is not yet in a position to determine whether  and to what extent  it might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the united states 
based on its current analysis  the company may repatriate up to million  with a related income tax expense and liability of up to million 
the company plans to finalize its assessment after congress or the treasury department provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the repatriation provision 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revision to statement no 
 share based payment 
this revision supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
this revision requires companies to recognize the cost of stock options based on the grant date fair value pursuant to their employee stock option plans over the period during which the recipient is required to provide services in exchange for the options  typically the vesting period 
pursuant to the requirements of the statement  the company plans to adopt the provisions of the standard during the third quarter of using the modified retrospective transition method provided in the statement 
under this method  the company will restate all prior periods presented on a consistent basis 
the company does not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on the trend of net earnings or net earnings per share
