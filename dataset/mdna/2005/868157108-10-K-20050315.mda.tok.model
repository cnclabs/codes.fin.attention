executive summary we are a leading provider of specialized oilfield services and equipment focused on serving the production related needs of oil and gas companies primarily in the gulf of mexico and the drilling related needs of oil and gas companies in the gulf of mexico and select international market areas 
we also own and operate  through our subsidiary spn resources  llc  mature oil and gas properties in the gulf of mexico 
our business is organized into five segments consisting of well intervention services  marine services  rental tools  other oilfield services and oil and gas operations 
the oil and gas industry remains highly cyclical and seasonal 
activity levels in our four service and rental segments are driven primarily by traditional energy indicators  which include current and expected future commodity prices  drilling rig count in the gulf of mexico for services and worldwide for rental tools  oil and gas production levels  and customers capital spending allocated for drilling and production  particularly in the gulf of mexico 
in  activity levels increased across all of our segments due to increased demand as a result of better market conditions  the acquisition of several mature oil and gas properties which yielded higher oil and gas production and utilization for our services and liftboats  geographic expansion  primarily in the rental tools segment  and further market acceptance of our bundled services strategy which led to additional higher margin  production related projects 
the acquisition of several mature gulf of mexico properties resulted in oil and gas production of approximately  barrels of oil equivalent boe  net of royalties  in as compared to approximately  boe in we incurred significant production downtime from mid september until late december as a result of damage caused by hurricane ivan 
the acquisition of mature properties increased the utilization of our assets by providing us with additional decommissioning opportunities 
we use our production related assets to enhance  maintain and extend existing production and  at the end of a property s economic life  to plug and decommission wells 
because we own and operate the properties  we are able to control when these services are provided and do so in a manner that employs our assets during seasonal downtime and at times we have available assets not otherwise being utilized 
work on our own properties accounted for of the utilization of our well services crews within our well intervention segment for  and and of their utilization for the first and fourth quarters of  respectively 
another factor impacting our growth in was our geographic expansion 
we now have domestic rental tool operations in louisiana  oklahoma  texas and wyoming  and international rental tool operations in venezuela  trinidad  mexico  eastern canada  the north sea  the middle east and west africa 
we also successfully capped several wells in egypt as part of an ongoing well control project 
international revenue in was a record million  a increase from the million of international revenue we recorded in 
table of contents finally  in  we performed more bundled services projects on producing wells than we have in past years 
historically  our bundled services were employed on retiring wells following the end of their economic lives 
we believe this is due to the use of our bundled services on our own producing wells  as well as a result of improving market conditions and further awareness of our bundled services offering 
we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on one of the most prevalent trends impacting our core shallow water gulf of mexico market the divestment of properties by larger energy producers 
the continued maturation of the market has led larger energy producers to sell assets in search of higher returning investments in the deepwater gulf of mexico and other developing markets worldwide 
as a result  small energy producers are substantially increasing their investment and presence on the gulf of mexico outer continental shelf 
our bundled strategy attempts to address these market dynamics and leverage the significant asset base dedicated to our core market 
in addition  as large energy producers continue to divest  we believe our financial flexibility and operational experience make us a likely candidate to continue acquiring additional mature producing properties 
well intervention segment the well intervention segment consists of specialized downhole services  which are both labor and equipment intensive 
while our gross margin percentage tends to be fairly consistent  special projects such as well control can directly increase the gross margin percentage 
revenue and operating income increased each quarter during as demand steadily improved throughout the year 
in  we benefited from removing and decommissioning our offshore properties 
in addition  our coiled tubing  mechanical wireline  plug and abandonment and well control operations grew from levels 
the mechanical wireline operations posted record revenues and operating income in our well control operations were involved in a major well control project during the fourth quarter 
marine segment liftboat operations have relatively high operating leverage  meaning that operating costs are fairly fixed and  therefore  gross margin percentages vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year based on changes in dayrates and utilization levels 
in  liftboat days worked increased almost and the average dayrate for our liftboat fleet was virtually unchanged as compared to however  the last half of was stronger than the first half of the year as liftboat days worked were about higher in the third and fourth quarters as compared to the first and second quarters 
in addition  the average fleet dayrate was higher during the last six months of the year as compared to the first six months 
rental tools segment in  our rental tools segment continued to grow through geographic expansion 
new locations in oklahoma  texas and wyoming yielded higher revenue and operating income in on site accommodations  and stabilization and downhole tubulars businesses 
our august acquisition of premier oilfield services resulted in increased rentals of specialty drill pipe and handling tools in the north sea  middle east and west africa 
in addition  we increased rentals of drill pipe  stabilizers and downhole tubulars and other related accessories in trinidad and mexico 
revenue and operating income grew in the first and second quarters before hurricane ivan shut down several deepwater gulf of mexico projects in the third quarter 
as a result  rentals in this market fell sharply and began to resume toward the end of the year 
the segment s gross margin percentage fell slightly as higher margin drill pipe rentals decreased in the third and fourth quarters 

table of contents other oilfield services segment more than half of this segment s revenues are derived from our offshore platform and property management business  a labor intensive business with low margins 
activity for this business increased as the group managed more properties from traditional customers and added properties we acquired in environmental services  such as dockside vessel and tank cleaning and non hazardous oilfield waste treatment  comprise most of the other revenue and operating income in this segment 
the increase in the gulf of mexico drilling rig count helped increase activity for our environmental services 
the segment s gross margin percentage in was unchanged from oil and gas segment in december  we began our oil and gas production and sales business 
through our subsidiary spn resources  llc  we acquire  manage and decommission mature properties in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico 
as of december   we had interests in offshore blocks containing structures and productive wells  of which approximately were producing 
following our acquisition of these properties  spn resources will produce and sell the remaining economic oil and gas reserves of these properties 
the lease operating expenses for these types of mature properties are typically higher than other properties because of the amount of well intervention service work required to enhance  maintain and extend production 
the gross operating margin is also a function of oil and gas prices 
the main objective of this new business segment is to provide additional opportunities for our well intervention services and our platform management businesses 
we intend to increase the utilization of our well intervention services by deploying these services on our own properties during periods of downtime 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to our consolidated financial statements contains a description of the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to long lived assets and goodwill  income taxes  allowance for doubtful accounts  self insurance and oil and gas properties 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we define a critical accounting policy or estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain 
we believe that the following are the critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimates but are not deemed critical as defined in this paragraph 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets  including oil and gas properties  used in operations when the estimated cash flows to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based upon  among other things  historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market rates  utilization levels  operating performance  and with respect to our oil and gas properties  future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves that will be produced from a field  the timing of this future production  future costs to produce the oil and natural gas and other factors 
our estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions or changes in an asset s operating performance 
if the sum of the cash flows is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the net carrying value of assets not fully recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimate of fair value represents our best estimate based 
table of contents on industry trends and reference to market transactions and is subject to variability 
the oil and gas industry is cyclical and our estimates of the period over which future cash flows will be generated  as well as the predictability of these cash flows  can have significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and  in periods of prolonged down cycles  may result in impairment charges 
goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions adversely change in the future  we may be required to record material impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
fas no 
requires that goodwill as well as other intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested annually for impairment 
we estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units which are consistent with our reportable segments using various cash flow and earnings projections 
we then compared these fair value estimates to the determined carrying value of our reporting units 
based on this test  the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying amount  and no impairment loss has been recognized 
our estimates of the fair value of these reporting units represent our best estimates based on industry trends and reference to market transactions 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
income taxes 
we provide for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this standard takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
our deferred tax calculation requires us to make certain estimates about our future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in our financial condition or the carrying value of existing assets and liabilities  could affect these estimates 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimated allowances are periodically reviewed  on a case by case basis  analyzing the customer s payment history and information regarding customer s creditworthiness known to us 
in addition  we record a reserve based on the size and age of all receivable balances against which we do not have specific reserves 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
self insurance 
we self insure up to certain levels for losses related to workers compensation  protection and indemnity  general liability  property damage  and group medical 
with the recent tightening in the insurance markets  we have elected to retain more risk by increasing our self insurance 
we accrue for these liabilities based on estimates of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
we regularly review our estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for losses through reserves 
we also have an actuary review our estimates for leases related to workers compensation and group medical on an annual basis 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information available  our financial results could be impacted if litigation trends  claims settlement patterns  health care costs and future inflation rates are different from our estimates 
although we believe adequate reserves have been provided for expected liabilities arising from our self insured obligations  and we believe that we maintain adequate reinsurance coverage  we cannot assure that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences 
oil and gas properties 
one of our subsidiaries  spn resources  llc  acquires mature oil and gas properties and assumes the related well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities 
we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our investment in oil and natural gas properties 
under the successful efforts method  the costs of successful exploratory wells and leases containing productive reserves are capitalized 
costs incurred to drill and equip developmental wells  including unsuccessful development wells are capitalized 
other costs such as geological and geophysical costs and the drilling costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed 
spn resources property purchases are recorded at the value exchanged at closing  combined with an estimate of its 
table of contents proportionate share of the decommissioning liability assumed in the purchase 
all capitalized costs are accumulated and recorded separately for each field and allocated to leasehold costs and well costs 
leasehold costs are depleted on a units of production basis based on the estimated remaining equivalent proved oil and gas reserves of each field 
well costs are depleted on a units of production basis based on the estimated remaining equivalent proved developed oil and gas reserves of each field 
we estimate the third party market value including an estimated profit to plug and abandon wells  abandon the pipelines  decommission and remove the platforms and clear the sites  and use that estimate to record our proportionate share of the decommissioning liability 
in estimating the decommissioning liabilities  we perform detailed estimating procedures  analysis and engineering studies 
whenever practical  we will utilize the services of our subsidiaries to perform well abandonment and decommissioning work 
when these services are performed by our subsidiaries  all recorded intercompany revenues and expenses are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
the recorded decommissioning liability associated with a specific property is fully extinguished when the property is completely abandoned 
the liability is first reduced by all cash expenses incurred to abandon and decommission the property 
if the liability exceeds or is less than our out of pocket costs then the difference is reported as income or loss in the period in which the work is performed 
we review the adequacy of our decommissioning liability whenever indicators suggest that the estimated cash flows underlying the liability have changed materially 
the timing and amounts of these cash flows are subject to changes in the energy industry environment and may result in additional liabilities recorded  which in turn would increase the carrying values of the related properties 
oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment in value on a field by field basis whenever indicators become evident 
we use our current estimate of future revenues and operating expenses to test the capitalized costs for impairment 
in the event net undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded based on the present value of expected future net cash flows over the economic lives of the reserves 
proved reserve estimates 
our reserve information is prepared by independent reserve engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the securities and exchange commission and generally accepted accounting principles 
there are a number of uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves  including many factors beyond our control such as commodity pricing 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that can not be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s guidelines  we use prices and costs determined on the date of the actual estimate and a discount rate to determine the present value of future net cash flow 
actual prices and costs may vary significantly  and the discount rate may or may not be appropriate based on outside economic conditions 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we enter into hedging transactions for our oil production to reduce exposure to the fluctuations in oil prices 
our hedging transactions to date have consisted of financially settled crude oil swaps and zero cost collars with a major financial institution 
we may in the future enter into these and other types of hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the market prices of oil and natural gas 
under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  we are required to record our derivative instruments at fair market value as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
the fair market value is an estimate based on future commodity prices available at the time of the calculation 
the fair market value could differ from actual settlements if the other party to the contract defaults on its obligations or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received 
comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   our revenues were million resulting in net income of million or diluted earnings per share 
for the year ended december   revenues were million and net income was million which includes million of pre tax other income due to the gain from insurance proceeds  diluted earnings per share was for the same period 
we experienced higher revenues from our rental tools and well intervention segments 
we also benefited from oil and gas production following our initial acquisition of properties in the gulf of mexico in december 
table of contents the following table compares our operating results for the years ended december  and gross margin is calculated by subtracting cost of services from revenue for each of our five business segments

total the following discussion analyzes our operating results on a segment basis 
well intervention segment revenue for our well intervention segment was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the same period in this segment s gross margin percentage increased to in the year ended december  from in we experienced increased demand for almost all of our services  and we also benefited by completing various decommissioning projects on our oil and gas properties 
these increases in demand and decommissioning projects contributed to the improvement in the segment s gross margin percentage 
rental tools segment revenue for our rental tools segment for the year ended december  was million  a increase over the increase in this segment s revenue was primarily due to an increased demand for our expanded inventory of downhole rental tool equipment and our continued international expansion  due primarily to the august acquisition of premier oilfield services 
in addition  we benefited from increased bolting  torque and on site machining work and increased rentals of stabilizers and housing units 
the gross margin percentage declined slightly to in the year ended december  from in of due primarily to a change in the mix of our rental revenue 
marine segment our marine segment revenue for the year ended december  slightly decreased from to million 
the gross margin percentage for the year ended december  remained unchanged at 
the fleet s average dayrate decreased slightly to  in the year ended december  from  in  but average utilization increased to for the year ended december  from in average fleet dayrates entering were significantly less than the same period a year ago due to lower demand for liftboats 
as liftboat utilization increased throughout the year  we began to experience higher rates  particularly in the third and fourth quarters 
other oilfield services segment other oilfield services revenue for the year ended december  was million  a decrease over the million in revenue for the lower revenue is primarily attributable to the sale of our construction and fabrication assets in august  which had revenue of approximately million in the gross margin percentage remained unchanged at in and the decrease in revenue resulted in a million operating loss for this segment in 
table of contents oil and gas segment oil and gas revenues were million and the gross margin percentage was for the year ended december   compared to revenues of million and gross margin percentage of for the year ended december  the increase in revenue is due to the fact that our oil and gas segment began in december and has benefited from the south pass acquisition completed in july the segment was negatively impacted by hurricane ivan which shut in or curtailed production from the south pass field beginning in mid september through late december depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the increase is primarily a result of depletion and accretion related to our oil and gas properties 
the increase is also the result of our acquisition of premier oilfield services in august and capital expenditures during and general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase is primarily the result of our acquisitions  internal growth and international expansion 
comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   our revenues were million resulting in net income of million or diluted earnings per share 
for the year ended december   our revenues were million and our net income was million or diluted earnings per share 
our increase in revenue and net income is the result of an overall increased demand for most of our services due to increased activity by our customers

revenue gross margin change change well intervention rental tools marine other oilfield services oil and gas total the following discussion analyzes our operating results on a segment basis 
well intervention segment revenue for our well intervention segment was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for this segment s gross margin percentage increased slightly to in the year ended december  from in the increase in revenue and gross margin percentage is the result of increased demand for almost all of our services as production related activity in the gulf of mexico increased 
our pumping and stimulation services benefited the most from the increased activity levels in the gulf of mexico while our hydraulic workover and well control services benefited from international activity 

table of contents rental tools segment revenue for our rental tools segment for the year ended december  was million  a increase over the increase in this segment s revenue was primarily due to an increased demand for our expanded inventory of rental tool equipment and our geographic expansion 
during  revenue from international markets grew as we continue to diversify outside of the gulf of mexico market area 
we acquired premier oilfield services  an aberdeen  scotland based provider of oilfield equipment rentals  in august to further this diversification 
the gross margin percentage decreased slightly to in from in due primarily to a change in the mix of the demand for our rental tools 
marine segment our marine revenue for the year ended december  increased over to million 
the fleet s average dayrate increased to approximately  in the year ended december  from approximately  in  and the average utilization decreased to for from in the gross margin percentage for the year ended december  decreased to from in while revenues and the average dayrate increased because of additions of three larger liftboats to the fleet during  a drop off in utilization and the increased costs of the new liftboats resulted in a lower gross margin percentage 
increased costs  including maintenance and insurance  also contributed to the decline in gross margin percentage 
other oilfield services segment other oilfield services revenue for the year ended december  was million  a decrease over the million in revenue in the gross margin percentage decreased slightly to in from in the lower revenue is attributable to a decrease in construction and fabrication revenue as the result of the sale of those assets in august  which was partially offset by increases in revenue from our field management services  growth in our oilfield waste treatment business and higher sales of oil spill containment equipment 
this segment s slightly lower gross margin percentage was due to additional costs associated with the sale of our construction and fabrication assets and the growth and expansion of our oilfield waste treatment business  which were partially offset by the increased sales of higher margin oil spill containment equipment 
oil and gas segment our oil and gas production did not begin until december  following our initial acquisition of properties in the gulf of mexico during that same month 
oil and gas revenues generated during that month were million and the gross margin percentage was 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion depreciation and amortization increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the increase resulted mostly from our larger asset base as a result of our capital expenditures during and general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase is primarily the result of our internal growth and the acquisition of premier oilfield services 
however  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue remained relatively unchanged at approximately for both periods 
liquidity and capital resources in the year ended december   we generated net cash from operating activities of million 
our primary liquidity needs are for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and acquisitions 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  compared to million at december  
table of contents we made million of capital expenditures during the year ended december   of which approximately million was used to expand and maintain our rental tool equipment inventory 
we also made million of capital expenditures to expand and maintain the asset base of our well intervention  marine  other oilfield services and oil and gas segments and million on construction and improvements to our facilities 
cash generated from our operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient funds for our identified capital projects 
we paid million during the year ended december  as a result of our business acquisitions  which includes additional consideration for prior acquisitions of million  of which million was earned  capitalized and accrued during  and million was earned  capitalized and accrued in we capitalized and accrued additional consideration of million for one prior acquisition  which was paid in the first quarter of during  our subsidiary  spn resources  llc  acquired additional oil and gas properties through the acquisition of interests in offshore leases 
under the terms of the transactions  we paid approximately million net of approximately million cash received  acquired the properties and assumed the related decommissioning liabilities 
we have a bank credit facility consisting of term loans in an aggregate amount of million outstanding at december  and a revolving credit facility of million  none of which was outstanding at december  we amended the credit facility effective june  to extend the maturity date of one of the term loans 
as of february   these balances were unchanged and the weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding under the credit facility was per annum 
indebtedness under the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets  including the pledge of the stock of our principal subsidiaries 
the credit facility contains customary events of default and requires that we satisfy various financial covenants 
it also limits our capital expenditures  our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions  make acquisitions  make changes to our capital structure  create liens  incur additional indebtedness or assume additional decommissioning liabilities 
we have million outstanding at december  in u 
s 
government guaranteed long term financing under title xi of the merchant marine act of  which is administered by the maritime administration marad  for two foot class liftboats 
this debt bears an interest rate of per annum and is payable in equal semi annual installments of  on every june rd and december rd through june  our obligations are secured by mortgages on the two liftboats 
this marad financing also requires that we comply with certain covenants and restrictions  including the maintenance of minimum net worth and debt to equity requirements 
we also have outstanding million of senior notes due the indenture governing the senior notes requires semi annual interest payments on every may th and november th through the maturity date of may  the indenture governing the senior notes contains certain covenants that  among other things  prevent us from incurring additional debt  paying dividends or making other distributions  unless our ratio of cash flow to interest expense is at least to  except that we may incur debt in addition to the senior notes in an amount equal to of our net tangible assets  which was approximately million at december  the indenture also contains covenants that restrict our ability to create certain liens  sell assets or enter into certain mergers or acquisitions 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december  amounts in thousands for our long term debt including interest payments  decommissioning liabilities and operating leases 
the interest payments on our variable debt were estimated using the rates in effect at december  the decommissioning liability amounts do not give any effect to our contractual right to receive amounts from third parties  which is approximately million  when decommissioning operations are performed 
we do not have any other material obligations or commitments 

table of contents description thereafter long term debt  including estimated interest payments decommissioning liabilities operating leases total we have no off balance sheet arrangements other than our potential additional consideration that may be payable as a result of our acquisitions 
while the amounts of additional consideration payable depend upon the acquired company s operating performance and are difficult to predict accurately  the maximum additional consideration that may be payable by us for completed acquisitions is approximately million 
these amounts are not classified as liabilities under generally accepted accounting principles and are not reflected in our financial statements until the amounts are fixed and determinable 
when amounts are determined  they are capitalized as part of the purchase price of the related acquisition 
we do not have any other financing arrangements that are not required under generally accepted accounting principles to be reflected in our financial statements 
we have identified capital expenditure projects that will require up to approximately million in  exclusive of any acquisitions 
we believe that our current working capital  cash generated from our operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient funds for our identified capital projects 
we intend to continue implementing our growth strategy of increasing our scope of services through both internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
we expect to continue to make the capital expenditures required to implement our growth strategy in amounts consistent with the amount of cash generated from operating activities  the availability of additional financing and our credit facility 
depending on the size of any future acquisitions  we may require additional equity or debt financing in excess of our current working capital and amounts available under our revolving credit facility 
hedging activities we enter into hedging transactions with major financial institutions to secure a commodity price for a portion of our future production and to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of oil 
we do not enter into hedging transactions for trading purposes 
crude oil hedges are settled based on the average of the reported settlement prices for west texas intermediate crude on the new york mercantile exchange nymex for each month 
we had no natural gas hedges as of december  we use financially settled crude oil swaps and zero cost collars that provide floor and ceiling prices with varying upside price participation 
our swaps and zero cost collars are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges 
with a financially settled swap  the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the hedged price for the transaction  and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the hedged price for the transaction 
with a zero cost collar  the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor price of the collar  and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the cap price for the collar 
we recognize the fair value of all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized  to the extent the hedge is effective  in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
for the year ended december   hedging settlement payments reduced oil revenues by million dollars  and we recognized no gains or losses due to hedge ineffectiveness

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates 
a discussion of our market risk exposure in financial instruments follows 
foreign currency exchange rates because we operate in a number of countries throughout the world  we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the us dollar 
the functional currency for most of our international operations is the us dollar  but a portion of the revenues from our foreign operations is paid in foreign currencies 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations are partly mitigated because local expenses of such foreign operations are also generally denominated in the same currency 
we continually monitor the currency exchange risks associated with all contracts not denominated in the us dollar 
any gains or losses associated with such fluctuations have not been material 
we do not hold any foreign currency exchange forward contracts and or currency options 
we have made limited use of derivative financial instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions 
we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes or use derivatives with leveraged or complex features 
derivative instruments are entered into with creditworthy major financial institutions 
assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated at current exchange rates  while income and expense are translated at average rates for the period 
translation gains and losses are reported as the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 

table of contents interest rates at december   million of our long term debt had variable interest rates 
based on debt outstanding at december   a increase in variable interest rates would increase our interest expense in the year by approximately  while a decrease would decrease our interest expense by approximately  commodity price risk our revenue  profitability and future rate of growth partially depends upon the market prices of oil and natural gas 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and gas that can economically be produced 
we use derivative commodity instruments to manage commodity price risks associated with future oil and natural gas production 
as of december   we had the following contracts in place crude oil positions instrument strike volume bbls remaining contract term type price bbl daily total bbls swap    collar    our hedged volume as of december  was approximately of our estimated production from proved reserves for the balance of the terms of the contracts 
had these contracts been terminated at december   the estimated loss would have been million net of taxes 
we used a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the hypothetical effect that changes in the market value of crude oil would have on the fair value of its existing derivative instruments 
based on the derivative instruments outstanding at december   a increase in the underlying commodity price  increased the net estimated loss associated with the commodity derivative instrument by million
