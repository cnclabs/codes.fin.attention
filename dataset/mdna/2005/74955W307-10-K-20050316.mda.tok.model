in connection with the sbc directory acquisition on september  and the spa acquisition on january   we incurred a significant amount of debt 
we issued preferred stock in november and borrowed funds under certain debt instruments in december therefore  our cash and debt balances during these periods were higher than in prior periods

corporate overview we are a leading yellow pages publisher and directional media company 
directional media is where consumers search to find who sells the goods and services they are ready to purchase 
we publish sprint branded yellow pages directories in states  with major markets including las vegas  nevada and orlando and lee county  florida  with a total distribution of approximately million serving approximately  local and national advertisers 
we also publish sbc branded yellow pages directories in illinois and northwest indiana  with a total distribution of approximately million serving approximately  local and national advertisers 
we also offer online city guides and search web sites in our major sprint markets under the best red yellow pages brand at www 
bestredyp 
com and in the chicagoland area at www 
chicagolandyp 
com 
we also sell local advertising in illinois and northwest indiana onto www 
smartpages 
com  sbc s internet yellow pages platform 
on september   we completed the acquisition of the directory publishing business sbc directory business of sbc communications  inc sbc in illinois and northwest indiana  including sbc s interests in the dontech ii partnership dontech  a general partnership between us and sbc collectively  the sbc directory acquisition 
see acquisitions sbc directory acquisition below for a further description of the acquisition 
on january   we completed the acquisition of the directory publishing business the spa directory business of sprint corporation sprint by acquiring all of the outstanding common stock of the various entities comprising sprint publishing advertising spa collectively  the spa acquisition 
see acquisitions spa acquisition below for a further description of the acquisition 
these acquisitions transformed donnelley into a leading publisher of yellow pages directories 
prior to the spa acquisition  we were one of the largest independent sales agents and pre press vendors for yellow pages advertising in the united states 
at the time  our revenue reflected sales commissions and pre press fees from  or other transactions with  our business partners  including sprint and sbc 
commencing in following the spa acquisition  our operating and financial results reflect our yellow pages publishing business  rather than our former business as a sales agent and pre press vendor for yellow pages advertising on behalf of other publishers 
as a publisher  we report the full value of advertising sales and certain direct costs under the deferral and amortization method 
dontech remained unchanged following the spa acquisition  but our investment in dontech was eliminated in connection with the sbc directory acquisition on september  during and in until the sbc directory acquisition  we continued to earn revenue from providing pre press publishing and other ancillary services relating to the sbc directory business and we continued to report partnership income from our investment in dontech 
during the third quarter of following the sbc directory acquisition  we revised our historical segment reporting to reflect the change in our business and to reflect the way management now reviews and analyzes the business 
our business of publishing yellow pages directories is now conducted in one reportable operating segment 
all pre press publishing services and other ancillary services previously performed on behalf of other publishers are now performed entirely on behalf of the directories we now publish 
as a result of the sbc directory acquisition  sbc ceased paying us revenue participation income  we consolidate all profits from dontech and our dontech partnership investment was eliminated 
consequently  partnership income was no longer reported commencing september  and accordingly  the previously reported dontech operating segment is no longer applicable 
see note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report and segment reporting below for more information regarding the company s segments 
forward looking information certain statements contained in this annual report on form k regarding donnelley s future operating results  performance  business plans or prospects and any other statements not constituting historical fact are forward looking statements subject to the safe harbor created by the private securities litigation reform act of where possible  words such as believe  expect  anticipate  should  will  would  planned  estimates  potential  goal  outlook  may  predicts  could  or the negative of those words and other comparable expressions  are used to identify such forward looking statements 
actual events or results may differ materially 
in evaluating those statements  you should specifically consider various factors  including the risks and uncertainties discussed below 
those factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any of rhd s forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements attributable to us or a person on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement 
all forward looking statements reflect only our current beliefs and assumptions with respect to our future results  business plans  and prospects  and are based solely on information currently available to us 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity or performance 
these forward looking statements are made as of the date of this annual report and  except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the sec  we assume no obligation to update or revise them or to provide reasons why actual results may differ 
such risks  uncertainties and contingencies include  without limitation  the following our ability to meet substantial debt service obligations we have a substantial amount of debt and significant debt service obligations due in large part to the financings related to the sbc directory acquisition and the spa acquisition 
as of december   we had total outstanding debt of  million and had million available under the revolver portion of our senior secured credit facility as amended to date  the credit facility 
on january   we issued million of senior notes due the holdco notes to finance the repurchase of approximately of our preferred stock from certain investment partnerships affiliated with the goldman sachs group  inc the gs funds 
as a result of our significant amount of debt and debt service obligations  we face increased risks regarding  among other things  the following our ability to obtain additional financing in excess of the borrowing capacity under our million revolving credit facility and or under the million of incremental borrowings potentially available under our term loans on satisfactory terms to fund working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions  investments  debt service requirements and other general corporate requirements is limited  we are more vulnerable to general economic downturns  competition and industry conditions  which could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may be less leveraged  we face increased exposure to rising interest rates as a portion of our debt is at variable interest rates  we have reduced availability of cash flow to fund working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other strategic initiatives  investments and other general corporate requirements because a substantial portion of our cash flow is needed to service our debt obligations  we have limited flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  the agreements governing our debt substantially limit our ability to access the cash flow and value of our subsidiaries and  therefore  to make payments on our debt  and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition if we were unable to service our debt or obtain additional financing  as needed 
our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance and our ability to refinance debt 
if we are unable to service our debt and fund our business  we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  defer or refuse to pursue certain strategic initiatives  seek additional debt financing or equity capital  restructure or refinance our debt or sell assets 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing  refinance existing debt or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all 
restrictive covenants under our debt and preferred stock agreements the indentures governing our million of senior notes the senior notes due  million of senior subordinated notes the subordinated notes due  and the holdco notes together with the senior notes and subordinated notes  collectively  the notes  and our credit facility  include a number of significant restrictive covenants 
these covenants could adversely affect us by limiting our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries  or to plan for or react to market conditions or to meet our capital needs 
these covenants  among other things  restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt  pay dividends on our equity interests or repurchase equity interests  make certain investments  enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates  expand into unrelated businesses  use assets as security in other transactions  and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies 
in addition  the credit facility includes other and more restrictive covenants and prohibits us from prepaying the notes while borrowings under the credit facility are outstanding 
the credit facility also requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and meet other financial tests 
our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could require us to repay these borrowings before their scheduled due date 
if we were unable to make this repayment or otherwise refinance these borrowings  the lenders under the credit facility and the holders of senior notes  which became secured in connection with the amendment and restatement of the credit facility for the sbc directory acquisition  could foreclose on substantially all of our assets 
in addition  these lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed under the credit facility  together with accrued interest  to be due and payable  which  in some instances  would be an event of default under the indentures governing the notes 
if we were unable to refinance these borrowings on favorable terms  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by increased costs and less favorable terms  including higher interest rates and more restrictive covenants 
any future refinancing of the credit facility is likely to contain similar restrictive covenants 
furthermore  the terms of the purchase agreement with respect to our preferred stock restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to  among other things incur additional debt  enter into major corporate transactions  pay dividends on shares of our common stock or repurchase shares of our common stock  enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates  and sell or acquire certain assets 
our failure to comply with these terms would result in a breach of this agreement  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
competition the united states directory advertising industry is highly competitive 
approximately of total united states directory advertising sales are attributable to regional bell operating company rboc and other incumbent directory publishers collectively  with rboc directory publishers  incumbent publishers that typically publish directories where they or their licensors or affiliates offer local phone service 
more than independent yellow pages directory publishers operating in the united states compete with those incumbent publishers and represent the remaining market share 
in nearly all markets  we compete with one or more yellow pages directory publishers  which are predominantly independent publishers  such as the us business of yell group ltd  transwestern publishing company llc and white publishing company 
we believe that acting as the exclusive  official incumbent publisher of directories for the incumbent local telephone company sbc and sprint in our markets provides us with a competitive advantage over independent publisher competitors 
see business competition for a discussion of the reasons we believe we have a competitive advantage over these independent publishers 
in some markets  we also compete with other incumbent publishers in overlapping and adjacent markets 
some of these independent publishers and many of these other incumbent publishers with which we compete are larger than us and have greater financial resources than we have 
we may not be able to compete effectively with these other publishers for advertising sales or acquisitions in the future 
we also compete for advertising sales with other traditional media  including newspapers  magazines  radio  direct mail  telemarketing  billboards and television 
we believe we also sustain a competitive advantage over many of these competitors 
see business competition for a discussion of the reasons we believe we have a competitive advantage over these other traditional media competitors 
many of these other traditional media competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources than we have 
we may not be able to compete effectively with these companies for advertising sales or acquisitions in the future 
the internet has emerged as a new medium for advertisers 
advances in technology have brought and likely will continue to bring new participants  new products and new channels to the industry  including increasing use of electronic delivery of traditional directory information and electronic search engines services 
the yellow pages directory advertising business is subject to changes arising from developments in technology  including information distribution methods and users preferences 
the use of the internet and wireless devices by consumers as a means to transact commerce may result in new technologies being developed and services being provided that could compete with our traditional products and services 
national search companies such as google and yahoo are focusing and placing large priorities on local commercial search initiatives 
our growth and future financial performance may depend on our ability to develop and market new products and services and create new distribution channels  while enhancing existing products  services and distribution channels  to incorporate the latest technological advances and accommodate changing user preferences  including the use of the internet and wireless devices 
we may not be able to respond successfully to any such developments 
through our online city guides  look and feel electronic directories and search web sites  we also compete with the internet yellow pages directories of independent and other incumbent directory publishers  and with other internet sites  including those available through wireless applications  that provide classified directory information  such as switchboard 
com  citysearch 
com and zagat 
com  and with search engines and portals  such as yahoo  google  msn and others  some of which have entered into affiliate agreements with other major directory publishers 
we may not be able to compete effectively with these other companies  some of which have greater resources than we do  for advertising sales or acquisitions in the future 
in addition  the market position of telephone utilities  including those with which we have relationships  may be adversely impacted by the telecommunications act of  which effectively opened local telephone markets to increased competition 
in addition  federal communication commission rules regarding local number portability  advances in communications technology such as wireless devices and voice over internet protocol and demographic factors such as potential shifts in younger generations away from wireline telephone communications towards wireless or other communications technologies may further erode the market position of telephone utilities  including sprint and sbc 
as a result  it is possible that sprint and or sbc will not remain the primary local telephone service provider in their local service areas 
if either sprint or sbc were no longer the primary local telephone service provider in any particular local service area  our license to be the exclusive publisher in that market and to use the sprint or sbc brand name  as the case may be  on our directories in that market may not be as valuable as we presently anticipate  and we may not realize some of the existing benefits under our commercial arrangements with sprint or sbc 
sprint recently announced that it may spin off its local telephone operations if its merger with nextel communications is consummated 
while our contractual arrangements with sprint provide that any successor to the local telephone business must enter into substantially similar arrangements with us for the remaining term of our agreement with sprint  it is possible that the spin off could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition if the spun off business does not perform as well as it would have if it had remained part of a larger company 
while sbc s proposed acquisition of at t has not yet raised any issues regarding the value of our contractual relationship with sbc  we cannot assure you that the form of or ramifications from any such transaction would not have some material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
usage of printed yellow pages directories and changes in technology 
from to  overall references to print yellow pages directories in the united states declined  however  overall references to print yellow pages directories have remained relatively stable from through we believe the past decline was primarily a result of demographic shifts among consumers  particularly the increase of households in which english was not the primary language spoken 
we also believe that the past decline was attributable to increased usage of internet based directory products  particularly in business to business and retail categories  as well as the proliferation of very large retail stores for which consumers and businesses may not reference the yellow pages 
we believe that over the next several years  references to print yellow pages directories may gradually decline as users may increasingly turn to digital and interactive media delivery devices for local commercial search information 
any decline in usage could impair our ability to maintain or increase advertising prices  cause businesses that purchase advertising in our yellow pages directories to reduce or discontinue those purchases  and discourage businesses that do not purchase advertising in our yellow pages directories from doing so 
any of the factors that may contribute to a decline in usage of our print directories  or a combination of them  could impair our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business 
the yellow pages directory advertising business is subject to changes arising from developments in technology  including information distribution methods and users technological preferences 
the use of the internet by consumers as a means to transact commerce may result in new technologies being developed and services being provided that could compete with our products and services 
as a result of these factors  our growth and future financial performance may depend on our ability to develop and market new products and services and create new distribution channels  while enhancing existing products  services and distribution channels  to incorporate the latest technological advances and accommodate changing user preferences  including the use of the internet 
we may not be able to provide services over the internet successfully or compete successfully with other internet based directory services 
in addition  if we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and user preferences or are unable to finance the capital expenditures necessary to respond to such changes  our results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
integration of the sbc directory business into our operations the integration of the sbc directory business into our operations involves a number of risks  including difficulty integrating operations  diversion of management attention  potential disruption of ongoing business because of the unknown reactions to the combination of the acquired business and donnelley by vendors  customers and other key constituencies  difficulties in assimilating the employees  technologies  services and products of the acquired business  inability to retain key personnel  inability to successfully incorporate acquired business components with our existing infrastructure  and inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies 
we intend to invest significantly in the sbc directory business  which could reduce our future earnings and cash flow 
the funds we invest in the sbc directory business may not be sufficient to improve the operating performance of this business from historical levels 
despite the completed transition of the billing and collection functions  it is possible that advertisers may be confused by the change in billing party and or less likely to pay us for their directory advertising than they were to pay the provider of their local phone service 
accordingly  we cannot provide any assurance that our bad debt levels will not increase as a result of this billing and collection transition 
if we are unable to effectively integrate operations in a timely and efficient manner  we may not realize the benefits expected from the sbc directory acquisition 
failure to overcome these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the sbc directory acquisition could slow our growth and or lower the quality of our services  which could reduce customer demand 
impact of bankruptcy proceedings against sprint or sbc during the term of the respective commercial arrangements contract rights under the directory services license agreement  trademark license agreement and non competition agreement with sprint and its affiliates and under the directory services license agreement and non competition agreement with sbc and its affiliates constitute a substantial portion of our commercial arrangements with sprint and sbc  as the case may be 
pursuant to these commercial arrangements  we are the exclusive directory publisher for sprint in the markets where sprint provided telephone service at the time of the relevant agreements and for sbc in illinois and northwest indiana 
if a bankruptcy case were to be commenced by or against sprint or sbc  as the case may be  it is possible that all or part of the applicable agreements could be considered an executory contract and could therefore be subject to rejection by sprint or sbc  as the case may be  or by a trustee appointed in a bankruptcy case pursuant to section or section of the united states bankruptcy code 
if one or more of these agreements were rejected  the applicable agreement may not be specifically enforceable  in which case we would have only an unsecured claim for damages against sprint or sbc  as the case may be  for the breach of contract resulting from the rejection 
if the applicable directory services license agreement were rejected  we would  among other things  no longer be entitled to be sprint s or sbc s  as the case may be  exclusive publisher of telephone directories in the affected markets 
we could also lose our right to use sprint s and or sbc s name and logo  as the case may be  and to enforce the provisions of the applicable agreements under which we have the right to license trademarks of successor local exchange carriers in the sprint or sbc markets  as the case may be 
if the applicable non competition agreement were rejected and specific enforcement were not available  sprint or sbc  as the case may be  would  among other things  no longer be precluded from publishing print telephone directories or selling certain advertising in the respective applicable restricted markets 
in connection with the spa acquisition  sprint created a bankruptcy remote special purpose vehicle in the form of a limited liability company and contributed and assigned the trademarks being licensed to us under the trademark license agreement to this limited liability company 
the operating agreements of this limited liability company require  among other things  that the board of managers of this entity include one independent manager that is unaffiliated with sprint 
the consent of this independent manager is required for the entity to take certain actions  including  among other things  commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding 
because the trademarks were contributed to this limited liability company  our rights under the trademark license agreement are not subject to rejection in the event of a bankruptcy proceeding involving sprint unless there is also a bankruptcy proceeding involving this limited liability company 
although we believe that the likelihood of this entity being the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding is limited by this structure and the governing provisions of the operating agreement  if the trademark license agreement were rejected in a bankruptcy proceeding  we would lose the right to use the sprint brand name for the former spa directories we now publish in those markets 
in the sbc directory acquisition  no bankruptcy remote special purpose vehicles have been established so that we are relatively more susceptible to bankruptcy risk with respect to the commercial arrangement with sbc and its affiliates  although management believes that sbc s credit rating and financial position are significantly better than that of sprint at the time of the spa acquisition 
the loss of any rights under any of these arrangements with sprint and its affiliates or sbc and its affiliates may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our inability to enforce the non competition agreements with sprint or sbc in connection with the spa acquisition and the sbc directory acquisition  sprint and sbc each entered into a non competition agreement with us 
the sprint non competition agreement prohibits sprint in the markets where sprint provided local telephone service at the time of the transaction from selling local directory advertising or producing  publishing and distributing print directories  with certain limited exceptions 
the sbc non competition agreement prohibits sbc from producing  publishing and distributing print directories in illinois and northwest indiana  from selling local or national directory advertising in such directories and from selling local internet yellow pages advertising for certain internet yellow pages directories or from licensing certain sbc marks to a third party for that purpose  subject to limited exceptions 
however  under state and federal law  a covenant not to compete is only enforceable to the extent it is necessary to protect a legitimate business interest of the party seeking enforcement  if it does not unreasonably restrain the party against whom enforcement is sought  and if it is not contrary to the public interest 
enforceability of a non competition covenant is determined by a court based on all of the facts and circumstances of the specific case at the time enforcement is sought 
for this reason  it is not possible for us to predict whether  or to what extent  a court would enforce either sprint or sbc s covenants not to compete against us during the term of the non competition agreement 
if a court were to determine that the non competition agreement is unenforceable  sprint or sbc  as the case may be  could compete directly against us in the previously restricted markets 
our inability to enforce the non competition agreement with sprint or sbc could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
early termination of commercial arrangements with sprint or sbc our commercial arrangements with each of sprint and sbc have an initial term of years  subject to specified automatic renewal and early termination provisions 
these commercial arrangements with sprint and sbc may be terminated by them prior to their stated term under certain specified circumstances  some of which at times may be beyond our reasonable control and or which may require extraordinary efforts or the incurrence of material excess costs on our part in order to avoid breach of the applicable agreement 
it is possible that these arrangements will not remain in place for their full stated term or that we may be unable to avoid all potential breaches of or defaults under these commercial arrangements 
further  any remedy exercised by sprint or sbc  as the case may be  under any of these arrangements with sprint or sbc could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
future changes in directory publishing obligations in illinois and northwest indiana pursuant to the directory services license agreement with sbc  we are required to discharge sbc s regulatory obligation to publish white pages directories covering each service territory in the illinois and indiana markets for which we acquired the sbc directory business 
if the staff of a state public utility commission in illinois or indiana were to impose additional or changed legal requirements in any of these service territories with respect to this obligation  we would be obligated to comply with these requirements on behalf of sbc  even if such compliance were to increase our publishing costs 
pursuant to the directory services agreement  sbc will generally not be obligated to reimburse us for any increase in our costs of publishing directories that satisfy sbc s publishing obligations 
our results of operations relative to competing directory publishers could be adversely affected if we are not able to increase our revenues to cover any such unreimbursed compliance costs 
our directory services license agreement with sprint generally provides that sprint will reimburse us for material increases in our costs relating to our complying with sprint s directory publishing obligations in our sprint markets 
transition services arrangements with sbc in connection with the sbc directory acquisition  we entered into a transition services agreement with sbc under which affiliates of sbc continue to perform certain functions on behalf of the sbc directory business 
the primary transition services provided by sbc and its affiliates under this agreement include certain information technology support  certain marketing services  certain pre press publishing and distribution services  and certain customer service and billing and collection services 
substantially all of these functions will be assumed by us at various times through the third quarter of while there are certain performance standards and estimated costs specified in the transition services agreement and we expect sbc to appropriately discharge its obligations under the agreement consistent with the specified standards and estimated costs  we do not control sbc and there can be no assurance that all of these functions will be successfully executed on a timely basis or that we will not have to expend extraordinary efforts or material costs in excess of those estimated in the transition services agreement 
further  any interruption in these services or such extraordinary efforts or costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
one of the most critical functions performed by sbc under the transition services agreement related to billing and collection 
under that agreement  the local sbc telephone company billed and collected from our local advertising customers in the illinois and northwest indiana directories and remitted collections net of a specified holdback to us through early on a monthly basis commencing september   sbc provided an advance to us related to those receivables  and as such  we recorded an advance from sbc that was decreased as sbc collected from our advertisers  thus satisfying that liability 
in early  we assumed all responsibility for billing and collections and settled remaining amounts with sbc 
despite the completed transition of the billing and collection functions  it is possible that advertisers may be confused by the change in billing party and or less likely to pay us for their directory advertising than they were to pay the provider of their local phone service 
accordingly  we cannot provide any assurance that our bad debt levels will not increase as a result of this billing and collection transition 
reliance on  and extension of credit to  small and medium sized businesses approximately of our directory advertising revenue is derived from selling advertising to small and medium sized businesses 
in the ordinary course of our yellow pages publishing business  we extend credit to these advertisers for advertising purchases 
small and medium sized businesses  however  tend to have fewer financial resources and higher failure rates than large businesses 
the proliferation of very large retail stores may continue to harm small and medium sized businesses 
we believe these limitations are significant contributing factors to having advertisers in any given year not renew their advertising in the following year 
in addition  full or partial collection of delinquent accounts can take an extended period of time 
consequently  we could be adversely affected by our dependence on and our extension of credit to small and medium sized businesses 
dependence on third party providers of printing  distribution and delivery services we depend on third parties for the printing and distribution of our directories 
we are a party to two contracts with rr donnelley for the printing of our directories 
printing is one of our largest costs items accounting for approximately of our total operating and general and administrative expenses 
although these contracts do not expire until december and december  because of the large print volume and specialized binding of directories  there are a limited number of companies capable of servicing our printing needs 
accordingly  the inability or unwillingness of rr donnelley to provide printing services to us on acceptable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business 
no common ownership or other business affiliation exists between rr donnelley and us 
we are a party to contracts with three companies for the distribution of our directories 
although these contracts are scheduled to expire at various times between may and february  any of these vendors may terminate its contract with us upon days written notice 
there are a limited number of companies capable of servicing our delivery needs 
accordingly  the inability or unwillingness of our current vendors to provide delivery services to us on acceptable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business 
fluctuations in the price and availability of paper our principal raw material is paper 
we currently contract with four vendors for the purchasing of paper 
these agreements expire at various times from december  through december  pursuant to the contract under which we obtain the great majority of our paper and which extends through december   the price of the paper was set at inception and increases at various dates during the term of the agreement 
should the market price of the paper drop below the set prices under that contract  both parties are obligated to negotiate in good faith a lower paper price 
we are subject to delays in receiving this principal raw material 
further  changes in the supply of  or demand for  paper could affect market prices or delivery times 
paper is one of our largest cost items accounting for approximately to of our total operating and general and administrative expenses 
we cannot assure you that we will have available necessary raw materials at reasonable prices or that any increases in paper costs would not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the sale of advertising to national accounts is coordinated by third parties that we do not control approximately of our directory advertising revenues is derived from the sale of advertising to national or large regional companies  such as rental car companies  automobile repair shops and pizza delivery businesses  each of which generally purchases advertising in several of our directories 
substantially all of the revenue derived from national accounts is serviced through certified marketing representatives cmrs with whom we contract 
cmrs are independent third parties that act as agents for national companies and design their advertisements  arrange for the placement of those advertisements in directories and provide billing services 
as a result  our relationships with these national advertisers depend significantly on the performance of these third party cmrs whom we do not control 
although we believe that our relationships with these cmrs have been mutually beneficial  if some or all of the cmrs with whom we have established relationships were unable or unwilling to do business with us on acceptable terms or at all  such inability or unwillingness could materially adversely affect our business 
during  we began acting as a cmr directly placing certain national advertising 
it is possible that such a development could adversely impact our relationships with cmrs or expose us to possible legal claims from cmrs 
we are also subject to credit risk with cmrs with whom we contract 
general economic factors our business results could be adversely affected by a prolonged national or regional economic recession 
we derive substantially all of our net revenue from the sale of advertising in directories 
typically  our advertising revenues  as well as those of yellow pages publishers in general  do not fluctuate widely with economic cycles 
however  a prolonged national or regional economic recession could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
as a result  we may experience lower than expected revenues for our business in the future 
in addition  any residual economic effects of  and uncertainties regarding the general possibility  express threat or future occurrence of terrorist or other related disruptive events  or the united states continuing or expanded involvement in war  especially with respect to the major markets in which we operate that depend heavily upon travel  tourism or the military  could adversely affect our business 
including the operations of our sbc directory business  we expect that approximately of our net revenues will be derived from the sale of sbc branded directory advertising and other related products and services in illinois and northwest indiana 
the midwest economy  and particularly chicago  has been relatively slower to recover from the economic recession than many other parts of the country and many of our other markets  especially many of our nevada and florida markets 
while the sbc directory acquisition moderated our dependence on and risk associated with heavily tourist driven economies  it increased our exposure to and risk associated with the slower growth midwest economy 
as a result  we may experience lower than previously expected revenue growth in the future 
turnover among our sales force or key management our ability to achieve our business plan depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify  hire  train and retain qualified sales personnel in each of the regions in which we operate 
we expend a significant amount of resources and management time on identifying and training our sales representatives and sales managers 
our ability to attract and retain qualified sales personnel depends on numerous factors  including factors outside of our control  such as conditions in the local employment markets in which we operate 
a decrease in the number of sales representatives and sales managers could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity  as well as our ability to service our debt 
furthermore  we depend on the continued services of key personnel  including our experienced senior management team as well as our regional sales management personnel 
although we believe that we could replace our senior management team and other key employees within a reasonable time period should the need arise  the loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the loss of important intellectual property rights some trademarks such as the sprint  sbc and donnelley brand names and other intellectual property rights are important to our business 
we rely upon a combination of copyright and trademark laws as well as contractual arrangements  including licensing agreements  particularly with respect to sprint and sbc markets  to establish and protect our intellectual property rights 
we are required from time to time to bring lawsuits against third parties to protect our intellectual property rights 
similarly  from time to time  we are party to proceedings whereby third parties challenge our rights 
we cannot be sure that any lawsuits or other actions brought by us will be successful or that we will not be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 
although we are not aware of any material infringements of any trademark rights that are significant to our business  any lawsuits  regardless of their outcome  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  we only have rights to use the sprint and sbc name and logos in certain markets 
the loss of important intellectual property rights such as trademarks could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
information technology modernization effort we are in the process of upgrading and modernizing our legacy amdocs process management infrastructure to amdocs igen platform  an integrated  web based  fully scalable set of business applications 
while we expect this modernization effort to permit us to advance our digital local commercial search and integrated media strategy by more effectively and efficiently capturing and organizing our local market content  the modernization effort is complicated and is expected to take the next to months to fully implement 
during the modernization effort we may experience a disruption to our business 
we cannot assure you that any disruption caused by the modernization effort will not materially adversely affect our business 
in addition  we expect to incur approximately million of capital expenditures and approximately million in expenses over the next months in connection with this modernization effort  which is higher than our historical levels of capital expenditures and represents funds that would otherwise have been available to repay debt or for other strategic or general corporate purposes

we also issued the senior notes and the senior subordinated notes 
additionally  we issued million of preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock to the gs funds 
to take advantage of favorable market conditions and to ensure the timely consummation of the spa acquisition  we issued the senior notes and the senior subordinated notes and borrowed the term loan b in december the total gross proceeds of  million were deposited and held in escrow pending the spa acquisition closing 
we issued million of preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  with an exercise price of per share in november to the gs funds 
at the closing of the spa acquisition  we issued the remaining million of preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  with an exercise price of per share to the gs funds

our business of publishing yellow pages directories is now conducted in one reportable operating segment 
all pre press publishing services and other ancillary services previously performed on behalf of others are now performed entirely on behalf of the directories we publish 
as a result of the sbc directory acquisition  sbc ceased paying us revenue participation income  we consolidate all net profits from dontech and our dontech partnership investment was eliminated 
consequently  partnership income was no longer reported commencing on september  and  accordingly  the previously reported dontech operating segment is no longer applicable 
during  our reportable segments were donnelley and dontech 
the donnelley segment included revenue from our sprint branded yellow pages directories and our pre press publishing services contract with sbc  and all operating and administrative expenses 
the dontech segment included revenue participation income from sbc and our interest in the net profits of dontech 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to estimate the effect of various matters that are inherently uncertain as of the date of the financial statements 
each of these estimates varies in regard to the level of judgment involved and its potential impact on the company s reported financial results 
estimates are deemed critical when a different estimate could have reasonably been used or when changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  and could materially impact the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the company s significant accounting polices are discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
the critical estimates inherent in these accounting polices are discussed below 
management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate these amounts in the company s consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales claims we record our revenue net of an allowance for sales claims 
in addition  we record a provision for bad debts 
the provision for bad debts and allowance for sales claims are estimated for each directory based on historical experience 
we also evaluate the current condition of our customer balances  bankruptcy filings  any change in credit policy  historical charge off patterns  recovery rates and other data when determining our allowance for doubtful accounts reserve 
we review these estimates periodically to assess whether additional adjustment is needed based on economic events or other circumstances  including actual experience at the end of the billing and collection cycle with respect to each directory 
we believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales claims is adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions  however  significant deterioration in any of the factors noted above or in the overall economy could materially change these expectations 
the provisions for sales claims and doubtful accounts are estimated based on a percentage of revenue 
accordingly  an additional change in these allowance percentages would have impacted gaap net income by approximately million and adjusted pro forma net income by million 
see adjusted and pro forma amounts and other non gaap measures below for a description and reconciliation of adjusted pro forma net income to reported gaap net income 
pension benefits our pension plan obligations and related assets of the company s defined benefit retirement plans and those related to the dontech employees of the sbc directory business are presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
plan assets consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments and are valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries and through the use of a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate  the rate of future salary increases and the long term expected return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate  we consider yields on high quality  fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments 
salary increase assumptions are based upon historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
asset returns are based upon the anticipated average rate of earnings expected on invested funds of the plan over the long run 
at december   the weighted average actuarial assumptions were discount rate of  long term rate of return on plan assets of  and assumed salary increases of 
net periodic pension costs recognized in were million 
a change in the discount rate would affect net income by approximately million  a change in the long term rate of return on plan assets would affect net income by approximately million  and a change in assumed salary increases would affect net income by approximately million 
intangible assets and goodwill valuation and amortization our intangible assets consist of directory services agreements between the company and each of sprint and sbc  respectively  established customer relationships and trademarks and trade names  all resulting from the spa acquisition and the sbc directory acquisition 
the intangible assets are being amortized over the period the assets are expected to contribute to the cash flow of the company  which reflect the expected pattern of benefit 
our recorded goodwill resulted from the spa acquisition and the sbc directory acquisition and is not subject to amortization 
the intangible assets are subject to an impairment test in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  and the goodwill is subject to an impairment test in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the company reviews the carrying value of its intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the impairment test for the intangible assets is performed by comparing the carrying amount of the intangible assets to the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows 
in accordance with sfas  impairment exists if the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the intangible asset  or to its related group of assets 
impairment would result in a write down of the intangible asset to its estimated fair value based on the discounted future cash flows 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit to which it was assigned to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
in accordance with sfas  impairment exists if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is less than its estimated fair value 
impairment would result in a write down equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
we used certain estimates and assumptions in our impairment evaluation  including  but not limited to  projected future cash flows  revenue growth  customer attrition levels  and estimated write offs 
as of december   management believes that there was no impairment to the intangible assets or goodwill 
however  significant deterioration in our business  the assumptions underlying the impairment evaluations  or in the overall economy  could result in impairment charges in future reporting periods 
had the aggregate net book value of the intangible assets and goodwill at december  been impaired by  net income on both a reported gaap and adjusted pro forma basis in would have been adversely impacted by approximately million 
see adjusted and pro forma amounts and other non gaap measures below for a description and reconciliation of adjusted pro forma net income to reported gaap net income 
additionally  management must assess whether the remaining useful lives of the intangible assets represent the period that the intangible assets are expected to contribute to our cash flow 
in our assessment process  we used certain estimates and assumptions  including projected future cash flows  customer attrition levels and industry and economic conditions 
in accordance with sfas  we evaluate the remaining useful lives annually to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
if the estimated remaining useful lives change  the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life 
for the year ended december   amortization of intangible assets was approximately million 
had the remaining useful lives of the intangible assets been shortened by  net income on a reported gaap and the adjusted pro forma basis in would have been adversely impacted by approximately million and million  respectively 
see adjusted and pro forma amounts and other non gaap measures below for a description and reconciliation of adjusted pro forma net income to reported gaap net income 
new accounting pronouncements new accounting pronouncements 
on december   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment fas r 
fas r requires companies to calculate the fair value of stock options granted to employees  and amortize that amount over the vesting period as an expense through the income statement 
the accounting provisions of fas r are effective for interim periods beginning after june   but companies have a choice of transition methods modified prospective  modified retrospective  or early adoption 
the company is presently evaluating the transition method and effective date for transition to fas r during and what impact adoption of fas r may have on the company 
in may  the financial accounting standards board issued financial staff position fsp no 
fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  which provides guidance on accounting for the effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of for employers that sponsor postretirement healthcare plans that provide drug benefits 
the act introduces prescription drug care benefits under medicare and also allows for certain sponsors of postretirement benefit plans with a drug benefit to receive a non taxable federal subsidy if certain criteria are met 
the fsp requires interim and annual period financial statements beginning after june  to include the effect of the subsidy on the measurement of net periodic postretirement benefit costs 
we adopted the provisions of the fsp in the fourth quarter of  which resulted in decrease to our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of approximately million 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  factors affecting comparability acquisitions as a result of the sbc directory acquisition and the spa acquisition  the related financings and associated purchase accounting  our reported gaap results are not comparable to our reported gaap results 
additionally  these considerations with respect to the sbc directory acquisition will also affect the comparability of our and reported gaap results 
under the deferral and amortization method of revenue recognition  the billable value of directories published is recognized as revenue in subsequent reporting periods 
however  purchase accounting precluded us from recognizing directory revenue and certain expenses associated with directories that published prior to each acquisition  including all directories published in the month each acquisition was completed 
thus  our reported and gaap results are not indicative of our underlying operating and financial performance 
accordingly  management is presenting adjusted pro forma information that  among other things  eliminates the purchase accounting impact on revenue and expenses for each acquisition and assumes the sbc directory acquisition and related financing occurred at the beginning of management believes that the presentation of this adjusted pro forma information will help financial statement users better and more easily compare current period underlying operating results against what the combined company performance would more likely have been in the comparable prior period 
all of the adjusted pro forma amounts disclosed under the caption adjusted pro forma amounts and other non gaap measures or elsewhere are non gaap measures  which are reconciled to the most comparable gaap measures under that caption below 
while we believe the adjusted pro forma results reasonably represent results as if the businesses had been combined for the full years and  because of differences in the application of accounting policies and practices between the company and the acquired entities  management does not believe these adjusted pro forma amounts are strictly comparable  nor are they necessarily indicative of results for future periods 
before the sbc directory acquisition  we reported our share of dontech net income as partnership income in our consolidated statement of operations 
partnership income also included revenue participation income from sbc 
revenue participation income was based on dontech advertising sales and was recognized when a sales contract was executed with a customer 
upon the sbc directory acquisition  sbc ceased paying us revenue participation income  we consolidate all net profits of dontech and our partnership investment was eliminated 
consequently  commencing on september   we no longer report partnership income 
during and in until the sbc directory acquisition  we earned revenue from pre press publishing and other ancillary services related to the sbc directory business and we continued to report partnership income from our investment in dontech 
relocation and integration charges our expenses include million related to the relocation of our corporate offices to cary  north carolina  million related to the acquisition and integration of the sbc directory business  and million for sales offices relocation expenses related to the spa acquisition 
our expenses include severance and move related charges of million relating to the relocation of our corporate offices to cary  north carolina and million for the consolidation of our publishing and technology operations  sales offices and administrative staff in connection with the spa acquisition 
gaap reported results net revenue the components of our net revenue in and were as follows for the years ended december  amounts in millions change gross directory advertising revenue sales allowances net directory advertising revenue pre press publishing and application service fees other revenue total following the sbc directory acquisition  substantially all of our revenue is derived from our directory publishing business 
before the sbc directory acquisition  dontech was accounted for under the equity method 
our directory advertising revenue is earned primarily from the sale of advertising in the yellow pages directories we publish  net of sales allowances 
revenue from directory advertising sales is recognized under the deferral and amortization method  whereby revenue from advertising sales is initially deferred when the directory is published and recognized ratably over the directory s life  which is typically months 
before the sbc directory acquisition  we also earned pre press publishing fees with respect to services we rendered on behalf of sbc for the sbc branded directories we now publish 
these fees were  and other income is  recognized when earned 
total net revenue in was million compared to million in the primary increase in total net revenue in is a result of purchase accounting related to the spa acquisition that adversely impacted results 
due to purchase accounting  directory revenue for the year ended december  excluded the amortization of the publication sales for sprint branded directories published before february under the deferral and amortization method totaling million that would have been reported during absent purchase accounting 
total revenue in also includes million of net revenue from the sbc branded directories we published following the sbc directory acquisition 
while purchase accounting related to the sbc directory acquisition also negatively impacted results  because that transaction closed on september   its impact was not as material to results as purchase accounting related to the spa acquisition was to results 
purchase accounting related to the sbc directory acquisition will continue to adversely impact reported revenue through additionally  we expect net revenue in to be significantly higher than in due to a full year of results from the acquired sbc directory business 
revenue from pre press publishing and sales related computer application services in was million compared to million in the decrease in pre press publishing fees is a result of the company no longer providing such services to sbc following the sbc directory acquisition 
we now support internally the sbc branded directories we publish 
additionally  pre press publishing fees in totaling million reflect fees earned from a third party pre press publishing contract for which we ceased providing services in the first half of there was no comparable revenue earned in other revenue includes late fees paid on outstanding customer balances  commissions earned on sales contracts with respect to advertising placed into other publishers directories  sales of directories and certain other products and fees from telephone companies for publishing their information pages 
the increase in other revenue is primarily due to the sbc directory acquisition 
expenses the components of our total expenses for and were as follows for the years ended december  amounts in millions change operating expenses g a expenses d a expense total substantially all expenses are derived from our directory publishing business 
before the sbc directory acquisition  dontech was accounted for under the equity method 
we began recognizing expenses related to the sbc directory business on september  certain costs directly related to the selling and production of directories are initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the directory 
these costs include sales commissions and print  paper and initial distribution costs 
all of other expenses are recognized as incurred 
operating expenses total operating expenses in were million compared to million in the primary components of the million increase in operating expenses in  compared to  were as follows change amounts in millions expenses excluded from gaap results due to spa purchase accounting increased sales  manufacturing and other expenses related to the acquired sbc directory business cost uplift in from the sbc transaction increased sales expenses due to improved spa sales performance increased marketing and advertising expenses decreased publishing and information technology costs due to spa integration actions taken in difference between cost uplift in compared to from the spa transaction total increase in operating expenses  compared to the increase in operating expenses in is primarily a result of the same purchase accounting impacts as in related to the spa acquisition that precluded our reporting revenue related to spa directories that published before february similar to the deferral and amortization method of revenue recognition  certain costs directly related to the selling and production of our directories are initially deferred when incurred and recognized ratably over the life of a directory 
due to the elimination of spa s deferred costs for all directories published pre acquisition including january as required by purchase accounting  our reported operating expenses in did not include certain expenses associated with those directories totaling approximately million for the year ended december  due to these adjustments  directory expenses for the year december  include only the amortization of deferred directory costs relating to directories published beginning in february in  operating expenses were also impacted by the sbc transaction 
as a result of the sbc directory acquisition completed on september   we incurred incremental selling  manufacturing and indirect expenses of approximately million in the last four months of to support the operations of the newly acquired business 
while purchase accounting related to the sbc directory acquisition also impacted results  because the transaction closed on september   its impact was not as material to results as purchase accounting related to the spa acquisition was to results 
as a result of purchase accounting required by gaap  we recorded the deferred directory costs related to directories that were scheduled to publish subsequent to the spa acquisition and sbc directory acquisition  at their fair value  determined as a the estimated billable value of the published directory less b the expected costs to complete the directories  plus c a normal profit margin 
we refer to this purchase accounting entry as cost uplift 
the fair value of these costs in was determined to be million and million for the sbc directory acquisition and the spa acquisition  respectively 
these costs are amortized as operating expenses over the terms of the applicable directories and such amortization totaled million in related to the sbc directory acquisition 
for the spa acquisition  we amortized million of cost uplift in this compares to million in related to the spa acquisition  or a decrease of million in the year ended december  in  we also incurred approximately million in additional selling expenses  compared to  due to the improved sales results in the spa markets 
the additional expenses primarily included commissions  sales person costs  and sales management costs 
in  we incurred additional marketing and advertising costs of million  compared to  to support both the spa and sbc businesses 
advertising expense for the year ended december  includes million of advertising costs that pertain to partially offsetting these cost increases  net publishing and information technology costs were lower by approximately million in  primarily due to the elimination of duplicate facility and associated operational costs resulting from the integration of the spa acquisition 
the majority of these duplicative costs were eliminated in the second half of purchase accounting resulting from the sbc directory acquisition will continue to impact reported expenses in we expect operating expenses in to be significantly higher than in due to a full year of results from the acquired sbc directory business 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses in were million compared to million in  or an increase of million 
the primary components of the million increase in g a expenses in  compared to  were as follows change amounts in millions increased billing  credit and collection expenses related to the acquired sbc directory business other increased g a expenses  primarily related to the acquired sbc directory business expenses related to sarbanes oxley compliance in all other net changes to g a expenses decreased g a expenses in for relocation  severance and integration expenses related to the spa and sbc acquisitions and the corporate headquarters relocation total increase in g a  compared to the million increase in g a expenses was primary impacted by million of incremental g a expense to support the acquired sbc directory business 
this consisted of increased billing  credit and collection expenses of million and million of other g a expenses  including financial services  human resources and administration services 
g a expenses were also impacted by million of costs related to compliance with sarbanes oxley initiatives for which there were no comparable expenses in these increases were offset by million lower severance and relocation expenses associated with the spa and sbc directory acquisitions and expenses related to the relocation of the company s corporate headquarters in compared to we recorded million of expenses in related to the relocation of our corporate offices to cary  north carolina  compared to million in in  g a expenses also included million of acquisition and integration related costs from the sbc transaction 
more than offsetting those increased costs  included a million charge related to the shutdown of duplicative facilities resulting from the spa acquisition  compared to similar charges of only million in related to the relocation of sprint sales offices 
we expect g a expenses in to be significantly higher than due to a full year of results from the acquired sbc directory business 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization d a in was million compared to million in amortization of intangible assets was million in compared to million in the increase in amortization expense is due to the increase in intangible assets resulting from the sbc directory acquisition 
we expect amortization expense in to be significantly higher than due to a full year impact related to the intangible assets acquired in connection with the sbc directory acquisition 
depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of computer software was million in compared to million in this decrease is primarily due to the acceleration of depreciation on certain fixed assets and computer software acquired in connection with the spa acquisition in partnership income in and  partnership income related to our share of the net income of dontech accounted for under the equity method and revenue participation income from sbc 
as a sales agent for sbc  dontech earned commission revenue based on the annual value of local sales contracts executed during the period calendar sales 
we also earned revenue participation income from sbc based on the amount of dontech calendar sales during the period 
as a result of the sbc directory acquisition  sbc ceased paying us revenue participation income and we now consolidate all net profits in dontech 
thus  the dontech partnership investment was eliminated 
accordingly  commencing on september   we no longer report partnership income 
partnership income was million in  as compared to million in the decrease in partnership income in is primarily a result of no longer recognizing partnership income following the sbc directory acquisition 
operating income as a result of the sbc directory acquisition  the company now has one operating segment 
management views and evaluates this one segment as the sole source of ebitda and operating income for the company and does not need to allocate resources among different segments 
operating income for and was as follows for the years ended december  amounts in millions change total operating income in of million increased by million from operating income of million in the increase was due primarily to the effects of the spa acquisition and related purchase accounting on our revenues and expenses  as described above 
net revenue in of primarily resulting from the spa acquisition  was more than offset by the operating expenses in of million  also primarily as a result of the spa acquisition 
the primary reason that our costs relating to the acquired spa business increased more than our revenue in is because while all directory advertising revenue is deferred under our deferral and amortization method  only a portion of total costs related to publication of the directories are deferred under the deferral and amortization method 
therefore  under purchase accounting  when the entire balance of deferred revenue and deferred directory costs were eliminated at the time of the spa acquisition  it had a disproportionately higher impact on revenue than on expenses 
accordingly  after the adjustments required by purchase accounting  operating expenses in were disproportionately higher than the related revenue 
if the effects of purchase accounting were eliminated  adjusted operating income in would have been substantially higher and relatively proportional to net revenues 
see adjusted and pro forma amounts and other non gaap measures below 
additionally  for the reasons described above  partnership income decreased by million in while purchase accounting related to the sbc directory acquisition also negatively impacted results  because that transaction closed on september   its impact was not as material to results as purchase accounting related to the spa acquisition was to results 
purchase accounting from the sbc directory acquisition will continue to adversely impact reported results through additionally  we expect operating income to be significantly higher in than in due to a full year of results from the acquired sbc directory business 
interest expense  net net interest expense in was million compared to million in the decrease in net interest expense of million is a result of lower outstanding debt balances in the first eight months of combined with lower interest rates in most of than in this was partially offset by the substantial increase in debt incurred in connection with the sbc directory acquisition on september  the impact of interest expense associated with the additional borrowings used to finance the sbc directory acquisition is expected to be greater in due to the impact of such additional borrowings for the entire period 
interest expense in also includes a million charge resulting from the redemption in of the remaining senior subordinated notes due see liquidity and capital resources for a further description of our debt obligations and the provisions of the related debt instruments 
net interest expense for includes million of non cash amortization of deferred financing costs  compared to million of non cash amortization of deferred financing costs in other income expense  net in december  a charge of million was recorded to reclassify to earnings the cumulative change in the fair value of a swap that was previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet  due to the loss of hedge accounting treatment 
in  we recognized a corresponding gain of million as the swap matured in june see item a  qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk for additional information about our interest rate swap agreements 
provision benefit for income taxes the provision for income taxes of million was comprised of a current tax benefit of million and a deferred tax provision of million 
the current tax benefit was based on an effective tax rate of and net operating losses of approximately million related to tax deductions in connection with the spa acquisition and the sbc directory acquisition 
the deferred tax provision of million was primarily related to the difference in amortization expense recorded for tax purposes compared to book purposes with respect to the intangible assets acquired in connection with the spa acquisition and the sbc directory acquisition 
the remaining federal net operating loss carryforward of million will begin to expire in  and the remaining state net operating loss carryforwards of million will begin to expire in the tax benefit of million was comprised of a current tax provision million and a deferred tax benefit of million 
the tax benefit of million was based on an effective tax rate of and net operating losses of approximately million related to tax deductions in connection with the spa acquisition 
the deferred tax benefit was primarily related to the tax benefit recognized with respect to tax net operating loss generated in partially offset by a deferred tax provision related to the difference in amortization recorded for tax purposes compared to book purposes with respect to intangible assets acquired in connection with the spa acquisition 
net income loss  income loss available to common shareholders and earnings loss per share net income in was million compared to net loss of million in the results for were adversely affected by purchase accounting that precluded us from recognizing deferred revenue and certain expenses associated with those directories published prior to the spa acquisition  including all january published directories 
while purchase accounting related to the sbc directory acquisition also negatively impacted results  because that transaction closed on september   its impact was not as material to results as purchase accounting related to the spa acquisition was to results 
purchase accounting from the sbc directory acquisition will continue to adversely impact reported results through the dividend on our redeemable convertible cumulative preferred stock preferred stock reduces net income or increases net loss  resulting in income loss available to common shareholders from which earnings per share amounts are calculated 
the amount of the preferred stock dividend includes the stated dividend  plus a deemed dividend for a beneficial conversion feature bcf 
the bcf is a function of the conversion price of the preferred stock  the fair value of the related warrants issued with the preferred stock and the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of issuance of the preferred stock 
in connection with the issuance of our preferred stock and each subsequent quarterly accrued dividend  a bcf has been recorded because the fair value of the underlying common stock at the time of issuance of the preferred stock was greater than the conversion price of the preferred stock 
the full amount of the bcf is treated as a deemed dividend because the preferred stock was convertible into common stock immediately after issuance in january the preferred stock dividend in and of million and million  respectively  consisted of the stated dividend of million and million  respectively  and a bcf of million and million  respectively 
the bcf recorded in was more significant than bcf amounts recorded in subsequent periods  reflecting the issuance of the preferred stock and related warrants in january the resulting income loss available to common shareholders was million in as compared to million in in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a final consensus on eitf issue no 
 participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement eitf  which established standards regarding the computation of earnings per share eps by companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends and earnings of the company 
eitf was effective for interim periods ending june  for calendar year companies 
we adopted the provisions of eitf during the first quarter of eitf requires earnings available to common shareholders for the period  after deduction of preferred stock dividends  to be allocated between the common and preferred shareholders based on their respective rights to receive dividends 
basic eps is then calculated by dividing income loss allocable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding 
eitf does not require the presentation of basic and diluted eps for securities other than common stock  therefore  the following eps amounts only pertain to our common stock 
under the guidance of eitf  diluted eps are calculated by dividing income loss allocable to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding plus dilutive potential common stock 
potential common stock includes stock options and warrants  the dilutive effect of which is calculated using the treasury stock method  and preferred stock  the dilutive effect of which is calculated using the if converted method 
the calculation of basic and diluted eps for the years ended december  and are presented below 
for the years ended december  basic eps two class method income loss available to common shareholders amount allocable to common shareholders income loss allocable to common shareholders weighted average common shares outstanding basic earnings loss per share two class method diluted eps income loss available to common shareholders amount allocable to common shares income loss allocable to common shareholders weighted average common shares outstanding dilutive effect of stock options dilutive effect of preferred stock assuming conversion weighted average diluted shares outstanding diluted earnings loss per share    for the year ended december  in computing basic eps using the two class method  we have not allocated the loss available to common shareholders in the year ended december  between common and preferred shareholders since the preferred shareholders do not have a contractual obligation to share in the net loss 
stock options in and the assumed conversion of the preferred stock into  and  shares of our common stock in and  respectively  were anti dilutive and therefore are not included in the calculation of diluted eps 
these eps amounts differ from those reported in our current report on form k filed with the sec on february  resulting from an update to the two class method used to compute earnings per share 
adjusted and pro forma amounts and other non gaap measures as a result of the sbc directory acquisition and the spa acquisition  the related financings and associated purchase accounting  our reported gaap results are not comparable to our reported gaap results 
additionally  these considerations with respect to the sbc directory acquisition will also affect the comparability of our and reported gaap results 
under the deferral and amortization method of revenue recognition  the billable value of directories published is recognized as revenue in subsequent reporting periods 
however  purchase accounting precluded us from recognizing directory revenue and certain expenses associated with directories that published prior to each acquisition  including all directories published in the month each acquisition was completed 
thus  our reported and gaap results are not indicative of our underlying operating and financial performance 
accordingly  management is presenting adjusted pro forma information that  among other things  eliminates the purchase accounting impact on revenue and expenses for each acquisition and assumes the sbc directory acquisition and related financing occurred at the beginning of management believes that the presentation of this adjusted pro forma information will help financial statement users better and more easily compare current period underlying operating results against what the combined company performance would more likely have been in the comparable prior period 
all of the adjusted pro forma amounts disclosed below or elsewhere are non gaap measures  which are reconciled to the most comparable gaap measures below 
while we believe the adjusted pro forma results reasonably represent results as if the businesses had been combined for the full years and  because of differences in the application of accounting policies and practices between the company and the acquired entities  management does not believe these adjusted pro forma amounts are strictly comparable  nor are they necessarily indicative of results for future periods

total adjusted pro forma net revenue in was  million  an increase of million or from adjusted pro forma net revenue of  million in under the deferral and amortization method of revenue recognition  revenue from directory advertising sales is initially deferred when a directory is published and recognized ratably over the life of the directory  which is typically months 
the modest decrease in adjusted gross directory advertising revenue is a result of higher revenue from sprint directories  particularly in nevada and florida  offset by a decline in revenue from the sbc directories due to the past declines in publication sales amortizing to revenue in current periods 
due to the deferral and amortization method  the billable value of published directories are amortized to revenue over the life of the directory  which delays recognition of publication sales as recorded revenue on a gaap basis 
the reduction in sales claims and allowances is primarily the result of a million favorable reduction of claims allowances recognized by sbc prior to the sbc directory acquisition due to improved experience

additionally  in the sbc directory business recorded million of allocations for corporate related administration costs that are not included in expenses due to the sbc directory acquisition 
print and paper costs for sbc branded directories were million lower in  compared to  due to lower print volumes 
adjusted pro forma expenses for relocation  severance and integration costs were million lower in compared to adjusted pro forma expenses in included million related to the relocation of our corporate offices to cary  north carolina  compared to million in adjusted pro forma expenses also included million of acquisition and integration related costs from the sbc transaction 
more than offsetting those increased costs  adjusted pro forma expenses included a million charge related to the shutdown of duplicative facilities that resulted from the spa acquisition  compared to similar charges of only million in related to the relocation of sprint sales offices 
offsetting these lower expenses is a million adjustment resulting in lower operating expense in  compared to  due to the elimination in our consolidated adjusted pro forma results of sales agency expense paid by sbc that dontech recorded as revenue 
sbc deferred this expense and recognized it over the life of the publications to which it related 
dontech recorded the revenue as period revenue 
the resulting timing difference is due to different accounting treatment between sbc and dontech and resulted in a net reduction of operating expense of million to eliminate the sales agency expense from pro forma adjusted expenses 
additionally  adjusted pro forma sales expenses were million higher than  primarily due to better sales performance of the sprint directories in certain larger markets 
sarbanes oxley compliance during also resulted in approximately million of expenses  with no corresponding expense in we expect adjusted operating and g a expenses to be higher in than adjusted pro forma operating and g a expenses in due to increased investments in online directories and other digital initiatives  increased advertising and promotional activities in illinois  and the expected adoption of sfas r  which will increase compensation expense in adjusted pro forma depreciation and amortization d a in was million compared to million in depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of computer software was lower in by million due to the acceleration of depreciation on certain fixed assets and computer software acquired in connection with the spa acquisition in adjusted pro forma operating income in was million  an increase of million or from adjusted pro forma operating income in of million  reflecting the above expense decreases 
advertising sales publication sales management reviews and evaluates the value of advertising sales in directories that published during the period publication sales as its primary sales performance measure 
management believes that a comparison of publication sales for the same directories from one period to the next gives a better indication of underlying sales trends  economic conditions and business confidence than a comparison of directory revenue recognized using the deferral and amortization method 
because we recognize directory revenue ratably over the life of a directory under the deferral and amortization  the amount of revenue recognized during a period is not directly related to the sales trends  economic conditions and business confidence during that period 
publication sales are similar to a same store sales measure 
if events occur during the current period that affect the comparability of publication sales to the prior year period  such as changes in directory publication dates  then prior year publication sales amounts are adjusted to conform to the current period presentation 
publication sales from sprint branded directories in were million  up million or from publication sales of million in publication sales from sbc branded directories in were million  down from publication sales of million in the increase in sprint branded publication sales resulted from higher recurring advertising in our major sprint markets for directories published in these results were partially offset by weaker performance in certain smaller sprint markets 
the decrease in sbc branded publication sales resulted from continued softness in the chicago area economy and less than optimal execution and investment in the sbc directory business as a result of the dontech structure prior to the sbc directory acquisition 
due to the timing of the sales campaign cycles that determine publication sales  substantially all sbc branded publication sales  and a substantial portion of first quarter sbc branded publication sales  were completed prior to the sbc directory acquisition 
publication sales are a non gaap measure for which the most comparable gaap measure is net revenue 
a reconciliation of publication sales to net revenue reported in accordance with gaap is presented below for the years ended december  amount in millions publication sales sprint branded directories publication sales sprint branded directories percentage change over prior year adjustments for changes in directory publication date s publication sales previously disclosed publication sales sbc branded directories publication sales sbc branded directories percentage change over prior year less pre acquisition publication sales for sprint branded directories not recognized as revenue in the current period due to purchase accounting less pre acquisition publication sales for sbc branded directories not recognized as revenue in current period due to purchase accounting less current period publication sales for sprint branded directories not recognized as revenue in current period due to the deferral method of accounting less current period publication sales for sbc branded directories not recognized as revenue in current period due to the deferral method of accounting plus net revenue reported in the period for publication sales from prior periods net directory advertising revenue on above publication sales pre press publishing revenue other revenue net revenue gaap year ended december  compared to the year ended december  factors affecting comparability spa acquisition because of the spa acquisition  the related financing and associated accounting  our results prepared in accordance with gaap are not comparable to our gaap results previously reported 
also  because purchase accounting rules precluded us from recognizing revenue and certain expenses for those directories that published prior to the acquisition  including all january published directories  revenue and certain expenses reported in are not representative of revenue and certain expenses that would have been reported in absent these purchase accounting adjustments 
accordingly  in addition to a discussion of the reported gaap results compared to the reported gaap results  we are also providing a comparison of adjusted results  which  among other things  exclude the effect of purchase accounting on deferred revenue and certain expenses  to adjusted pro forma results  which assumes the acquisition occurred on january  for a detailed discussion of adjusted revenue and certain expenses versus adjusted pro forma revenue and certain expenses  which are more comparable to each other  as well as a detailed discussion of advertising sales  which drive revenue  see adjusted and pro forma amounts and other non gaap measures below

net revenue the components of our net revenue in and were as follows for the years ended december  amounts in millions change directory advertising revenue advertising sales commission revenue sales allowances net revenue pre press publishing fees other revenue total revenue was derived entirely from our donnelley segment since dontech was accounted for under the equity method 
subsequent to the spa acquisition  revenue from directory advertising sales is recognized under the deferral and amortization method  whereby revenue from advertising sales is initially deferred when the directory is published and recognized ratably over the directory s life  which is typically months 
pre press publishing fees and other revenue were recognized when earned 
total net revenue in was million compared to million in the increase in total net revenue in was a result of the spa acquisition 
from the date of the acquisition on january   our revenue was earned primarily from the sale of advertising in yellow pages directories we published in  totaling million  net of sales allowances 
as a result of the acquisition  we became the publisher of sprint branded directories 
as the publisher  we earn the entire value of the sales contract with the advertiser  subject to an allowance for sales claims 
prior to the acquisition  we were a sales agent and earned only a commission on the advertising sales contract that was recognized when the advertiser signed the contract and we earned this revenue on directories as opposed to the directories we published in during  our net revenue represented only the commissions we earned as a sales agent on advertising sales made on behalf of spa  totaling million  net of allowances for sales claims 
revenue from pre press publishing services was million in compared to million in the decrease of million is primarily due to the consolidation of spa s operating results with ours beginning in and the expiration of a contract with a third party directory publisher that ceased outsourcing its pre press publishing services to us in the first quarter of during  we earned million in fees for pre press services provided to spa and earned million from that third party pre press publishing contract that expired 
we continued to provide transition services to the third party publisher through march and recognized million of revenue in other revenue in and included fees for sales related computer application services rendered to dontech on behalf of sbc 
as a result of the spa acquisition in  we also began recording revenue for late fees paid on outstanding customer balances  sales of directories and fees from telephone companies for publishing of information pages 
these activities accounted for the difference in other revenue between and expenses the components of our total expenses for and were as follows for the years ended december  amounts in millions change operating expenses g a expenses d a expense total all reported expenses are derived entirely from our donnelley segment since dontech is accounted for under the equity method 
certain costs directly related to the selling and production of directories are initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the directory 
operating expenses total operating expenses in were million compared to million in the increase in operating expenses was primarily a result of the operating expenses of the spa business that we acquired 
the operating expenses included our results as a publisher of directories  whereas expenses included those expenses incurred in our prior role as a sales agent for directories 
the expenses we incur as a publisher of directories are significantly greater than the expenses that we incurred as a sales agent 
however  due to the elimination of spa s deferred revenue and deferred costs for and january directories as required by purchase accounting  our reported expenses in do not include certain expenses associated with those directories 
therefore  our operating expenses prospectively will be higher than they were in in addition  our direct sales costs in were million higher than in due to an increase in the number of sales offices  size of our local sales force and our national sales operations 
as a publisher  we also now incur costs related to the printing and distribution of directories  purchasing of paper  and marketing  advertising and customer service that we did not incur when we were a sales agent in expenses in for these functions were million higher than in publishing and information technology expenses in were million higher than in due to the production of the additional spa directories related to the acquisition and the larger workforce 
bad debt expense in was lower than in principally due to better than expected collections as a result of significant process improvements in billings and collections  partially offset by bad debt expense recognized as a publisher 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses in were million compared to million in the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to incremental costs related to the former spa business of million  costs relating to the relocation of our corporate offices to cary  north carolina of million and the higher corporate costs for the larger organization of million due to higher insurance premiums  compensation and governance costs 
in addition  expenses included million of costs related to the consolidation of our publishing and technology operations  sales offices and administrative staff 
general and administrative expenses in reflect a net benefit of million from the reversal of remaining restructuring reserves initially recorded in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization d a in was million compared to million in the increase in is primarily a result of the amortization  totaling million  of the intangible assets acquired in the spa acquisition 
in  donnelley did not have significant intangible assets and therefore did not incur significant amortization expense 
depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of computer software was million in and million in this increase is primarily due to the acceleration of depreciation on certain fixed assets acquired in the spa acquisition 
partnership income partnership income in included our share of the net income of dontech accounted for under the equity method and revenue participation income from sbc 
as a sales agent for sbc  dontech earned commission revenue based on the annual value of sales contracts executed during the period calendar sales 
we also earn revenue participation income based on the amount of calendar sales during the period 
partnership income in also included a priority distribution on our membership interest in cendon  llc cendon 
as a result of the spa acquisition  we acquired the remaining membership interests in cendon and accordingly  became the sole owner of cendon 
we no longer receive priority distribution income  rather results from cendon have been included in our consolidated statements of operations 
partnership income was million in as compared to million in  of which million was from dontech and million was priority distribution income from cendon  which at the time was a part of our das segment 
the decrease in partnership income from dontech was due to a slow economic recovery  stagnant job growth and competitive local media environment in the chicagoland markets 
operating income operating income by segment for the years ended december  and was as follows for the years ended december  amounts in millions donnelley dontech total reported operating income in of million decreased million from operating income of million in the decrease was due primarily to the effects of the spa acquisition and related purchase accounting on our revenues and expenses  as described above 
while net revenue increased in by million over net revenue  primarily resulting from the spa acquisition  more than offsetting that increase in net revenue was an increase in operating expenses in of million  also primarily as a result of the spa acquisition 
the primary reason that our costs relating to the acquired business increased more in than our revenues is because while all directory advertising revenue is deferred under our deferral and amortization method  only a portion of total costs related to publication of the directories are deferred under the deferral and amortization method 
therefore  under purchase accounting  when the entire balance of deferred revenue and deferred directory costs were eliminated at the time of the spa acquisition  it had a disproportionately higher impact on revenues than it did on expenses 
accordingly  after the adjustments required by purchase accounting  operating expenses in were disproportionately higher than the related revenue 
if the effects of purchase accounting were eliminated  adjusted operating income in would have been substantially higher and relatively proportional to the increase in net revenues compared to gaap operating income in see adjusted and pro forma amounts and other non gaap measures below 
additionally  the acquired spa business also resulted in increased general and administrative costs of million and depreciation and amortization of million in compared to  including the amortization of the acquired intangible assets 
also contributing to the lower operating income in compared to is the decrease in partnership income described above 
interest expense  net net interest expense in was million compared to million in interest expense in was significantly higher as a result of the substantial debt incurred in connection with the spa acquisition 
see liquidity and capital resources for a further description of our debt obligations and the provisions of the related debt instruments 
interest expense for includes million of non cash amortization of deferred financing costs  consisting of million in deferred costs that were expensed in connection with pre acquisition debt that was extinguished in and million of amortized deferred costs related to our current outstanding debt  of which million related to accelerated principal payments in net interest expense in of million included million of interest incurred on  million in debt raised in contemplation of the spa acquisition 
excluding this amount  interest expense was million reflective of our outstanding pre acquisition debt during other income expense  net other income in represents a million gain on hedging activities 
at december   our million notional value interest rate swap did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment due to the then pending repayment of existing variable rate debt in connection with the spa acquisition 
in december  a charge of million was recorded to reclassify to earnings the cumulative change in the fair value of the swap that was previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet 
due to the loss of hedge accounting treatment  a gain of million was recognized in earnings in at the time the swap matured 
other expense in consists of the million charge related to the interest rate swap agreement  net of a million reversal of remaining reserves related to the disposition of businesses in see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information about our interest rate swap agreements 
benefit provision for income taxes the tax benefit is based on an effective tax rate of and results from the tax benefit generated in attributable to a net operating loss of approximately million related to tax deductions in connection with the spa acquisition 
the effective tax rate reflects an increase in the state and local tax rate as a result of the spa acquisition  combined with the favorable settlement in of certain prior year state and local tax audits 
the tax provision is based on an effective tax rate of  which was adversely impacted by the chinabig investment impairment charge that was not deductible for tax purposes 
this charge represents a capital loss  which can only be offset against capital gains 
this charge also gave rise to a deferred tax asset that can only be realized by offsetting future capital gains 
given our current business portfolio and projections of future results  we believe that the probability of generating future capital gains to realize this asset is remote 
accordingly  a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to the chinabig investment was established 
net loss income  loss income available to common shareholders and loss earnings per share the net loss in was million compared to net income of million in our operating results for reflect lower operating income as described previously and higher interest expense and d a as a result of the spa acquisition 
the dividend on the preferred stock increases the net loss or reduces net income  resulting in loss income available to common shareholders from which earnings per share amounts are calculated 
the amount of the preferred stock dividend includes the stated dividend  plus a deemed dividend for a beneficial conversion feature bcf 
the bcf is a function of the conversion price of the preferred stock  the fair value of the warrants issued with the preferred stock weighted average of per warrant based on the black scholes model and exercise prices of for the warrants issued in november and for the warrants issued in january  and the fair market value of the common stock on january   the date the preferred stock was issued 
the full amount of the bcf is treated as a deemed dividend because the preferred stock was convertible into common stock immediately after issuance in november and january the preferred stock dividend in and of million and million  respectively  consisted of the stated dividend of million and million  respectively  and a bcf of million and million  respectively 
the resulting loss income available to common shareholders was million and million in and  respectively 
basic earnings per common share eps are generally calculated by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding 
however  because our preferred stock contains certain participation rights  eitf topic d  effect of participating securities on the computation of basic earnings per share topic d  requires that the dilutive effect of those securities be included in the weighted average number of shares outstanding 
furthermore  topic d requires that the dilutive effect to be included in basic eps may be calculated using either the if converted method or the two class method 
however  the dilutive effect of the preferred stock cannot be less than that which would result from the application of the two class method 
we have elected to use the if converted method in calculating basic eps 
however  during  we reported eps calculated using the two class method because it was less than eps calculated using the if converted method 
diluted eps equals income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding plus common share equivalents 
common share equivalents include stock options and warrants  the dilutive effect of which is calculated using the treasury stock method  and preferred stock  the potential dilutive effect of which is calculated using the if converted method 
the calculation of basic and diluted eps for and is presented below for the years ended december  in thousands  except per share data basic eps if converted method loss income available to common shareholders preferred stock dividend net loss income weighted average common shares outstanding weighted average common shares assuming conversion of preferred stock weighted average common equivalent shares assuming conversion of preferred stock basic loss earnings per share if converted method basic eps two class method loss income available to common shareholders amount allocable to common shares rights to undistributed loss income weighted average common shares outstanding basic loss earnings per share two class method diluted eps loss income available to common shareholders weighted average common shares outstanding dilutive effect of stock options dilutive effect of preferred stock assuming conversion weighted average diluted shares outstanding diluted loss earnings per share at december   the preferred stock was convertible into  shares of common stock 
however  since million of the preferred stock was issued in november  the number of common share equivalents included in the eps calculation has been weighted for the actual time the preferred stock was outstanding during the year 
 for the year ended december  basic eps calculated under the two class method was a loss of for the year ended december  however  where there is a net loss in a period  the application of the two class method is anti dilutive 
accordingly  reported basic eps are calculated as loss available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding 
stock options in and the assumed conversion of the preferred stock in and into  and  shares of our common stock were anti dilutive and therefore are not included in the calculation of diluted eps 
adjusted and pro forma amounts and other non gaap measures as a result of the spa acquisition  our results prepared in accordance with gaap are not comparable to our reported gaap results 
under our deferral and amortization revenue recognition method  certain directories published in would have been recognized as revenue in however  purchase accounting considerations precluded us from recognizing directory revenue and certain expenses associated with directories that published prior to the acquisition  including all january published directories 
accordingly  our reported gaap results are not indicative of our underlying operations and financial performance 
accordingly  management is presenting adjusted results for that  among other things  eliminate the purchase accounting impact on revenue and certain expenses and adjusted pro forma information for that assumes the acquisition and related financing occurred on january  management believes that the presentation of this adjusted and adjusted pro forma information will help readers better and more easily compare current period underlying operating results against what the combined company performance would likely have been in the comparable prior period 
all of the following adjusted and pro forma amounts are non gaap measures  which are reconciled to the most comparable gaap measures below

the increase in adjusted gross directory advertising revenue is a result of higher advertiser renewal rates and solid performance in two of our major markets  nevada and southwest florida  offset by weaker performance in military markets due to the iraqi conflict and generally weak regional economic conditions during much of the year 
in addition  due to the deferral and amortization method  sales growth in published directories are amortized to revenue over the life of the directory  which delays recognition of publication sales as recorded revenue 
the reduction in sales claims and allowances is a result of improved processes between the sales organization and pre press services

the decrease in adjusted expenses in is primarily due to lower bad debt expense of million resulting from better than expected collections due to certain process improvements  synergy savings from the combination of the spa operations with donnelley s in of million  and lower print  paper and distribution costs of million due to lower paper prices  printing expenses and vendor costs 
these decreases were offset by million in increased corporate costs  due to higher insurance premiums  compensation and governance costs related to the larger organization  million of costs to achieve synergies from the consolidation of our publishing and technology operations  sales offices and administrative functions  million related to the headquarters relocation and million due to increased advertising in order to bring advertising levels for the sprint branded directories back to historical levels before adjusted partnership income in was million  a decrease of million or from adjusted pro forma partnership income in of million 
the decrease in partnership income reflects the decrease in income from dontech previously discussed 
adjusted operating income in was million  an increase of million or from adjusted pro forma operating income in of million 
donnelley advertising sales publication sales management reviews and evaluates the value of advertising sales in directories that published during the period publication sales as its primary sales performance measure 
directory advertising revenue is driven by publication sales 
management believes that a comparison of publication sales for the same directories from one period to another gives a better indication of underlying sales trends  economic conditions and business confidence than a comparison of directory revenue recognized using the deferral and amortization method 
because we recognize directory revenue ratably over the life of a directory  the amount of revenue recognized during a period is not directly related to the sales trends  economic conditions and business confidence during that period 
publication sales are comparable to a same store sales measure and are utilized and disclosed by many directory publishers  thus facilitating comparison of sales performance among publishers 
publication sales in for the donnelley segment were million  up million or from pro forma publication sales for the donnelley segment of million in the increase in publication sales resulted from higher advertiser renewal rates and solid performance in two of our major markets  nevada and southwest florida 
these results were partially offset by regional economic weakness  and weaker performance in several military markets due to troop deployment in connection with the iraqi conflict 
publication sales are a non gaap measure for which the most comparable gaap measure related to the donnelley segment is net revenue 
a reconciliation of publication sales to net revenue reported in accordance with gaap is presented below for the years ended december  amounts in millions publication sales donnelley segment less publication sales for january directories not recognized as revenue due to purchase accounting less current period publication sales deferred and not recognized as revenue in current period less publication sales for those spa directories not sold by donnelley for the years ended december  amounts in millions publication sales reported by donnelley in less sales contracts executed in prior periods and reported as calendar sales in prior periods plus contracts executed during the period to be reported as publication sales in future periods calendar sales in net directory advertising revenue on above advertising sales plus net commission revenue on calendar sales plus pre press publishing revenue plus other revenue net revenue gaap dontech advertising sales calendar and publication sales calendar sales as a sales agent for sbc  dontech recognizes commission revenue based on the annual value of a sales contract calendar sales in the period the contract is executed 
management reviews calendar sales for dontech because this is a primary driver of our income from dontech 
dontech manages the sale of advertising to customers on a directory by directory basis or project basis a project consists of two or more directories in a geographic area and organizes the sales into directories as a sales campaign 
accordingly  changes in the beginning and ending dates of a sales campaign and the actual sales recorded at any point during the campaign can vary from one period to the next 
these variations  or timing factors  can cause calendar sales  and thus partnership income  to be materially different from the prior comparative period 
income from dontech consisted of the following for the years ended december  amounts in millions share of dontech net profits revenue participation income total dontech income dontech partnership income in of million decreased million or from million in  mainly due to lower calendar sales 
dontech calendar sales in were million  lower than calendar sales in of million  as a result of a continued weak economy in the midwest during and competition in the local media market 
our share of dontech s net income decreased million from million to million 
in addition  revenue participation income received from sbc decreased million or to million in from million in each of these decreases is a direct result of the reduction in dontech s calendar sales from which our share of dontech s net income and revenue participation is derived 
publication sales management also utilizes publication sales to evaluate the sales performance of dontech because management believes that this measure provides a better indication of underlying sales trends  economic conditions and business confidence in the dontech markets than a comparison of partnership income from dontech 
publication sales at dontech represent the annual billing value of the sbc directories published during the period for which dontech sells advertising 
publication sales in were million  down million or from publication sales of million 
this decrease is a result of a continued weak economy in the midwest  stagnant job growth and competition in the local media market 
calendar sales and publication sales are non gaap measures for which the most comparable gaap measures related to dontech is partnership income 
a reconciliation of publication sales and calendar sales to partnership income is provided below 
for the years ended december  amounts in millions dontech publication sales less the value of contracts executed and reported as calendar sales in prior periods plus the value of contracts executed during the period to be reported as publication sales in future periods dontech calendar sales commission revenue from above calendar sales partnership net expenses partnership profit donnelley s share of partnership profits revenue participation income on above calendar sales total income from dontech priority distribution income from cendon partnership income gaap liquidity and capital resources our senior secured credit facility  as amended and restated on september  in connection with the sbc directory acquisition  consisted of a million term loan a  a  million term loan b and a million revolving credit facility revolver for an aggregate facility of  million collectively  the credit facility 
the credit facility provides for a new term loan c for potential borrowings up to million  such proceeds  if borrowed  to be used to fund acquisitions  for retirement of notes  and for redemption of  and payment of dividends on  the preferred stock  subject to certain limitations 
substantially all of our assets  including the capital stock of our subsidiaries  are pledged to collateralize our obligations under the credit facility and the senior notes 
in connection with the sbc directory acquisition  we borrowed an additional  million by increasing our existing term loan a to million from million and increasing our existing term loan b to  million from million 
our revolver was increased to million from million 
proceeds from the credit facility were used to acquire the sbc directory business and pay related fees and expenses 
no borrowing was made under the revolver to fund the sbc directory acquisition 
the sources and uses of funds in connection with the sbc directory acquisition are summarized as follows amounts in millions sources proceeds from the credit facility available cash total sources uses purchase price net direct acquisition costs financing costs total uses on december   we amended our credit facility to accomplish the following objectives obtain more favorable pricing on our variable rate debt  adjust non financial covenants to make them less restrictive for corporate operating flexibility  and obtain consent to carve out designated additional debt from required mandatory prepayments 
this amendment to our credit facility created a new term loan a and a new term loan d  both replacing the term loan b term loans a  a and d require quarterly principal payments 
as of december   the outstanding balances of term loans a  a and d were million  million and  million  respectively  and million was outstanding under the revolver 
the revolver  term loan a and term loan a mature in december  and term loan d matures in june both the september  and december  amendments to the credit facility were accounted for as modifications of the underlying debt instruments 
the weighted average interest rate of outstanding debt under the credit facility was at december  and was under the former term facilities at december  the increase in the weighted average interest rate primarily reflects the increase in the libor rate during  partially offset by lower pricing on our variable rate debt 
our credit facility bears interest  at our option  at either the higher of i a base rate as determined by the administrative agent  deutsche bank trust company americas  plus a margin on the revolver and term loan a and a margin on term loan a and term loan d  and ii the federal funds effective rate as defined plus  plus a margin on the revolver and term loan a and a margin on term loan a and term loan d  or libor rate plus a margin on the revolver and term loan a and a margin on term loan a and term loan d 
we may elect interest periods of     or months for libor borrowings 
the effective interest rate on the credit facility  including the interest rate swaps  during the twelve months ended december  was we have also outstanding million of senior notes and million of senior subordinated notes issued in connection with the spa acquisition 
interest is paid on these notes semi annually on june and december the senior notes became secured in conjunction with the amendment and restatement of the credit facility in connection with the sbc directory acquisition 
in connection with the spa acquisition  we also issued  shares of our preferred stock to the gs funds for gross proceeds of million  which were used to finance the acquisition 
these shares are convertible at any time at a price of and earn a cumulative dividend of compounded quarterly 
only with the consent of a majority of the holders of the preferred stock may we pay any dividends in cash prior to october  subsequent to october   dividends on the preferred stock may be paid in cash  subject to any limitations under the credit facility  or allowed to accrete  at our option 
the credit facility may significantly limit our ability to pay the dividends on the preferred stock in cash 
in connection with the issuance of the preferred stock  we issued warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock with exercise prices of and  which may be exercised at any time before they expire on january  we intend to issue treasury stock to satisfy any conversion of the preferred sock and exercise of warrants 
we may redeem the preferred stock in cash at any time on or after january  if the market price as defined of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for of consecutive trading days 
the preferred stock is redeemable in cash by us at any time on or after january  the preferred stock is redeemable in cash at the option of the gs funds in the event of a change in control as defined 
at december   the liquidation value of the preferred stock was approximately million and such preferred stock was convertible into approximately million shares of our common stock 
except in the case of a change in control as defined  the redemption price of the preferred stock at any time is the greater of the liquidation value of the preferred stock or the market value of the preferred stock on an as converted basis at that time 
on january   we repurchased approximately of our outstanding preferred stock from the gs funds for million 
in order to fund this repurchase  on january   we issued million of the holdco notes in a private transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of the holdco notes bear interest of per annum and will be payable semi annually in arrears on january and july of each year  commencing july  the holdco notes are unsecured senior obligations of the company and mature on january  we entered into a registration rights agreement  whereby we agreed  among other things to file an exchange offer registration statement with the sec with respect to the holdco notes within days after january   ii use reasonable efforts to have such exchange offer registration statement declared effective by the sec within days after january  and iii subject to certain limitations  consummate the exchange offer to which the exchange offer registration statement relates within days after january  the remaining preferred stock that was not repurchased was convertible into approximately million shares of our common stock as of march  the credit facility and the indentures governing the notes and the agreements relating to the preferred stock contain usual and customary negative covenants that  among other things  place limitations on our ability to i incur additional indebtedness  including capital leases and liens  ii pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock  iii enter into mergers  consolidations  acquisitions  asset dispositions and sale leaseback transactions  iv make capital expenditures  v issue capital stock of our subsidiaries  and vi engage in transactions with our affiliates 
the credit facility also contains financial covenants relating to maximum consolidated leverage  minimum interest coverage and maximum senior secured leverage as defined therein 
as a result of the sbc directory acquisition  the spa acquisition and the repurchase of the preferred stock  we have a significant amount of debt  requiring significant debt service 
aggregate outstanding debt as of december  was  million and  following the issuance in january of million of the holdco notes in connection with the repurchase of the preferred stock  our aggregate outstanding debt as of january  was  million 
during the twelve months ended december   we made scheduled principal payments of million and prepaid an additional million in principal under our credit facility 
these principal payments were offset by a million increase in revolver borrowings under our credit facility 
during  we also redeemed the remaining million amount of pre acquisition subordinated notes 
for the year ended december   we made aggregate cash interest payments of million 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents before checks not yet presented for payment of million  and available borrowings under the revolver of million 
during  we periodically utilized the revolver as a financing resource to balance the timing of our periodic and accelerated payments made under the credit facility and interest payments on the senior notes and senior subordinated notes with the timing of cash receipts from operations 
our present intention is to repay borrowings on the revolver in a timely manner and keep any outstanding amounts to a minimum 
our primary source of liquidity will continue to be cash flows from operations as well as available borrowing capacity under the revolver 
we expect our primary liquidity requirement will be to fund operations and for principal and interest payments on our debt 
our ability to meet our debt service requirements will depend on our ability to generate cash flow in the future 
our primary sources of cash flow will consist mainly of cash receipts from the sale of advertising in our yellow pages directories and can be impacted by  among other factors  general economic conditions  competition from other yellow pages directory publishers and other alternative products  consumer confidence and the level of demand for yellow pages advertising 
we believe that cash flows from operations  along with borrowing capacity under the revolver  will be adequate to fund our operations and capital expenditures and to meet our debt service requirements for at least the next to months 
however  we make no assurances that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that sufficient borrowing will be available under the revolver or term loan c to enable us to fund our operations  capital expenditures and meet all debt service requirements  pursue all of our strategic initiatives  or for other purposes 
cash flow provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  key contributors to operating cash flow in include the following million in net income 
million of net non cash charges primarily consisting of million of depreciation and amortization  million in bad debt provision  million in other non cash charges and million in deferred taxes 
million net source of cash from a million increase in deferred directory revenue offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million 
we analyze the change in deferred revenue and accounts receivable together because when a directory is published  the annual billing value of that directory is initially deferred and unbilled accounts receivable are established 
each month thereafter  typically one twelfth of the billing value is recognized as revenue and billed to customers 
in connection with the sbc directory acquisition  while we did not record the unrecognized revenue for directories published prior to the acquisition and during september due to purchase accounting  we did acquire the associated unbilled receivables and the rights to bill and collect these receivables  which totaled approximately million 
million net use of cash from an increase in other assets reflecting an million increase in deferred directory costs  offset by a decrease of million in other current and non current assets 
deferred directory costs represent cash payments for certain costs associated with the publication of directories 
since deferred directory costs are initially deferred when incurred  the cash payments are made prior to the expense being recognized 
million net source of cash from an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  reflecting a million increase in accrued interest payable on outstanding debt and a decrease of million for federal income tax refunds received 
additionally  accounts payable and accrued liabilities includes a million advance from sbc under the transition services agreement relating to the accounts receivable billing and collection services  offset by the timing of invoices received as compared to invoices paid during the year ended december  million net source of cash from an increase in other non current liabilities reflecting a million tax refund that pertained to the company s election to carryback a federal net operating loss in connection with the spa acquisition 
cash flow from operations reflects the normal operations of the business and excludes the impact of the incremental assets and liabilities acquired as a result of the sbc directory acquisition on september   which impact is reflected in cash flow from investing activities 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was  million and includes the following  million in cash payments in connection with the sbc directory acquisition 
million used to purchase fixed assets  primarily computer equipment  software and leasehold improvements 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  million and includes the following  million in net borrowings under the credit facility consisting of million and million in borrowings under terms loans a and b  respectively  net of transaction costs of million 
the funds received under the credit facility were used to finance the sbc directory acquisition 
million in principal payments on debt borrowed under the credit facility 
of this amount  million represents scheduled principal payments  million represents principal payments made on an accelerated basis  at our option  from excess cash flow generated from operations  and million represents principal payments on the revolver 
million in principal payments to redeem the remaining senior subordinated notes due million in borrowings under the revolver 
million in the decreased value of checks not yet presented for payment 
million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
cash provided by operating activities in was million 
key contributors to cash flows from operating activities in include the following million source of cash resulting from a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in deferred directory revenue 
we analyze the change in deferred revenue and accounts receivable together because when a directory is published  the annual billing value of that directory is initially deferred and unbilled accounts receivable are established 
each month thereafter  one twelfth of the billing value is recognized as revenue and billed to customers 
in connection with the spa acquisition  while we did not record the unrecognized revenue for directories published prior to the acquisition and during january due to purchase accounting  we did acquire the associated unbilled receivables and the rights to bill and collect these receivables  which totaled approximately million 
other components adding to cash provided by operating activities include lower bad debts and sales claims  as well as improvements in the collection of past due balances 
million source of cash due to cash received from partnerships in excess of recorded partnership income 
partnership income and related cash received in consisted of our interest in dontech s net income and the revenue participation income from sbc 
we received cash from dontech and sbc subsequent to the time we record the associated partnership income  therefore  in periods of declining dontech partnership income  cash received related to prior periods will exceed the income recognized from the current period 
partially offsetting these sources of cash was the following use of cash million increase in other assets  primarily comprised of deferred directory costs 
deferred directory costs represent cash payments for certain costs associated with the publication of directories 
since deferred directory costs are initially deferred when incurred  the cash payments are made prior to the expense being recognized 
cash used in investing activities in was million and consists of the following  million in cash payments to acquire spa and pay transaction costs 
 million decrease in restricted cash that was recorded at december  this amount is comprised of funds that we received in the last quarter of that were placed in escrow pending the spa acquisition 
of this amount  million was raised from term loan b under the credit facility  million was raised from the notes and million in net proceeds was raised from the issuance of our preferred stock to the gs funds 
million was used to purchase fixed assets  primarily computer equipment and computer software 
cash provided by financing activities in was million and includes the following million in net borrowings under the million term loan a under the credit facility on january  the other funds raised under the credit facility to finance the spa acquisition and re finance existing debt were received in december and held in escrow until january  million in net proceeds from the issuance of our preferred stock with a stated value of million and related warrants to the gs funds on january  the gs funds invested a total stated amount of million in connection with the spa acquisition 
the initial investment of million was made in november million in principal payments on pre acquisition debt 
proceeds from our credit facility  notes and preferred stock were used in january to repay million in variable rate bank debt and redeem of senior subordinated notes pursuant to a tender offer 
million in principal payments on debt borrowed under the credit facility 
of this amount  million represents scheduled principal payments and million represents principal payments made on an accelerated basis  at our option  from excess cash flow generated from operations 
million in borrowings under the revolver 
million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
the contractual obligations table presented below sets forth our annual commitments as of december  for principal payments on our debt  as well as other cash obligations for the next five years and thereafter  plus the million of holdco notes we issued in january the debt repayments as presented in this table include only the scheduled principal payments under our current debt agreements and do not include any anticipated prepayments or interest charges 
payment due by period amounts in millions less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other long term liabilities transition services total contractual obligations included in long term debt are amounts owed under our credit facility and the notes 
the weighted average interest rate under the credit facility was at december  the senior notes and senior subordinated notes bear interest at and  respectively and the holdco notes bear interest at 
we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 
some lease agreements provide us with renewal or early termination options 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal or early termination options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
the amounts in the table assume we do not exercise any such renewal or early termination options 
we have unconditional purchase obligations with four vendors regarding the purchase of paper that expire at various times from december  through december  our purchase obligations are based on annual minimum quantities at pre established pricing 
amounts in the table above reflect such pricing and minimum quantities under this contract 
should the market price of the paper drop below the pre established pricing  our vendor is obligated to negotiate with us a lower paper price 
any quantities used above the contractual minimums would increase our payment obligations 
we have no contractual obligations beyond in connection with the sbc directory acquisition  we entered into a smartpages reseller agreement whereby we are obligated to pay to sbc million over the year term of the agreement 
we have a defined benefit plan covering substantially all employees 
our funding policy is to contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum legal funding requirement 
no contributions were required in the three year period ended december  based on past performance and the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be paid  if any  we have excluded such amounts from the above table 
we have an unfunded postretirement plan that provides certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to those full time employees who reach retirement age while working for the company 
those expected future benefit payments  including administrative expenses  net of employee contributions  are included in the table above 
additionally  we expect to make contributions of approximately million to our retirement and post retirement benefit plans in in connection with the sbc directory acquisition  we entered into a transition services agreement with sbc  whereby sbc would provide certain ongoing operational services  such as billing and collection services  on our behalf relating to the directory operations we acquired through the third quarter of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk and risk management the credit facility bears interest at variable rates  and accordingly  our earnings and cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates 
the credit facility requires that we maintain hedge agreements to provide either a fixed interest rate or interest rate protection on at least of our total outstanding debt 
the company has entered into the following interest rate swaps that effectively convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt as of december  under the terms of the agreements  the company receives variable interest based on the three month libor and pays a fixed rate of interest 
effective dates notional amounts pay rates maturity dates amounts in millions april  march  october  october  june  june  june  june  june  june  july  july  september  september  september  september  september  september  september  september  september  september  september  september  total  consists of three swaps consists of two swaps consists of four swaps based on the initial terms of the swap agreements  the annual cost of these swap arrangements will be approximately million 
the actual cost of the swaps will depend on the variable rate payments received 
assuming a increase in the interest rate associated with the borrowings under the credit facility after giving effect to the interest rate swaps  interest expense would increase million on an annual basis 
after the effect of the interest rate swap agreements discussed above  total fixed rate debt comprised approximately of our total debt portfolio as of december  the outstanding interest rate swaps expose us to credit risk in the event that the counterparties to the agreements do not or cannot meet their obligations 
the notional amount is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss 
the loss would be limited to the amount that would have been received  if any  over the remaining life of the swap agreements 
the counterparties to the swaps are major financial institutions  and we expect the counterparties to be able to perform their obligations under the swaps 
we use derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes only and not for trading or speculative purposes 
a discussion of our accounting policies and further disclosure relating to these financial instruments is included in note to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   which are included in item in this annual report 
market risk sensitive instruments the interest rate swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas and sfas  the swaps are recorded at fair value 
on a quarterly basis  the fair value of the swaps will be determined based on quoted market prices and  assuming effectiveness  the difference between the fair value and the book value of the swaps will be recognized in other comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity 
any ineffectiveness of the swaps is required to be recognized in earnings 
the swaps and the hedged item three month libor based interest payments on  million of bank debt have been designed so that the critical terms interest reset dates  duration and index coincide 
assuming the critical terms continue to coincide  the cash flows from the swaps will exactly offset the cash flows of the hedged item and no ineffectiveness will exist
