item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we began as a company focused on our core competencies  committed to our brands and the upper end of the soft floorcovering market  with a strong balance sheet  and well positioned to take advantage of an improving economy 
our business is concentrated in areas of the soft floorcovering market where innovative styling  design  color  quality and service as well as limited distribution are welcomed and rewarded 
through our fabrica  masland  and dixie home brands  we have a significant presence in the high end of the soft floorcovering market 
our candlewick carpet yarn operations supply plied and heat set filament yarns primarily to our carpet manufacturing businesses and processes yarn for independent carpet manufacturers 
during  we sold our carpet yarn extrusion operation 
in november and early fiscal  we sold substantially all of our assets located in north georgia  including our factory built housing carpet  needlebond  carpet recycling businesses and a carpet spun yarn manufacturing facility to shaw industries group  inc financial results for the operations sold have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
these sales significantly reduced our debt  diversified our customer base  and improved our strategic position 
critical accounting policies certain estimates and assumptions are made when preparing financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions affect various matters  including amounts reported for assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at the dates of the financial statements  and amounts reported for revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of operations during the reporting periods presented 
estimates involve judgments with respect to  among other things  future economic factors that are difficult to predict 
as a result  actual amounts could differ from estimates made in preparing the financial statements 
the securities and exchange commission sec has issued disclosure guidance requiring management to identify its most critical accounting policies 
such critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and the application of which requires our most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments  as a result of the need to make estimates about inherently uncertain matters that may change in subsequent periods 
we believe application of the following accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements and represent our critical accounting policies 
other significant accounting policies are discussed in note a to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when legal title of the products we sell passes to our customer  which is at the time goods are shipped 
accounts receivable 
we provide allowances for expected cash discounts  returns  claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and periodic evaluation of the financial condition of our customers 
if the financial condition of our customers significantly deteriorates  or other factors impair their ability to pay their debts  credit losses could differ from allowances recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
customer claims and product warranties 
we provide varying warranties related to our products against manufacturing defects and specific performance standards 
we record reserves for the estimated costs of defective products and failure to meet applicable performance standards 
the levels of reserves are established based primarily upon historical experience and our evaluation of known claims 
because our evaluations are primarily based on historical experience  actual results could differ from the reserves used in our consolidated financial statements 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the last in  first out method lifo  which generally matches current costs of inventory sold with current revenues  for substantially all inventories 
reserves are also established to adjust inventories that are off quality  aged or obsolete to their estimated fair market value 
inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities 
additionally  rates of recoverability per unit of off quality  obsolete or excessive inventory are estimated based on historical rates of recoverability 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to value our inventory 
goodwill 
goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing 
the impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of the underlying assets and businesses to which the goodwill applies based on estimates of future cash flows  which require management s judgments and assumptions about future economic factors that are difficult to predict and in some cases beyond our control 
changes in our judgments and assumptions about future economic factors could materially change our estimate of values and could materially impact the value of goodwill and our consolidated financial statements 
self insured accruals 
we estimate the costs to settle claims related to our self insured medical  dental and workers compensation plans 
these estimates include costs to settle known claims  as well as unreported claims 
the estimated costs of known and unreported claims are based on historical experience 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to estimate these accruals 
deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates that will be applicable in future periods when the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in income tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that the change in income tax rates is enacted 
taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of various items in a manner that could affect the tax treatment of such items going forward 
accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using existing laws  rules and regulations  each of which is subject to change 
loss contingencies 
we recognize a loss contingency when we believe it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
judgment must be applied to determine if such an event has occurred and to quantitify the financial impact of such an event 
results of operations our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with u 
s 
generally accepted accounting principles 
the following table sets forth certain elements of our continuing operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year ended december  december  december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling and administrative expenses impairments and other charges other operating income other operating expense operating income fiscal year ended december   compared with fiscal year ended december  net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  increased to million 
the improved revenue was driven by significant increases in sales of residential and commercial carpet products 
compared with  net sales of residential carpet increased and net sales of commercial carpet increased 
approximately half of the total improvement in net sales was attributable to our dixie home collection of residential products  which were introduced in early we believe the improved revenue is attributable to a growing economy and the overall strength of the carpet industry  particularly in the higher end of the soft floorcovering market where our business is concentrated  and the success of the new products we have developed during the past several years 
in  we developed a number of growth initiatives for our businesses 
these initiatives included introduction of the dixie home collection of products and a substantial increase in the development and introduc tion of new products in our other businesses 
the new products have been well received by the markets we serve and allowed us to increase business through existing customers 
a key factor in our ability to continue to grow profitably is our ability to develop highly styled  unique and differentiated quality products that meet the needs of the higher end market 
cost of sales 
cost of sales was of sales in both and the percentage comparison remained consistent despite significant increases in raw materials  utilities and other costs and a higher portion of our sales coming from lower margin products in the effect of the higher cost was offset by million due to a lifo inventory liquidation  increased selling prices and lower manufacturing costs per unit of production due to higher unit volume 
raw material price increases have been announced that will become effective in we expect to recover these and other cost increases by increasing the selling prices of our products and reducing manufacturing costs through improved efficiencies and better utilization of our assets 
gross profit 
the million improvement in gross profit is principally attributable to the higher sales volume 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased million in  but decreased to of net sales compared with of net sales in the percentage decrease is primarily attributable to the effect of the higher sales volume 
impairments and other charges 
we did not incur impairment and other charges in fiscal our operating income was negatively impacted by million of impairments and other charges principally related to assets impaired as a result of the sale of our north georgia operations 
other operating income 
other operating income decreased thousand in principally due to a lower level of gains from the sale of operating equipment 
other operating expense 
other operating expense increased in as a result of costs recognized related to a contract dispute 
operating income 
operating income was million  or of sales in  compared with operating income of million  or of sales in interest expense 
the million decrease in interest expense in was primarily a result of lower levels of debt 
other income 
other income improved thousand in principally as a result of the favorable settlement of a vendor dispute and higher interest income 
debt extinguishment costs

income tax provision benefit 
our effective income tax rate was for compared with benefit for the change in the effective tax rates is principally due to the relationship of expenses that are non deductible for tax purposes to pre tax earnings in each of these reporting periods and a thousand reduction in our tax contingency reserve in net income loss 
income from continuing operations was million  or per diluted share in  compared with a loss from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share in income from continuing operations was reduced by million  or per diluted share in  due to impairments and other charges and debt extinguishment cost related to the sale of our north georgia operations 
results related to discontinued operations reflected a loss of million  or per diluted share in  compared to a loss of million  or per diluted share in including discontinued operations  net income was million  or per diluted share in  compared with a net loss of million  or per diluted share in fiscal year ended december   compared with fiscal year ended december  net sales 
net sales for the year increased to million  an increase of compared with net sales in the prior year 
the revenue growth reflected a million  or increase in net sales of residential and commercial carpet products and a million  or decline in net sales of carpet yarn 
the improvement in carpet sales was attributable to new product introductions and the overall strength of higher end carpet markets 
almost half of the increased carpet revenue was due to the dixie home collection of products which were introduced in the marketplace in early over half of the carpet revenue increase in was attributable to year over year growth in the higher end residential and commercial markets served by our masland and fabrica business units 
the decline in carpet yarn sales resulted primarily from management s decision to de emphasize its carpet yarn sales business and utilize a greater portion of our carpet yarn capacity to supply our carpet businesses 
in addition  consolidation within the carpet industry by vertically integrated manufacturers has reduced the demand for carpet yarn produced by independent suppliers 
cost of sales 
cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  increased by percentage points in principally due to a greater portion of our sales coming from lower margin products 
gross profit 
the million improvement in gross profit is principally attributable to higher sales volume 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses were of net sales in compared with of net sales in the increase is principally due to cost associated with the new dixie home collection of products and related higher than normal sample costs associated with this new product line 
we anticipate that these expenses will decrease  as a percentage of net sales  as the volume of net sales of dixie home products increases 
additionally  we expect sample cost per dollar of net sales to decrease as dixie home s business matures 
impairments and other charges 
our operating income was negatively impacted by million of impairments and other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of the year ended december  the charges included million of non cash charges related to the write down of assets impaired as a result of the sale of our north georgia operations and million related to success fees paid to management in connection with the north georgia sale transaction

our operating income was reduced by million of impairments and other charges and improved by a million gain from the sale of an extrusion facility interest expense 
interest expense increased million in interest expense was allocated to continuing operations in and prior periods presented based on the ratio of the net asset value of the assets in our continuing operations to the net asset value of our total assets 
the increase in interest expense in was primarily a result of higher levels of debt due to the payment of a million contingent purchase obligation to the previous owners of fabrica in march of other income 
other income decreased thousand in principally due to lower earnings of an unconsolidated subsidiary 
other expense 
other expense decreased thousand in due to certain supplier and contract cancellation costs incurred and the termination of our accounts receivable securitization program in debt extinguishment costs 
costs to extinguish debt was million in  which included million of charges for cash pre payment penalties and fees and million of non cash charges to write off deferred financing cost associated with the debt retired  prior to its scheduled maturity  from the proceeds of the sale of our north georgia operations 
in  we recorded a million charge to write off deferred financing cost relating to refinancing our senior credit facility prior to its scheduled maturity 
income tax provision benefit 
our effective income tax rate was benefit for compared with for the change in the effective tax rates is principally due to a million contribution deduction in and the relationship of expenses that are non deductible for income tax purposes to pre tax earnings in each of these reporting periods

net proceeds from the sale of assets were million in  million in and million in the assets sold consisted primarily of a spun yarn manufacturing facility in  our north georgia operations in  and a yarn extrusion and a carpet yarn facility in capital expenditures were million in and depreciation and amortization was million 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million for the year  and depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately million 
the capital expenditures will be primarily for newer manufacturing technology  carpet tile manufacturing equipment to expand our commercial product line  and additional building space to accommodate this equipment and expand our distribution capabilities 
we amended our senior loan and security agreement in april and november as amended  the agreement reduced interest rates and certain fees applicable to the credit facility  modified financial covenants and provides the company with million of credit  consisting of million of revolving credit through may   a million term loan and a million capital expenditure line

certain factors affecting the company s performance in addition to the other information provided in this report  the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating results of our operations  future prospects and an investment in shares of our common stock 
any of these factors could cause our actual financial results to differ materially from our historical results  and could give rise to events that might have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the floorcovering industry is cyclical and prolonged declines in residential or commercial construction activity or corporate remodeling and refurbishment could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the us floorcovering industry is cyclical and is influenced by a number of general economic factors 
the floorcovering industry in general is dependent on residential and commercial construction activity  including new construction as well as remodeling 
new construction is cyclical in nature 
to a somewhat lesser degree  this also is true with residential and commercial remodeling 
a prolonged decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the level of activity in these industries is significantly affected by numerous factors  all of which are beyond our control  including consumer confidence  housing demand  financing availability  national and local economic conditions  interest rates  employment levels  changes in disposable income  commercial rental vacancy rates  and federal and state income tax policies 
our product concentration in the higher end of the residential and commercial markets could be a significant factor in the impact of these factors on our business 
we face intense competition in our industry  which could decrease demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
the floorcovering industry is highly competitive 
we face competition from a number of domestic manufacturers and independent distributors of floorcovering products and  in certain product areas  foreign manufacturers 
there has been significant consolidation within the floorcovering industry during recent years that has caused a number of our existing and potential competitors to be larger and have greater resources and access to capital than we do 
maintaining our competitive position may require us to make substantial investments in our product development efforts  manufacturing facilities  distribution network and sales and marketing activities  which may be limited by restrictions set forth in our credit facilities 
competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for our products and in the loss of market share 
in addition  we face  and will continue to face  pressure on sales prices of our products from competitors 
as a result of any of these factors  there could be a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
raw material prices may increase 
the cost of raw materials has a significant impact on our profitability 
in particular  our business requires the purchase of large volumes of nylon yarn  synthetic backing  latex  and dyes 
increases in the cost of these raw materials could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to pass these increases through to our customers 
prices of raw materials increased during and additional increases became effective in early for certain raw materials we use 
we believe we were successful in passing along the increases in and believe we will be successful in increasing prices to pass along raw material and other costs as they may occur  however  there can be no assurance that we will successfully recover such increases in cost 
unanticipated termination or interruption of our arrangements with third party suppliers of nylon yarn could have a material adverse effect on us 
nylon yarn is the principal raw material used in our floorcovering products 
a significant portion of our nylon yarn purchases is from one supplier 
we believe there are other adequate sources of nylon yarns  however  an unanticipated termination or interruption of our supply arrangements could adversely affect our supply arrangements and could be material 
we may be responsible for environmental cleanup costs 
various federal  state and local environmental laws govern the use of our facilities 
these laws govern such matters as discharges to air and water  handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and waste  and remediation of contamination from releases of hazardous substances in our facilities and off site disposal locations 
our operations also are governed by laws relating to workplace safety and worker health  which  among other things  establish noise standards and regulate the use of hazardous materials and chemicals in the workplace 
we have taken  and will continue to take  steps to comply with these laws 
if we fail to comply with present or future environmental or safety regulations  we could be subject to future liabilities 
however  we cannot insure that complying with these environmental or health and safety laws and requirements will not adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
future laws  ordinances or regulations could give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
acts of terrorism 
our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of international conflicts or acts of terrorism 
terrorist acts or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to our facilities  employees  customers  suppliers  and distributors  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
such conflicts also may cause damage or disruption to transportation and communication systems and to our ability to manage logistics in such an environment  including receipt of supplies and distribution of products 
interruptions beyond our control 
our business could be adversely affected if a significant portion of our plant  equipment or operations were damaged or interrupted by a casualty  condemnation  utility service  work stoppage or other event beyond our control 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
forward looking information this report contains statements that may be considered forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these statements include the use of terms or phrases that include such terms as expects  estimated  projects  believes  anticipates  intends  and similar terms and phrases 
such terms or phrases relate to  among other matters  our future financial performance  business prospects  growth strategies or liquidity 
the following important factors may affect our future results and could cause those results to differ materially from our historical results 
these factors include  in addition to those detailed above under the heading certain factors affecting the company s performance  the cost and availability of capital  raw material and transportation costs related to petroleum price levels  the cost and availability of energy supplies  the loss of a significant customer or group of customers  materially adverse changes in economic conditions generally in carpet  rug and floorcovering markets we serve and other risks detailed from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission
