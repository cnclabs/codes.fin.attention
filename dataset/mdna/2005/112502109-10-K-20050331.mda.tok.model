item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
amounts in this section have been rounded to the nearest thousand  except per share data 
unless otherwise indicated  or unless the context otherwise requires  references to years in this section mean our fiscal years ended december general our primary business activity is insurance sales through franchisees and most of our revenues are generated from commissions paid on the sale of insurance 
commission revenues typically represent a percentage of insurance premiums paid by policyholders 
premium amounts and commission percentage rates are established by insurance companies  so we have little or no control of the commission amount generated from the sale of a specific insurance policy 
our business also includes lending to businesses that sell insurance and related services 
unlike commission revenues  lending interest rates are typically set by us  although competitive forces are important limiting factors when establishing rates 
brooke franchise most of our revenues are from commissions paid to brooke franchise  our wholly owned franchise subsidiary  by insurance companies for the sale of insurance policies on a retail basis through exclusive franchisees 
brooke franchise primarily relies on the recruitment of additional franchisees to increase retail insurance commission revenues 
brooke franchise s franchisees specialize in general insurance sales  auto insurance sales  financial services and final expense funeral services 
brooke franchise also consults with business sellers and lenders 
brooke credit brooke credit  our wholly owned finance subsidiary  generates most of its revenues from interest income resulting from loans held on our balance sheet in the form of inventory loans held for sale  which are mostly made to brooke franchise s franchisees 
brooke credit also generates revenues from gains on the sale of franchisee loans when they are removed from our balance sheet 
brooke credit funds its loan portfolio primarily through the sale of loan participation interests to other lenders  commercial bank loans secured by loan assets and the sale of securities  backed by loan assets  to accredited investors 
during and  brooke credit sold three issues of asset backed securities totaling approximately  during  brooke credit secured a  line of credit with dz bank ag deutsche zentral genossenschaftsbank dz bank for the purpose of warehousing loans until securitized 
brooke brokerage we also generate revenues from commissions paid to brooke brokerage  our wholly owned brokerage subsidiary  by insurance companies for the sale of hard to place and niche insurance policies on a wholesale basis through non exclusive agents and our own franchise agents 
brooke brokerage primarily relies on the recruitment of additional broker agents to increase wholesale commission revenues 

table of contents results of operations our consolidated results of operations have been significantly impacted by our expansion of territory and personnel in recent years 
the following table shows income and expenses in thousands  except percentages and per share data for the years ended december   and  and the percentage change from year to year

expenses are also expected to continue to increase as a result of opening new franchise locations in the increase of commission expense in is primarily attributable to increases in insurance commissions 
table of contents received from insurance companies  because a share of insurance commissions is typically paid to franchisees 
payroll expenses  which include wages  salaries  payroll taxes and compensated absences expenses  and other operating expenses  which includes advertising  rent  travel  lodging  office supplies and insurance expenses  increased primarily as a result of the expansion of our franchise operations  the opening of additional service sales centers and the acquisition of texas all risk general agency in payroll expenses  as a percentage of total operating revenue  were approximately in  in  and in other operating expenses  as a percentage of total operating revenue  were approximately in  in  and in amortization expense increased in and primarily as a result of amortization of the servicing asset  which increased significantly as a result of brooke credit s participation loan sales activities 
depreciation expense increased in primarily as a result of the renovation of our national office facility in overland park  kansas in the third quarter of depreciation expense also increased as the result of equipment purchases associated with the acquisition of texas all risk general agency in in  depreciation expense increased primarily as a result of the acquisition renovation of our processing center facility in phillipsburg  kansas in the last quarter of the increase in other operating interest expenses in is primarily attributable to interest paid on the dz bank line of credit for the warehousing of loans until securitized 
the increase in is primarily attributable to the sale of  in unsecured series a brooke corporation debentures and  in unsecured series b brooke corporation debentures 
we consider bond and debenture interest expense to be an operating expense because the proceeds from the sale of such bonds and debentures are used to partially fund our lending activities 
we consider interest expense  other than bond and debenture interest expense  to be a non operating expense 
interest expense increased significantly in as a result of increased debt to commercial banks  which was incurred primarily to capitalize our operating subsidiaries  and increased notes payable balances resulting from deferred payments to sellers on acquired businesses 
in  interest expense increased primarily as a result of increased notes payable balances resulting from deferred payments to sellers on acquired businesses 
net income and net income per share have increased year over year primarily because we have increased the number of new franchises each year and a significant share of our revenues result from initial franchise fees associated with adding new franchise locations 
initial franchise fees typically have larger profit margins than those generated by our other activities 
assets are expected to continue to increase in as a result of continued expansion and holding more loans for longer periods of time prior to the sale of participation interests in such loans or securitizing such loans in order to increase interest income 
the following table shows selected assets and liabilities in thousands  except percentages as of december   and  and the percentage change from year to year

table of contents customer receivables primarily include amounts owed to brooke franchise by our franchisees and  to a lesser extent  amounts owed to brooke brokerage for premiums billed by agents 
customer receivables increased in primarily from continued expansion of our franchise operations and decreased in primarily because brooke credit began to provide working capital financing to franchisees  which increased notes receivables and decreased customer receivables 
a loss allowance was established for brooke franchise s credit loss exposure to customer receivables see franchise services segment 
notes receivables include loans made by brooke credit to franchisees and others 
notes receivables balances vary  sometimes significantly from year to year  as a result of our decision to temporarily retain more or fewer loans in our held for sale loan inventory based on the funds available to us 
during  brooke credit used its line of credit to increase its notes receivables balances 
no loss allowance has been made for the notes receivables held in brooke credit s loan inventory because we typically hold these assets for less than one year and  therefore  have a short term exposure to loss and we have experienced limited credit losses see lending services segment 
interest earned not collected on notes accrued interest income increased in and primarily because we are holding more loans for longer periods of time 
customer receivables  notes receivables and interest earned not collected on notes are the three items above that comprise our accounts and notes receivable  net  as shown on our consolidated balance sheet 
other receivables  which primarily include the estimated amounts due from franchisees for future policy cancellations  decreased in and primarily from repayment of amounts due to us from franchisees for certain commission advances 
the terms of our securitizations require the over collateralization of the pool of loan assets that back the securities sold to investors 
we retain ownership of the resulting subordinate interest in the loan pool  and the corresponding securities asset increased in and as the result of our securitization activity 
deferred charges increased in primarily as a result of origination fees and other such expenses associated with acquiring the dz bank line of credit 
accounts payable  which includes franchise payables  producer payables  payroll payables and other accrued expenses  increased in primarily from the continued expansion of our franchise operations  which significantly increased the accrual for estimated commission expense due franchisees 
payable under participation agreements is the amount we owe to funding institutions who have purchased a participating interest in loans pursuant to transactions that do not meet the true sale test of sfas accounting for transfers and services of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
payable under participation agreements increased in because we sold more loans pursuant to transactions that did not meet the true sale test 
the premiums payable liability category is comprised primarily of amounts due to insurance companies for premiums that are billed and collected by our franchisees 
premiums payable decreased in primarily as a result of an increased emphasis on direct insurance company billing of policies 
premiums payable increased in primarily as a result of the acquisition of texas all risk general agency  which sells more policies that are agent billed 
debt increased in and primarily to fund increases in our notes receivables and securities 
during  there was an extraordinary reduction in our retained earnings in the amount of  because our stock dividend of  shares at par value per share exceeded our paid in capital of  the excess over the paid in capital was allocated to retained earnings 
the following tables provide information regarding our notes receivables  notes participations  notes payables and bonds debentures payables principal balances and the corresponding weighted interest rates as of

in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we discuss financial measures stated in accordance with gaap and also those stated on a non gaap basis 
a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance that excludes or includes amounts included or excluded from the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
management believes non gaap measures aid in the analysis and comparability of our financial results 
non gaap financial measures presented herein primarily relate to management s efforts to identify our exposure to operating losses in the event that new franchise locations are not added and the associated revenues from non recurring initial franchise fees not recorded 
these non gaap financial measures 
table of contents include recurring revenues  recurring expenses  the ratio of recurring revenues to recurring expenses  non recurring revenues and the ratio of gain on loan sales to net interest revenues 
the following tables provide a reconciliation of these non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures for the years ended december   and recurring revenues  a non gaap financial measure  are defined as net franchise commissions  net interest income  net brokerage commissions and net brokerage underwriting profits 
because net revenues are used to calculate recurring revenues  gross commission income  gross interest income and gross insurance premium income are reduced by the corresponding amount of commission expense  other operating interest expense and insurance loss and loss expense incurred 
excluded from recurring revenues are non recurring revenues including initial franchise fees  seller consulting fees  gains on sales of businesses and gains on extinguishment of debt 
recurring revenues are generally considered by us to be those revenues that are reasonably likely to be recorded in the next year if no new franchise locations are added 
for the years ended december   and  recurring revenues were   and  respectively

excluded from recurring expenses are commission expense  other operating interest expense and insurance loss and loss expense incurred because these expenses have been netted against the corresponding revenue 
recurring expenses are generally considered by us to be those expenses that are reasonably likely to be incurred in the next year if no new franchise locations are added 
for the years ended december   and  recurring expenses were   and  respectively  resulting in ratios of recurring revenues to recurring expenses of  and  respectively 
the ratio of recurring revenues to recurring expenses is a non gaap financial measure important to us because it helps identify operating losses we would experience in the event that franchise locations are not added and the associated non recurring initial franchise fees not recorded 
year ended december in thousands total operating expenses reconciling items commission expense insurance loss loss expense incurred other operating interest expenses non gaap recurring expenses 
table of contents the amount of non recurring revenues is another non gaap financial measure important to us because our profitability is largely determined by the amount of non recurring revenues resulting from adding new franchise locations 
non recurring revenues are defined as initial franchise fees  seller fees  gains on sales of businesses and gains on extinguishment of debt 
specifically excluded from non recurring revenues are gains on loan sales because we intend to reduce the relative amount of revenues recorded from gains on loan sales 
non recurring revenues are generally considered by us to be those revenues that are dependent on adding new franchise locations 
for the years ended december   and  non recurring revenues totaled   and  respectively 
the increase in non recurring revenues is primarily attributable to the increase in franchise locations and the associated initial franchise fees 
year ended december in thousands total operating revenue reconciling items insurance commissions interest income net gain on sale of notes receivable insurance premiums earned policy fee income other income non gaap non recurring revenues the ratio of gain on sales of notes receivable to net interest revenues is another non gaap financial measure important to us 
it measures our success in decreasing the relative amount of revenues recorded from gains on sales of notes receivables  which are non cash revenues and are based on our assumptions

the deferred tax liability is due to accumulated other comprehensive income that resulted from the sale of notes receivables to participating banks and accelerated depreciation for tax in we had recorded a deferred tax asset of  as of december   from the tax benefits resulting from prior period losses 
during  all such remaining tax benefits were used 
analysis by segment our three reportable segments are franchise services  lending services and insurance brokerage 
the franchise services segment includes the sale of general insurance and related services to customers on a retail basis through franchisees by brooke franchise 
the lending services segment formerly referred to as our facilitator services segment includes our lending activities through brooke credit 
the insurance brokerage segment includes the sale of hard to place and niche insurance on a wholesale basis by brooke brokerage 

table of contents contrary to previous disclosures  the franchise services segment now includes initial franchise fees and seller related revenues because the associated services are performed by franchise personnel and included in revenues of brooke franchise 
previously  these franchise and seller related revenues were included in the lending services segment 
each segment is assessed a shared services expense which is an internal allocation of legal  accounting  information technology and facilities management expenses based on our estimate of usage 
except as noted  separate audited financial statements are prepared for each segment 
segment income and expenses exclude consolidating entries and segment assets and liabilities include consolidating entries  except total assets listed in tables 
franchise services segment financial information financial information relating to brooke franchise and our franchise services segment is as follows in thousands  except percentages year ended december  increase decrease over year ended december  increase decrease over year ended december  revenues insurance commissions seller consulting fees gain on sale of businesses initial franchise fees for basic services initial franchise fees for buyers assistance plans gain on extinguishment of debt interest income  net other income total revenues expenses commission expense payroll expense amortization other operating expenses total operating expenses income from operations interest expense income before income taxes total assets at period end and actual financial data corresponds to subsidiary audited financial reports for brooke franchise 
actual financial data was compiled using un audited internal revenue and expense allocations 
commission revenues insurance commissions  primarily from policies sold on an exclusive retail basis through franchisees  increased  or  to  in and  or  to  in retail insurance commissions have increased primarily as a result of brooke franchise s continued expansion of franchise operations 
brooke franchise received commissions from the sale of investment securities and revenues from the sale of funeral services that are not directly related to insurance sales 
however  these revenues are not sufficient to be considered material and are  therefore  combined with insurance commission revenues 
commission expense paid to brooke franchise s franchisees  increased  or  to  in and  or  to  in commission expense increased because insurance commission income increased and franchisees are typically paid a share of insurance commission income 
commission expense represented approximately  and  respectively  of brooke franchise s insurance commissions for the years ended december   and our service sales centers allow our franchisees to share office space and overhead costs provided by brooke franchise in exchange for an additional share of commissions paid to brooke franchise 

table of contents profit sharing commissions  or brooke franchise s share of insurance company profits paid by insurance companies on policies written by franchisees  increased  or  to  in and  or  to  in profit sharing commissions increased in and primarily because overall insurance company profits increased on policies written by brooke franchise s franchisees 
profit sharing commissions represented approximately and  respectively  of brooke franchise s insurance commissions for the years ended december  and franchisees do not receive any share of brooke franchises profit sharing commissions 
net commission refund expense is our estimate of the amount of brooke franchise s share of retail commission refunds due to policyholders resulting from future policy cancellations 
this expense increased  in and  in primarily as a result of brooke franchise s continued expansion of franchise operations 
as of december    and  brooke franchise recorded corresponding total commission refund liabilities of   and  respectively 
initial franchise fees for basic services a certain level of basic services is initially provided to all franchisees  whether they acquire an existing business and convert into a brooke franchise or whether they start up a new brooke franchise 
these basic services include services usually provided by other franchisors  including a business model  use of a registered trade name  access to suppliers and license for an internet based management system 
the amount of the initial franchise fees typically paid for basic services is currently  initial franchise fee revenues for basic services increased  in to  and was  in prior to  most initial franchise fees for basic services were accounted for as part of our initial franchise fees for buyers assistance plans see initial franchise fees for buyers assistance plan below 
none of the initial franchise fees collected by brooke franchise in was for basic services 
revenues from initial franchise fees for basic services are recognized immediately because brooke franchise has no continuing obligation 
initial franchise fees for basic services are typically assessed once for each franchisee even though some franchisees operate multiple locations 
a total of  and new franchise locations were added in  and  respectively 
initial franchise fees for buyers assistance plans the amount of the total initial franchise fees for all initial services typically varies based on the level of additional assistance provided by brooke franchise and as the result of negotiations with prospective franchisees 
the amount of total initial franchise fees collected by brooke franchise that exceed  are for payment of additional services provided pursuant to a buyers assistance plan 
the most significant part of brooke franchise s growth comes from acquisitions of existing businesses that are subsequently converted into brooke franchises 
brooke franchise provides assistance regarding the acquisition and conversion of businesses through a buyers assistance plan that provides initial franchise conversion assistance in addition to initial basic services 
initial franchise fees for buyers assistance plans decreased  in to  and increased  or  to  in beginning in the fourth quarter of  we began to categorize a significantly greater share of initial franchise fees as initial franchise fees for basic services 
as a result  in  initial fees for buyers assistance plans were flat in comparison to  however  total initial fees increased significantly in combined together  initial franchise fees for basic services and initial franchise fees for buyers assistance plans were  in compared to  in  an increase of 
the increase of initial franchise fees for buyers assistance plan services in resulted from continued expansion of brooke franchise s franchise operations and the corresponding increase in business acquisitions and franchise conversions by brooke franchisees 
brooke franchise records initial franchise fee revenues for buyers assistance plans using the percentage of completion accounting method  and   and  of initial franchise fee revenues for 
table of contents buyers assistance plans were deferred as of december   and  respectively 
buyers assistance plans provide initial conversion assistance for recently acquired businesses and buyers assistance plan services are  therefore  not provided to buyers of businesses that are already franchises 
in addition  buyers assistance plans are not typically provided to franchisees selling to other franchisees and are not provided to franchisees purchasing businesses that had previously been purchased by brooke franchise in the past twenty four months 
a total of  and of the new franchise locations in  and  respectively  represent businesses that were converted into a brooke franchise and received initial buyers assistance plan assistance 
initial franchise fees for start up assistance plans although brooke franchise expects to eventually receive additional initial franchise fees for start up assistance  no such initial franchise fees were received in  or a total of  and of the new franchise locations in  and  respectively  represent businesses that were started up as a brooke franchise and received initial start up assistance 
seller related revenues seller related revenues typically occur when a business is acquired by brooke franchise for sale to a franchisee or an agreement to purchase a business is assigned by brooke franchise to a franchisee 
seller related revenues include consulting fees paid directly by sellers  gains on extinguishment of debt to sellers and gains on sale of businesses directly acquired by brooke franchise from sellers 
seller related revenues increased  or  to  in and  or  to  in seller related revenues increased in and primarily as the result of continued expansion of brooke franchise s franchise operations and the corresponding increase in business acquisitions and franchise conversions by brooke franchisees 
consulting fees 
consulting fees paid directly by sellers include services provided by brooke franchise to help sellers prepare their businesses for sale by developing business profiles  tabulating revenues  sharing its legal library and general sale preparation 
revenues from consulting fees paid directly by sellers are recognized immediately because brooke franchise has no continuing obligation 
gains on sale of businesses 
our business includes the buying and selling of insurance agencies  financial service firms and funeral homes and holding them in inventory 
when purchasing an agency  we typically defer a portion of the purchase price  at a low or zero interest rate  to encourage the seller to assist in the transition of the agency to one of our franchisees 
we carry our liability to the seller at a discount  to reflect the below market interest rate 
the carrying value of the agency reflects this discount 
when we sell an acquired business to a franchisee typically on the same day it is acquired  we generally sell it for the full nominal price ie before the discount paid to the seller 
when the sale price exceeds the carrying value  the amount in excess of the carrying value is recognized as a gain 
gains on sale resulting primarily from discounted interest rates increased  or  to  in and increased  or  to  in to a limited extent  we acquire businesses and hold them for a period of time 
if these businesses are subsequently sold for a price greater than their carrying value  then we recognize a gain on sale of business 
unlike businesses held in inventory for resale  if we expect to hold businesses for a period of time before selling  then we treat the transactions as acquisitions and we apply purchase accounting methods  including booking and amortizing the intangible assets 
in  we acquired the stock or business assets of six auto insurance agencies for purchase prices totaling  with a carrying value of  and subsequently sold these six agencies during for a total of  we originally intended to hold these six agencies for a longer period of time and  therefore  we recorded intangible assets and the related amortization expenses in respect of such agencies in when we sold each of these agencies  the purchase price that we charged to the franchisee buyer included both the price that we paid for the agencies and the approximate amount of initial franchise fees that we would have charged if instead we had sold these agencies to one of our franchisees immediately after purchasing these agencies 
the gain on sale that resulted from our sales of these six agencies primarily resulted from the recapture of amortization expenses which amounted to  and the difference between our original aggregate purchase price for the agencies and the ultimate aggregate sales price which amounted to gains on debt extinguishment 
in the event that we repay the deferred portion of the purchase price to the seller before maturity for an amount less than our carrying value  we recognize the difference between our 
table of contents carrying value and the amount repaid to the seller as a gain on debt extinguishment 
gains on extinguishment of debt are recognized immediately because brooke franchise has no continuing obligation 
such gains on debt extinguishment are not considered extraordinary income because they are considered a part of our normal business operations 
income before income taxes brooke franchise s income before income taxes increased  or  to  in and increased  to  in income before taxes increased in and because revenues grew faster than expenses primarily as the result of significant increases in initial franchise fees and seller related revenues which have relatively high profit margins 
inventory management the number of total agencies purchased into inventory in  and were  and  respectively 
at december   and  brooke franchise held  and  respectively  insurance agencies in inventory with total balances  at the lower of cost or market  of   and  respectively 
the number of agencies twice purchased within twenty four months is an important indicator of brooke franchise s success in recruiting qualified buyers 
three of the agencies purchased by brooke franchise during had been first purchased by brooke franchise within twenty four months of brooke franchise s second purchase 
the purchase prices of those agencies twice purchased by brooke franchise totaled  when first purchased into inventory and  when purchased into inventory the second time 
as the result of the sale of twice purchased agencies  brooke franchise recorded a net gain of  in none of the agencies purchased by brooke franchise during and were twice purchased within twenty four months 
brooke franchise is not aware of any systemic adverse profitability or cash flow trends being experienced by buyers of businesses from its inventory 
franchise statement balances brooke franchise assists franchisees by financing cyclical fluctuations of revenues  receivables and payables with commission advances recorded on franchisees monthly statements and granting temporary extensions of due dates for franchise statement balances owed by franchisees to brooke franchise 
however  after expiration of the initial buyers assistance plan period  brooke franchise expects franchisees monthly statements to be repaid in full at least once every four months 
franchise statement balances totaled   and  respectively  as of december   and  respectively 
of these total franchise statement balances as of december   brooke franchise identified statement balances totaling  which it categorizes as watch because the balances had not been repaid in full at least once in the previous four months 
a similar identification of unpaid statement balances was not performed in and the balance of brooke franchise s allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  respectively  on december  and the amount of the december  allowance for doubtful accounts was determined based primarily on the amount of brooke franchise s watch statement balances and our analysis of credit risk 
other factors in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts were statement loss experience  brooke franchise s evaluation of the potential for future losses and brooke franchise s evaluation of the potential for future recoveries 
the following table summarizes the allowance for doubtful accounts activity for the years ended december    and in thousands 
additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged to expense 
write offs in include commission advances to start up franchisees totaling  most of which we believe will be recovered 
balance at beginning of year charges to expense write offs balance at end of year allowance for doubtful accounts year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  
table of contents revenue generation  primarily commissions from insurance sales  is an important factor in franchise financial performance and revenue generation is carefully analyzed by brooke franchise 
although brooke franchise analyzes revenues during the first twenty four months after conversion or startup  it is difficult to make reliable comparisons of businesses during this period 
converted franchises typically experience revenue decreases during the first months of operation and start up franchises typically experience significant revenue increases during the first months of operation 
therefore  months after initial conversion of an acquired business or the startup of a new brooke franchise  brooke franchise considers the franchise seasoned and the comparison of current to prior year revenues as a more reliable indicator of franchise success 
a total of franchise locations began their franchise relationship with brooke franchise prior to december  and have not purchased or sold a business since starting 
overall annual revenues of seasoned franchise locations in and increased and  to  and  respectively 
the median annual revenue growth rate of individual seasoned franchise locations in and increased and  to  and  respectively and the average annual growth rates of individual seasoned franchise locations in and increased and  to  and  respectively 
brooke franchise did not analyze revenues growth rates in all revenue generation calculations exclude profit sharing commissions 
brooke franchise believes that the decrease in overall franchise revenue growth rates primarily results from softer industry pricing and a decline of property and casualty insurance premiums causing a corresponding decline in commissions 
brooke franchise also believes that insurance premiums and commissions will not increase in and may decline further 
lending services segment financial information financial information relating to brooke credit and our lending services segment is as follows in thousands  except percentages year ended december  increase decrease over year ended december  increase decrease over year ended december  revenues interest income participating interest expense gain on sale of notes receivable other income total revenues expenses other operating interest expense payroll expense amortization other operating expenses total operating expenses income from operations interest expense income before income taxes total assets at period end actual financial data corresponds to subsidiary audited financial reports for brooke credit 
loan interest brooke credit typically sells most of the business loans it originates to funding institutions as participation interests and to accredited investors as asset backed securities 
prior to either type of sale transaction  brooke 
table of contents credit holds these loans on its balance sheet and earns interest income from the loans 
at the time of sale  we may recognize gains related to the portion of the interest income or asset backed securities that we retain 
once a sale is completed  we continue to earn interest income from any portion of the participation interest or asset backed security we retain 
we also continue to provide servicing for the loan  including loan accounting  receipt and distribution of interest payments and loan monitoring  and receive compensation for these activities 
to increase recurring revenues from interest income  brooke credit retained more loans for longer periods of time prior to the sale of participation interests in such loans or securitizing such loans 
total notes and interest receivables net increased to  at december  from  at december  interest income brooke credit earns interest income during the period it holds loans on its balance sheet and on that portion of the participation interest or those asset backed securities that it does not sell 
in  interest income increased to  from  in due to the larger volume of loans that brooke credit originated in and the longer period of time that brooke credit held those loans on its balance sheet 
in  interest income increased to  from  in due primarily to the increases in loan volumes from to participating interest expense a portion of the interest income that brooke credit receives on its loans is paid out to the holders of its participation interest 
those payments to these holders are accounted for as participating interest expense  which is netted against interest income 
in  participating interest expense increased to  from  in  primarily as a result of the increase in participation interests that were sold in in  participating interest expense increased to  from  in as brooke credit increased the amount of participation interests sold 
gain on sales of notes receivable when the sale of a loan is classified as a true sale pursuant to the criteria established by sfas accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  gains or losses are recognized  loans are removed from the balance sheet and residual assets  representing the present value of future cash flows from the interest and servicing spread  are recorded 
the interest and servicing spread is the difference between the rate paid by brooke credit to participating lenders and investors and the rate received by brooke credit from borrowers 
when the sale is classified as a secured borrowing  no gain on sale is recognized  and the note receivable and the corresponding participation loan remain on the balance sheet 
revenues from gain on sales of notes receivables were   and  in  and  respectively 
the year to year decrease in resulted from brooke credit s reduction in the relative amount of gain on sales revenues by retaining more sales of notes receivables as secured borrowings 
one component of the gain on sales of notes receivable is the gain associated with our ongoing servicing responsibilities 
when the sale of a loan participation interest is accounted for as a true sale  brooke credit retains servicing responsibilities for which it typically receives annual servicing fees ranging from 
to of the outstanding balance 
a gain or loss is recognized immediately upon the sale of a loan participation based on whether the annual servicing fees are greater or less than the cost of servicing  which is estimated at 
of the outstanding loan balance 
the gain or loss associated with loan servicing is determined based on a present value calculation of future cash flows from servicing the underlying loans  net of prepayment assumptions 
during  and  the net gains losses from loan servicing totaled   and  respectively  which consisted of gains from servicing benefits 
losses from servicing liabilities totaled   and  during  and  respectively 
the decrease in net gains from loan servicing benefits and servicing losses in is primarily the result of securitization activity and the increase in is primarily the result of increased loan originations 
in a true sale  brooke credit also records a gain on sale for the interest benefit based on a present value calculation of future cash flows of the interest and servicing spread on the underlying loans sold  net of prepayment and credit loss assumptions 
this spread is typically approximately for participation loans and 
table of contents approximately for securitized loan pools 
during  and  the net gains losses from interest benefits totaled   and  respectively  which included gross gains losses from interest benefits of    respectively  and losses from write down of retained interest asset to fair market value of    respectively 
the decrease in net gains from interest benefits in is primarily the result of greater reductions in net gain income from marking to fair market value the increasing retained interest asset balances 
gains losses from servicing and interest benefits are typically non cash gains losses as brooke credit receives cash equal to the carrying value of the loans sold 
a corresponding adjustment has been made on the statement of cash flows to reconcile net income to net cash flows from operating activities 
gain on sale accounting requires us to make assumptions regarding prepayment speeds and credit losses for participated loans and asset backed securities 
the performances of these loans are extensively monitored  and adjustments to these assumptions will be made if necessary 
underlying assumptions used in the initial determination of future cash flows on the participation loans and asset backed securities accounted for as sales include the following agency loans adjustable rate stratum agency loans fixed rate stratum prepayment speed weighted average life months months expected credit losses discount rate annual rates the most significant impact from the sale of loan participations and asset backed securities has been the removal of loans from brooke credit s balance sheet that brooke credit continues to service 
as of december   december  and december   the balances of those off balance sheet assets totaled   and  respectively 
the increased level of off balance sheet assets is primarily the result of a larger loan portfolio and the resulting sale of loan participations and asset backed securities 
loan servicing assets and liabilities when we recognize non cash gains for the servicing benefits of loan participation sales  we book that amount as a loan servicing asset on our balance sheet 
this amount is equal to our estimate of the present value of future cash flows resulting from the servicing spread 
we recognize such assets only when the income allocated to our servicing responsibilities exceeds our cost of servicing  which we typically estimate at of the loan value being serviced 
components of the servicing asset as of december  were as follows estimated cash flows from loan servicing fees less servicing expense discount to present value carrying value of retained servicing interest in loan participations in connection with the recognition of non cash losses for the servicing liabilities of loan participation sales  the present value of future cash flows were recorded as a servicing liabilities 
components of the servicing liability as of december  were as follows estimated cash flows from loan servicing fees less servicing expense discount to present value carrying value of retained servicing liability in loan participations 
table of contents loan participations interest receivable asset to the extent that the difference between the rate paid by brooke credit to participating lenders and investors and the rate received by brooke credit from borrowers exceeds the maximum of allocated to the servicing benefit  brooke credit recognizes a non cash asset  called an interest receivable asset  on its balance sheet 
this amount is equal to our estimate of the present value of future cash flows resulting from this interest spread 
components of the interest receivable asset as of december  were as follows estimated cash flows from interest income less estimated credit losses discount to present value carrying value of retained interest in loan participations estimated credit losses from liability on sold recourse loans with balances totaling  as of december  credit loss estimates are based upon experience  delinquency rates  collateral adequacy  market conditions and other pertinent factors 
securitization interest receivable asset the terms of brooke credit s securitizations require the over collateralization of the pool of loan assets that back the securities sold to investors 
brooke credit retains ownership of the resulting subordinate interest in the loan pool and borrows money from commercial banks to fund this investment 
brooke credit therefore retains a credit exposure in each loan pool 
as of december  brooke credit had subordinate investment interest in loan pools totaling  part of which is the carrying value of our retained interest in asset backed securities  and has borrowed  as of december  from commercial banks to fund this investment 
in connection with the recognition of non cash gains for the interest benefits of asset backed securities sales  the present value of future cash flows were recorded as an interest receivable asset and included on the balance sheet as part of the investment securities balance 
components of the interest receivable asset as of december  were as follows estimated cash flows from interest income less estimated credit losses discount to present value carrying value of retained interest in asset backed securities income before income taxes brooke credit s income before income taxes increased  or  to  in and increased  or  to  in although total revenues increased  or  to  in  income before taxes increased marginally because total expenses increased by a similar amount of  or  to  total expenses in were significantly affected by a  or increase in interest expense to  because brooke credit is holding more loans on its balance sheet for longer periods of time which is consistent with our plans to increase net interest revenues and to decrease the relative amount of gains on sale of note receivables 
correspondingly  gains on sale of notes receivable decreased  or  in to  the increase in net interest revenues had an adverse impact on brooke credit s income before taxes in  but is expected to increase brooke credit s income before taxes in future years 
in  gain on sale of notes receivable increased  or  to  but this increase was partially offset in by the first time assessment of a shared services fee in the amount of  loan quality no amounts of recourse loans and loans associated with securitizations were charged off for the year ended december  and no loans were delinquent days or more as of december   primarily because 
table of contents loan payments generally are deducted from commissions received by brooke franchise prior to payment of commissions to the borrower and most other creditors 
we believe that credit problems on recourse and securitized loans are more likely to be identified when brooke franchise collects franchisees monthly statement account balance than by monitoring brooke credit s loan delinquencies 
the terms of brooke credit s securitizations and a collateral preservation measure require that payments on the pool of loan assets that back the securities sold to investors be paid from commissions received by brooke franchise prior to payment of commissions to the borrower and to most other creditors 
as a result  we believe that our primary credit exposure generally results from brooke franchise s collection of monthly franchisees statement balances rather than from loan defaults to brooke credit 
accordingly  brooke credit has not established credit loss reserves separate from the credit loss allowances made on recourse loans referenced above 
perhaps a greater risk to brooke credit is the indirect exposure to credit losses that may be incurred by participating lenders and loan pool investors 
even if brooke credit does not bear any risk of direct credit losses  if losses by participating lenders and loan pool investors reach unacceptable levels  then brooke credit may not be able to sell loans in the future 
our business model requires that our franchisees have access to credit  so the inability to sell loans would have a significant adverse effect on brooke credit 
insurance brokerage segment financial information financial information relating to brooke brokerage and our insurance brokerage segment is as follows in thousands  except percentages year ended december  increase decrease over year ended december  increase decrease over year ended december  revenues insurance commissions policy fee income insurance premiums earned interest income other income total revenues expenses commission expense payroll expense depreciation and amortization insurance loss and loss expense incurred other operating expenses total operating expenses income from operations interest expense income before income taxes total assets at period end and actual financial data corresponds to subsidiary audited financial reports for brooke brokerage 
actual financial data was compiled using un audited internal revenue and expense allocations 

table of contents commission revenues insurance commissions  primarily from policies sold on a non exclusive wholesale basis through insurance agents  increased  or to  in and  or to  in brokerage insurance commissions have increased in primarily as a result of our acquisition of texas all risk general agency and in primarily as a result of our acquisition of cjd associates  llc commission expense paid to brooke brokerage s non exclusive insurance agents  increased  or to  in and  or to  in commission expense increased because insurance commission income increased and insurance agents are typically paid a share of commission income 
commission expense represented approximately  and  respectively  of brooke brokerage s total insurance commission income for years ended december   and the increase in the rate of commission expense from to primarily results from payments to agents of a larger share of commissions by texas all risk general agency 
profit sharing commissions  or brooke brokerage s share of insurance company profits paid by insurance companies on policies written by non exclusive insurance agents  increased  or to  in and  or to  in profit sharing commissions increased in primarily because overall insurance company profits increased on policies written by brooke brokerage s non exclusive insurance agents and the acquisition of texas all risk general agency 
profit sharing commissions represented approximately and  respectively  of brooke brokerage s insurance commissions for the years ended december  and policy fee income has increased primarily as a result of brooke brokerage s acquisition of texas all risk general agency 
policy fee income represented approximately  and  respectively  of brooke brokerage s insurance commissions for the years ended december   and net commission refund expense  or the estimated amount of brooke brokerage s share of wholesale commission refunds due to policyholders resulting from future policy cancellations  increased  to  in and increased  to  in the net commission refund expense increased in primarily as the result of acquiring texas all risk general agency 
on december   and  brooke brokerage recorded corresponding total commission refund liabilities of   and  respectively 
underwriting revenues part of brooke brokerage s strategy for increasing long term profitability is to reinsure selected hard to place and niche insurance policies placed by brooke brokerage with unaffiliated insurance companies to unaffiliated policyholders through the db group  ltd  a captive insurance company subsidiary wholly owned by brooke brokerage 
as of december   brooke brokerage had not reinsured any policies written through the db group and no premium revenues were recorded by the db group 
brooke brokerage has also established db indemnity  ltd  a captive insurance company wholly owned by brooke brokerage  to insure a portion of brooke franchise s professional liability exposure and to provide financial guaranty insurance for brooke credit 
although unlikely to have a significant effect on brooke brokerage s long term profitability  the issuance of policies through db indemnity to insure a portion of brooke franchise s professional liability exposure is important to brooke franchisees and the corresponding premiums are paid by brooke franchisees 
also  the issuance of financial guaranty policies through db indemnity is important to brooke credit s participating lender investors and the corresponding premiums are paid by brooke credit s borrowers 
db indemnity premiums increased  or  to  in from  in  db indemnity s first year of operation 
net premiums increased primarily because more financial guaranty policies were issued to brooke credit as the result of increased loan originations 
db indemnity has not incurred any claims or loss expense since beginning operations 
as of december    and  db indemnity recorded corresponding total reserves of   and  respectively 

table of contents income before income taxes brooke brokerage s income before income taxes increased  or  to  in and decreased  or  to  in income before taxes increased in primarily as the result of acquiring texas all risk general agency in the fourth quarter of income before taxes decreased in primarily as the result of decreased revenues for cjd associates  llc because access to insurance companies for a niche insurance policy for home medical equipment dealers was interrupted 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents were   and  as of december    and  respectively 
our current ratios current assets to current liabilities were   and at december    and  respectively 
the decrease in our current ratio from to is primarily due to an increase in short term debt and current maturities of long term debt from deferred payments to sellers on acquired business inventory 
the increase in our current ratio from to is primarily due to an increase in securities related to our loan securitizations in  the purchase of which was primarily financed with long term debt 
our current ratio and cash balances will be adversely affected if business inventory increases  seller loan balances are prepaid  or additional notes are retained in our portfolio 
our cash and cash equivalents increased a total of  from december  to december  during  net cash of  was used in operating activities 
cash of  was used to fund an increase in notes receivable and cash of  was provided by an increase in line of credit loans resulting in  in increased notes receivable balances that were not funded by line of credit balances 
this increase in notes receivable balances is the primary reason for our negative operating cash flow 
net cash of  was provided by investing activities 
a large net cash inflow resulted from business  primarily insurance agency  inventory transactions as cash proceeds of  from sales of business inventory exceeded cash payments of  for purchases of business inventory primarily because cash payments for part of the business purchase prices were deferred 
a cash inflow also resulted from the sale of subsidiaries and business assets  primarily auto insurance agencies  as cash proceeds of  from the sale of these assets exceeded corresponding cash purchases of  a cash outflow of  resulted from our purchase of securities related to our loan securitizations in net cash of  was provided by financing activities with  of cash provided by loan proceeds from long term debt and  of cash used to make payments on long term debt 
our cash and cash equivalents increased a total of  from december  to december  during  net cash of  was used in operating activities 
cash of  was used to fund an increase in notes receivable which is the primary reason for our negative operating cash flow 
cash of  was provided by an accounts receivable decrease which primarily resulted from increased loan balances to franchisees for payment of franchisee statement balances 
cash of  was provided by an increase in accounts and expenses payable which primarily resulted from a  increase in premiums due to insurance companies 
net cash of  was used to fund investing activities 
a large net cash inflow resulted from business  primarily insurance agency  inventory transactions as cash proceeds of  from sales of business inventory exceeded cash payments of  for purchases of business inventory primarily because cash payments for part of the business purchase prices were deferred 
a cash outflow of  resulted from our purchase of securities related to our loan securitizations in net cash of  was provided by financing activities with  of cash provided by loan proceeds on long term debt and  of cash provided by loan proceeds on short term line of credit borrowings 
if necessary  we believe that we can increase cash flow from operating activities within a relatively short period of time by liquidating our notes receivable portfolio through the sale of note  or loan  participations 
gains on sale of inventory have been excluded as an operating source of cash because changes in inventory have been classified as an investing activity 
we believe that we can increase cash flow from investing activities within a relatively short period of time by liquidating our business inventory 

table of contents our other assets account balances totaled   and  on december    and respectively and are comprised primarily of intangible accounts such as excess of cost over fair value of net asset and servicing assets 
if our total assets are adjusted to exclude other assets  then our total liabilities exceeded our total adjusted assets by   and  on december    and  respectively 
future acquisitions by us will likely increase the other assets account balances and will likely result in total liabilities exceeding adjusted total assets in future periods 
our investment in businesses account balances of   and  on december    and  respectively  represent the cost  or market value if lower  of businesses  primarily insurance agencies  held in inventory for resale to franchisees 
although intangible  business inventory is not included in other assets 
we believe that business inventory assets differ from other intangible assets  because business inventory is typically held for a relatively short period of time and has a recently demonstrated value 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and funds generated from operating  investing and financing activities will be sufficient to satisfy our normal financial needs 
additionally  we believe that funds generated from future operating  investing and financing activities will be sufficient to satisfy our future financing needs  including the required annual principal payments of our long term debt and any future tax liabilities 
capital commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years more than years short term borrowings long term debt operating leases facilities capital leases equipment other contractual commitments total our principal capital commitments consist of bank lines of credit  term loans  secured bonds  deferred payments to business sellers and obligations under leases for our facilities 
we have entered into enforceable  legally binding agreements that specify all significant terms with respect to the contractual commitment amounts in the table above 
critical accounting policies our established accounting policies are summarized in footnote number to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and as part of our oversight responsibilities  we continually evaluate the propriety of our accounting methods as new events occur 
we believe that our policies are applied in a manner that is intended to provide the user of our financial statements with a current  accurate and complete presentation of information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we believe that the following accounting policies are critical 
these accounting policies are more fully explained in the referenced footnote number to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition is summarized in footnote e 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these significant accounting estimates are summarized in footnote b 
we regularly sell the loans that we originate to banks and finance companies 
accounting for the sale of loan participations and loan securitizations and the subsequent tests for impairment are summarized in footnote 
table of contents we sometimes acquire insurance agencies and other businesses 
accounting for the acquisitions and the subsequent tests for impairment are summarized in footnote g 
with respect to the previously described critical accounting policies  we believe that the application of judgments and assumptions is consistently applied and produces financial information which fairly depicts the results of operations for all years presented 
off balance sheet arrangements the sale of loan participations and loan securitizations to banks and finance companies has resulted in the removal of a significant amount of loans from our balance sheet 
see footnote number to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of off balance sheet arrangements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see footnote number to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effects of the adoption of new accounting standards 
related party transactions see footnote number to our consolidated financial statements for information about related party transactions 
impact of inflation and general economic conditions although inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations  increases in the inflation rate are generally associated with increased interest rates 
a significant and sustained increase in interest rates could adversely affect our franchisees ability to repay the variable rate loans that we have made to them and thereby adversely affect our profitability 
such an interest rate increase could also adversely affect our profitability by increasing our interest expenses and other operating expenses 
all other schedules have been omitted because they are either inapplicable or the required information has been provided in the consolidated financial statements or the notes thereto 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we originate loans which will generally be sold to funding institutions as participation interests or to accredited investors as asset backed securities 
the majority of the loans are adjustable rate loans based on a prime rate plus a margin and interest rate changes will impact their value  and may impact credit losses and prepayments associated with the loans 
a significant rise in interest rates may result in an increase in credit losses 
a significant decrease in interest rates may result in an increase in prepayment speed 
when loans are sold  and the sale of participation interests or asset backed securities is classified as a true sale  we record a gain on sale for the interest benefit based on a present value calculation of future cash flows of the underlying loans  net of prepayment and credit loss assumptions 
when the sale of a loan participation interest is accounted for as a true sale  we retain servicing responsibilities for which we receive annual servicing fees based on a percentage of the outstanding balance 
the gain or loss associated with loan servicing is determined based on present value calculations of future cash flows from the servicing the underlying loans  net of prepayment assumptions 
the present value calculations of future cash flows of underlying loans and future cash flows from the servicing of underlying loans are based in part on management s estimates of discount rates 
a significant rise in interest rates could adversely affect the company s business financial condition and results of operation 
see footnote number to our consolidated financial statements regarding notes receivable  fair value and the effect of an adverse change to the discount rate 
at this time  we do not utilize derivative instruments to hedge against changes in interest rates or for any other purpose
