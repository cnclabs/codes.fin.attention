item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements and our combined consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included as part of this annual report on form k 
operating results factors affecting operating results our results of operations are affected by the following key factors in each of our business divisions agribusiness in the agribusiness division  we purchase  process  store  transport and sell agricultural commodities  principally oilseed products 
in this division  profitability is principally affected by the relative prices of oilseed products which are  in turn  influenced by global supply and demand for agricultural commodities and industry oilseed processing capacity utilization  and the volatility of the prices for these products 
profitability is also affected by energy costs  as we use a substantial amount of energy in the operation of our facilities  and by the availability and cost of transportation and logistics services  including truck  barge and rail services 
availability of agricultural commodities is affected by weather conditions  governmental trade policies and agricultural growing patterns  including substitution by farmers of other agricultural commodities for soybeans and other oilseeds 
demand is affected by growth in worldwide consumption of food products and the price of substitute agricultural products 
global soybean meal consumption grew by approximately per year on average over the last years 
we expect that population growth and rising standards of living will continue to have a positive impact on global demand for our agribusiness products 
from time to time  there may be imbalances between industry wide levels of oilseed processing capacity and demand for oilseed products 
prices for oilseed products are affected by these imbalances  which in turn affects demand for them and our decisions regarding whether and when to purchase  process  store  transport or sell these commodities  including whether to reduce our own oilseed processing capacity 
fertilizer in the fertilizer division  demand for our products is affected by the profitability of the brazilian agricultural sector  agricultural commodity prices  international fertilizer prices  the types of crops planted  the number of acres planted and weather related issues affecting the success of the harvest 
for the past years  the brazilian fertilizer industry has grown on average at a rate of per year 
the continued growth of the brazilian agricultural sector has had  and we expect will continue to have  a positive impact on demand for our fertilizer products 
in addition  our selling prices are influenced by international selling prices for imported fertilizers and raw materials  such as phosphate  ammonia and urea  as our products are priced to import parity 
food products in the food products division  which consists of our edible oil products and milling products segments  our operations are affected by competition  changes in eating habits and changes in general economic conditions in europe  the united states and brazil  the principal markets for our food products division  as well as the prices of raw materials such as crude vegetable oils and grains 
competition in this industry has intensified in the past several years due to consolidation in the supermarket industry and attempts by our competitors to increase market share 
profitability in this division is also affected by the mix of products that we sell 
in addition  our results of operations are affected by the following factors foreign currency exchange rates translation of foreign currency financial statements 
our reporting currency is the us dollar 
however  the functional currency of the majority of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currency 
we translate the amounts included in the consolidated statements of income of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars on a monthly basis at weighted average exchange rates  which we believe approximates the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions 
our foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars from local currency at year end exchange rates  and we record the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
included in other comprehensive income for the year ended december  and were foreign exchange net translation gains of million and million  respectively  representing the net gains from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities 
included in other comprehensive income loss for the year ended december  were foreign exchange net translation losses of million representing the net loss from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities 
foreign currency transactions 
certain of our foreign subsidiaries  most significantly those in brazil and argentina  have monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in us dollars 
these us dollar monetary items are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting gain or loss is included in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange gain or loss 
due to the global nature of our operations  our operating results are vulnerable to currency exchange rate changes 
however  our inventory of agricultural commodities  because of their international pricing in us dollars  provides a natural hedge to our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in addition  historically  our fertilizer and food products divisions also have been able to link sales prices to those of us dollar linked imported raw material costs  thereby minimizing the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations in those segments 
argentina and brazil 
the volatility of the argentine peso and brazilian real affects our financial performance 
devaluations of these currencies against the us dollar generally have a positive effect on our results  as local currency denominated costs are translated to us dollars at weaker real or peso to us dollar exchange rates resulting in lower us dollar costs 
in addition  commodity inventories in our agribusiness segment are stated at market value  which is generally linked to us dollar based international prices 
as a result  devaluations cause gains based on the changes in the local currency value of the agribusiness inventories 
conversely  devaluations generate offsetting net foreign exchange losses on the net us dollar monetary position of our brazilian and argentine subsidiaries  which are reflected in foreign exchange losses in our consolidated statements of income 
our effective tax rate is also favorably affected by the devaluation of the brazilian real as we recognize tax benefits related to foreign exchange losses on certain intercompany loans 
appreciations generally have a corresponding negative effect on our results when local currency costs are translated to us dollars at stronger real or peso to us dollar exchange rates and losses are generated based on changes in the local currency value of our agribusiness segment commodity inventories 
conversely  the appreciation of the real and peso generates offsetting net foreign exchange gains on the net us dollar monetary position of our brazilian and argentine subsidiaries  which are reflected in foreign exchange gains in our consolidated statements of income 
our effective tax rate is unfavorably affected by the appreciation of the brazilian real as we incur income taxes related to foreign exchange gains on certain intercompany loans 
however  as management deems prudent  we use derivative instruments to offset the foreign exchange gains on intercompany loans  which reduces the income tax expense resulting from the appreciation of the brazilian real 
the real appreciated and the peso devalued  against the us dollar in the year ended december   compared to an appreciation of the real and peso of and  respectively  in the same period in we use long term intercompany loans to reduce our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in brazil  particularly their effects on our results of operations 
these loans do not require cash payment of principal and are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
as a result  the foreign exchange gains or losses on these intercompany loans are recorded in other comprehensive income loss in contrast to foreign exchange gains or losses on third party debt and short term intercompany debt  which are recorded in foreign exchange gains losses in our consolidated statements of income 
european operations 
we operate in countries that are members of the european union and several countries that are not members of the european union 
our risk management policy is to fully hedge our monetary exposures in those countries to minimize the financial effects of fluctuations in the euro and other european currencies 
acquisitions in  we acquired the remaining of the outstanding capital stock of bunge brasil that we did not already own for million in cash 
as a result of the acquisition  we now own of bunge brasil and its subsidiaries  bunge alimentos sa and bunge fertilizantes sa we have consolidated the operating results of these entities since we accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method as a step acquisition of minority interest 
income taxes as a bermuda exempted company  we are not subject to income taxes in our jurisdiction of incorporation 
however  our subsidiaries  which operate in multiple tax jurisdictions  are subject to income taxes at various statutory rates 
in  the sale of our brazilian soy ingredients business to solae for a gain of million did not result in taxable income and therefore no income tax was provisioned 
we have obtained tax benefits under us tax laws providing tax incentives on export sales from the use of a us foreign sales corporation  or fsc  through beginning in  due to the repeal of the fsc related legislation  we were required to use the tax provisions of the extraterritorial income act eti legislation  which were substantially similar to the fsc related legislation 
the us congress has recently passed  and the president has signed  the american jobs creation act of that ultimately repeals the eti benefit 
under the new legislation  the eti will be phased out with of the otherwise available eti benefit retained for  of the eti benefit retained for  of the eti benefit retained for and the eti benefit phased out completely in the current tax legislation lowered our overall tax liabilities by approximately million in the eti benefit has been replaced with an income tax deduction intended to allocate benefits previously provided to us exporters across all manufacturers when fully phased in 
although most of our us operations qualify as manufacturing  we expect that this new tax legislation will be less beneficial to us than the prior one primarily due to our us tax position 
inflation inflation did not have a material impact on our business in  or critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part iii of this annual report 
allowances for uncollectible accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable and secured advances to farmers and record allowances for uncollectible accounts if we have determined that collection is doubtful 
we base our determination of the allowance for uncollectible accounts on analyses of credit quality for specific accounts  historical trends of charge offs and recoveries and market and other conditions 
different assumptions  changes in economic circumstances or the deterioration of the financial condition of our customers could result in additional provisions to the allowance for uncollectible accounts and an increase in bad debt expense 
recoverable taxes we evaluate the collectibility of our recoverable taxes and record valuation allowances if we determine that collection is doubtful 
recoverable taxes primarily represent value added taxes paid on the acquisition of raw materials and other services which can be recovered in cash or as compensation of outstanding balances against income taxes or certain other taxes we may owe 
we have recorded valuation allowances against certain recoverable taxes owed to us by the argentine government due to uncertainty regarding the local economic environment 
management s assumption about the collectibility of recoverable taxes requires significant judgment because it involves an assessment of the ability and willingness of the argentine government to refund the taxes 
the balance of these allowances fluctuates depending on the sales activity of existing inventories  purchases of new inventories  seasonality  changes in applicable tax rates  cash payment by the argentine government and compensation of outstanding balances against income or certain other taxes owed to the argentine government 
at december  and  our allowances for recoverable taxes in argentina were million and million  respectively 
we continue to monitor the economic environment and events taking place in argentina and will adjust these reserves in the future depending upon significant changes in circumstances 
agricultural commodity derivatives to the extent we consider it prudent for minimizing risk  we use exchange traded futures and options contracts to minimize the effect of price fluctuations on agricultural commodity transactions 
the futures and options contracts that we use for hedging are purchased and sold through regulated commodity exchanges 
we also manage risk by entering into fixed price purchase contracts with pre approved producers and establishing limits for individual suppliers 
fixed price sales contracts are entered into with customers with acceptable creditworthiness  as determined by us 
the fair values of futures and options contracts are determined primarily from quotes listed on the applicable commodity exchanges 
fixed price purchase and sales contracts are with various counter parties and the fair value of such contracts are determined from the market price of the underlying product 
we are exposed to loss in the event of nonperformance by the counter parties to these contracts 
the risk of nonperformance is routinely monitored and provisions recorded if necessary to account for potential nonperformance 
different assumptions  changes in economic circumstances or the deterioration of the financial condition of the counter parties to these contracts could result in additional provisions and increased expense reflected in cost of goods sold 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of costs of businesses acquired over the fair market value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually 
in assessing the recovery of goodwill  projections regarding estimated discounted future cash flows and other factors are used to determine the fair value of the reporting units and the respective assets 
these projections are based on historical data  anticipated market conditions and management plans 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual impairment test and determined that there were no impairments of goodwill 
intangible assets and long lived assets long lived assets include property  plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets 
when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the projected future cash flows to be generated by such assets 
if it appears that the carrying value of our assets is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss as a charge against results of operations 
our judgments related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amount of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our long lived assets  changes in these factors could cause us to realize material impairment charges 
in  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge in our agribusiness segment of million relating to fixed assets in one of our western european oilseed processing facilities and million relating to certain of our north and south american edible oil facilities 
certain refining and packaging operations in our western european oilseed processing facility are being closed and the north and south american edible oil facilities  which are older and less efficient  are being replaced by new facilities 
contingencies we are a party to a large number of claims and lawsuits  primarily tax and labor claims in brazil  arising in the normal course of business  and have accrued our estimate of the probable costs to resolve these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with in house and outside counsel and is based on an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings 
for more information on tax and labor claims in brazil  please see item legal proceedings 
employee benefit plans we sponsor various pension and postretirement benefit plans 
in connection with the plans  we make various assumptions in the determination of projected benefit obligations and expense recognition related to pension and postretirement obligations 
key assumptions include discount rates  rates of return on plan assets  asset allocations and rates of future compensation increases 
management develops its assumptions based on its experience and by reference to market related data 
all assumptions are reviewed periodically and adjusted as necessary 
in  we lowered the weighted average discount rate assumption used to calculate projected benefit obligations under the plans from at the september  measurement date to at the september  measurement date  largely based on decreases in the market rates of us aa rated corporate bonds with similar maturities 
us based plans represent approximately of total projected benefit obligations 
the weighted average rate of return assumption on assets of funded plans declined from to as of the measurement date due to a reduction in the assumed rate of return for certain us based plans and the average targeted assumed asset allocations of equity securities and fixed income securities such as government and corporate debt securities for the significant plans 
in  we recognized an additional minimum pension liability  which reduced shareholders equity by million  net of tax benefit of million due primarily to the reduction in the discount rate assumption 
future recognition of additional minimum pension liabilities will depend on the actual return on the plans assets and the discount rate 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate on our defined benefit pension plans would increase annual expense and the projected benefit obligation by million and million  respectively 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in the long term return assumptions on our defined benefit pension plan assets would increase or decrease annual pension expense by million 
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we are likely to realize 
we consider projections of future taxable income and prudent tax planning strategies to assess the need for and the size of the valuation allowances 
if we determine that we can realize a deferred tax asset in excess of our net recorded amount  we decrease the valuation allowance  thereby increasing net income 
conversely  if we determine that we are unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset  we increase the valuation allowance  thereby decreasing net income 
prior to recording a valuation allowance  our deferred tax assets were million at december  however  we have recorded valuation allowances of million as of december   primarily representing the uncertainty regarding the recoverability of certain net operating loss carryforwards 
results of operations overview our agribusiness results for improved in most business lines and geographic regions compared to effective freight and risk management and efficiency improvements in our logistics operations contributed to the improved results 
soybean prices were volatile during the first three quarters of soybean prices began increasing in the third quarter of because of a poor us crop and a south american soybean harvest that was unchanged compared to the prior year 
however  the soybean market made a rapid transition from a period of shortage to one of ample supply during the third quarter of in response to the record soybean crop in the united states and forecasts of larger south american harvests compared to as a result  during the third quarter of  soybean prices declined significantly to more normalized levels 
our agribusiness earnings are not directly tied to commodity prices  as segment operating profit is primarily determined by the relative difference between the price at which we buy commodities and the price at which we sell the derived commodity products  such as soybean meal and soybean oil  among other factors 
we also minimize our exposure to price fluctuations through hedging transactions 
our agribusiness volumes in increased only over as demand was hampered by record high commodity prices 
however  the usda is projecting an increase in global soybean meal consumption in in addition  increased demand for biofuels in europe  north america and brazil should further stimulate demand for vegetable oil 
our fertilizer results in benefited from higher average selling prices for fertilizers 
international selling prices for imported fertilizers and raw materials were higher than  which helped to increase margins on locally produced fertilizer as it is priced to import parity 
in our edible oil business  excluding the results of lesieur which we sold in july  our sales volumes increased primarily in north america and our operating profit increased in our softseed businesses in eastern europe 
segment results in  we reclassified certain consumer product lines from the agribusiness segment to the edible oil products segment 
as a result  amounts for the year ended december  have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
in the second quarter of  we sold our brazilian soy ingredients business to the solae company  our joint venture with dupont 
as a result  our other soy ingredients segment now reflects only the historical results of the soy ingredients business 
a summary of certain items in our consolidated statements of income and volumes by reportable segment for the periods indicated is set forth below 
year ended december  year ended december  percent change percent change us in millions  except percentages volumes in thousands of metric tons agribusiness    fertilizer    edible oil products    milling products    other soy ingredients total    net sales agribusiness    fertilizer    edible oil products    milling products other soy ingredients total    costs of goods sold agribusiness    fertilizer    edible oil products    milling products other soy ingredients total    gross profit agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products other soy ingredients total    selling  general and administrative expenses agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products other soy ingredients total foreign exchange gain loss agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products other soy ingredients total year ended december  year ended december  percent change percent change us in millions  except percentages interest income agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products other soy ingredients total interest expense agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products other soy ingredients total segment operating profit agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products  milling products other soy ingredients total depreciation  depletion and amortization agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products other soy ingredients total net income total segment operating profit is our consolidated income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest that includes an allocated portion of the foreign exchange gains and losses relating to debt financing operating working capital  including readily marketable inventories 
also included in total segment operating profit is an allocation of interest income and interest expense attributable to the financing of operating working capital 
total segment operating profit is a non gaap measure and is not intended to replace income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest  the most directly comparable gaap measure 
total segment operating profit is a key performance measurement used by our management to evaluate whether our operating activities cover the financing costs of our business 
we believe total segment operating profit is a more complete measure of our operating profitability  since it allocates foreign exchange gains and losses and the cost of debt financing working capital to the appropriate operating segments 
additionally  we believe total segment operating profit assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of our portfolio of businesses before non operating factors that affect net income 
total segment operating profit is not a measure of consolidated operating results under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest or any other measure of consolidated operating results under gaap 
below is a reconciliation of income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest to total segment operating profit year ended december  us in millions income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest unallocated income expense net gain on sale of soy ingredients business total segment operating profit unallocated income expense net includes interest income  interest expense  foreign exchange gains and losses and other income and expense not directly attributable to our operating segments 
compared to agribusiness segment 
agribusiness segment net sales increased due to higher average selling prices for soy commodity products and a increase in volumes 
selling prices for soy commodity products increased compared to last year primarily due to the shortage associated with the reduced us soybean crop 
prices of our softseed products also increased following the trend of soybean product prices 
volume increases were driven mainly by higher origination volumes in north america and south america 
cost of goods sold increased due to higher raw material costs  increased volumes and provisions related to the values of certain forward sales contracts for agricultural commodity products due to nonperformance by counter parties 
included in cost of goods sold in were million of non cash impairment charges on long lived assets and million of restructuring charges relating to our western european oilseed processing operations 
included in cost of goods sold in were million of non cash impairment charges on long lived assets in our european oilseed processing operations  a million decline in our allowance for recoverable taxes as a result of either cash received by us or compensation against taxes owed by us to the argentine government and a curtailment gain of million relating to the reduction of pension and postretirement healthcare benefits of certain us employees 
gross profit increased due to improvements in margins which resulted from effective freight and risk management  strong softseed profitability  efficiency improvements in logistics and higher volumes 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased primarily due to increases in bad debt expense associated with higher commodity prices  increased variable employee compensation expense relating to the improved financial results  increased legal and tax provisions and an increase in the work force in our international marketing business 
sg a in benefited from a million curtailment gain relating to certain postretirement healthcare benefit plans 
foreign exchange losses for were million compared to foreign exchange gains of million in through the first six months of  the brazilian real devalued against the us dollar  resulting in exchange losses on our us dollar net monetary liability position in brazil 
our us dollar monetary exposure in brazil is typically at its highest level during the first half of the year 
during the second half of  the brazilian real appreciated  resulting in exchange gains on our us dollar net monetary liability position in brazil 
however  the exposure to the us dollar was lower and thus the related exchange gains recorded in the second half of were not enough to offset the exchange losses recorded through the first six months of the exchange gains in resulted from the appreciation of the brazilian real 
foreign exchange gains and losses are substantially offset by inventory mark to market adjustments  which are included in cost of goods sold 
interest expense increased primarily due to higher average levels of operating working capital  as a result of the higher commodity prices experienced during most of the year 
segment operating profit increased primarily due to the improvements in margins and volume growth 
fertilizer segment 
fertilizer segment net sales increased due to higher average selling prices 
selling prices benefited from higher international selling prices for imported fertilizers and raw materials  which helped increase local sales prices as local fertilizer products are priced to import parity 
although volumes in were flat versus  retail fertilizer sales volumes increased as a result of a slight increase in market share 
however  the retail fertilizer volume growth in was offset by a decrease in sales volumes of lower margin fertilizer byproducts  such as gypsum 
cost of goods sold increased due to higher imported raw material costs mitigated in part by lower local production costs as we are able to source much of our raw materials from our own mines 
gross profit increased as a result of higher fertilizer selling prices  partially offset by increases in imported raw material costs 
sg a increased primarily due to bad debt provisions associated with the higher selling prices  increases in employee compensation expense because of higher salaries and certain other labor and legal provisions 
in addition  benefited from non recurring credits relating to social health and welfare taxes in brazil and lower bad debt expense 
segment operating profit increased primarily due to the increase in gross profit  partially offset by the increase in sg a  higher foreign exchange losses as a result of costs associated with managing foreign exchange exposure and higher interest expense associated with increases in working capital levels 
edible oil products segment 
the table below outlines our edible oil products segment results for and the results for include the results of lesieur  a french bottled oil producer  which we sold to our saipol joint venture in july in addition  for comparative purposes  the results of our edible oil products segment excluding lesieur and the results of lesieur alone are also presented 
year ended december  year ended december  excluding lesieur actual actual lesieur us in millions  except volumes volumes in thousands of metric tons    net sales    cost of goods sold    gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses foreign exchange gain interest income interest expense segment operating profit edible oil products segment net sales  excluding lesieur  increased primarily due to a increase in sales volumes and higher average selling prices 
increases in selling prices were primarily due to higher raw material costs  principally crude soybean oil 
the increase in soybean oil prices also resulted in higher selling prices for other softseed products as they follow the trend of soybean oil prices primarily in north america and eastern europe 
volumes increased primarily in north america as a result of stronger demand 
cost of goods sold  excluding lesieur  increased primarily due to increases in sales volumes and higher raw material costs 
included in cost of goods sold in were million of impairment charges relating to write downs of certain refining and packaging facilities in our north and south american edible oil operations and in  a million curtailment gain relating to certain postretirement healthcare benefit plans 
gross profit  excluding lesieur  increased primarily due to increases in sales volumes and margin expansion in eastern europe and canada as a result of the higher average selling prices 
in europe and canada  softseed product selling prices increased in response to higher soy commodity prices 
sg a  excluding lesieur  decreased primarily due to lower marketing expenses 
sg a in benefited from a million curtailment gain relating to certain postretirement healthcare benefit plans 
segment operating profit  excluding lesieur  increased primarily due to the improvement in gross profit margins and increases in sales volumes 
milling products segment 
milling products segment net sales increased primarily due to a increase in sales volumes 
corn milling volumes increased primarily due to higher sales to us commercial customers  higher sales under the us government food aid program and the addition of a corn milling facility acquired in the latter half of the increase in wheat milling volumes was primarily due to the addition of our industrial flour business which resulted from the asset exchange of bunge s brazilian retail flour assets for j 
mac do sa s industrial flour assets and million in cash in march cost of goods sold increased due to the increase in sales volumes and higher raw material costs 
gross profit increased primarily due to the increase in sales volumes 
segment operating profit increased by as a result of the improvement in gross profit 
consolidated financial costs 
the following is a summary of consolidated financial costs for the periods indicated year ended december  percent change us in millions  except percentages interest income interest expense foreign exchange gains losses included in interest income for was million of interest income earned on the cash invested in brazil from the net proceeds of the june public equity offering  which was used in the third and fourth quarters of to acquire the remaining equity interest in bunge brasil that we did not already own 
excluding this million  interest income decreased due to lower interest rates earned on invested cash in brazil  partially offset by an increase in the average balance of invested cash 
interest expense decreased million primarily due to lower interest rates on our debt portfolio and million of benefits from interest rate hedges  partially offset by higher average borrowings 
foreign exchange losses of million included costs associated with managing foreign exchange exposure related to our monetary exposure in brazil and exchange losses on our brazilian us dollar net monetary liability position primarily due to the devaluation of the brazilian real in the first six months of the first half of the year is usually when our us dollar net monetary liability exposure in brazil is at its highest level because of our acquisition of crops harvested in april  may and june 
during the six months ended december   the brazilian real appreciated resulting in exchange gains on the us dollar net monetary liability position in brazil in that period 
however  the exposure to the us dollar was lower and thus the related exchange gains recorded in the six months ended december  were not enough to offset the exchange losses recorded in the first six months of the appreciation in the value of the euro during also resulted in exchange gains on our european us dollar monetary liability position 
the exchange gains in resulted from the appreciation in the value of the brazilian real versus the us dollar and a gain on a net us dollar denominated monetary asset in argentina 
foreign exchange gains and losses are substantially offset by inventory marked to market adjustments  which are included in cost of goods sold 
other income expense net 
other income expense net increased million to million in from million of income in primarily due to million of gains on interest rate derivatives and the pre tax gain of million on the asset exchange transaction with j 
mac do  offset by a decrease in our earnings from solae 
solae s results declined primarily due to lower margins on product sales caused by the high commodity costs that existed during most of income tax expense 
income tax expense increased million to million in from million in primarily due to an increase in pretax income 
our annual effective tax rate for was  compared to an annual effective tax rate of in excluding the tax free gain on the sale of our brazilian soy ingredients business to solae  the annual effective tax rate was 
the primary cause of the decrease in the effective tax rate was due to increased earnings in in lower tax jurisdictions 
minority interest 
minority interest expense increased million to million in from million in primarily due to increased earnings at our less than wholly owned subsidiaries 
net income 
net income increased million to million in from million in net income for included million of after tax impairment and restructuring charges on long lived assets in europe and a million after tax gain on the asset exchange transaction with j 
mac do 
net income for included the million gain on the asset sale of our brazilian soy ingredients business to solae  an after tax gain of million relating to the curtailment of certain pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans  million of after tax impairment charges on long lived assets in europe and a loss on discontinued operations of million related to operations we sold in compared to fiscal was the first full year of combined operations with cereol  which we acquired in october we increased sales volumes and net sales between and primarily due to the cereol acquisition and through organic growth 
agribusiness segment 
agribusiness segment net sales increased due to a increase in volumes and higher average selling prices for soy commodity products 
volumes increased due to organic growth and due to the acquisition of cereol 
soy commodity product prices increased sharply during the third and fourth quarters of driven by the reduced us soybean crop 
heightened concerns relating to mad cow disease late in the fourth quarter of also contributed to price increases 
cost of goods sold increased in from due to the increased volumes  increased raw material costs due to the tight united states old crop carryover  higher energy costs due to increases in gas prices and the october acquisition of cereol 
cost of goods sold in reflected commodity inventory marked to market losses in our brazilian and argentine subsidiaries that resulted from the appreciation of the real and peso of and  respectively  versus a devaluation of and  respectively  in which resulted in marked to market gains 
included in cost of goods sold in were million of non cash impairment charges on long lived assets in our european oilseed processing operations  a million decline in our allowances for recoverable taxes as a result of either cash received by us or compensation against taxes owed by us to the argentine government and a curtailment gain of million relating to the reduction of pension and postretirement healthcare benefits of certain us employees 
cost of goods sold in included a million charge relating to reserves for recoverable taxes from the argentine government 
gross profit in decreased due to the increase in cost of goods sold 
agribusiness gross profit through the third quarter of lagged behind the prior year primarily because of weaknesses in north american and european oilseed processing margins and a return to more normal margins in south america 
these results were offset in part by improved margins in the fourth quarter of relating to effective risk management strategies  including ocean freight results 
the decline in gross profit was more than offset by changes in the foreign exchange results from a loss of million in to a gain of million in on the net monetary us dollar liability positions of our brazilian and argentine subsidiaries 
sg a increased in primarily due to our acquisition of cereol and higher costs associated with the increase in sales volumes 
also included in sg a in was a non cash curtailment gain of million  relating to the reduction of pension and postretirement healthcare benefit liabilities for employees transferred to solae and the reduction of pension and postretirement healthcare benefit of certain us employees 
segment operating profit declined primarily due to the decrease in gross profit and increase in sg a partially offset by foreign exchange gains 
fertilizer segment 
fertilizer segment net sales increased due to higher average selling prices and an increase in volumes 
selling prices benefited from higher international selling prices for imported fertilizers and raw materials  such as phosphate  ammonia and urea  which helped boost local prices as products are priced to import parity 
international selling prices of phosphate  ammonia and urea increased  and  respectively  during our sales of retail fertilizer products were robust  as south american farmers increased their plantings of soybeans in reaction to higher soybean prices 
our nutrient sales volumes increased due to the increased demand for fertilizer raw materials 
cost of goods sold increased due to higher sales volumes and imported raw material costs 
however  the higher costs of imported raw materials were mitigated by our subsidiary  fosfertil s  lower raw material costs since fosfertil produces urea from raw materials not linked to international natural gas prices 
gross profit increased as a result of higher fertilizer selling prices and volumes offset partially by increases in imported raw material costs and the sale of lower margin products 
sg a increased due to certain labor contingencies  increases in information technology and institutional advertising expenses  appreciation in the value of the brazilian real and increases in transactional taxes 
segment operating profit increased primarily due to the increase in gross profit 
included an extra month of segment operating profit of million from fosfertil  which had been reporting its results one month in arrears 
edible oil products segment 
edible oil products segment net sales increased primarily due to a increase in volumes as a result of the cereol acquisition and organic growth in our south american operations 
cost of goods sold increased in from primarily due to the cereol acquisition and higher raw material costs  principally crude soybean oil 
included in cost of goods sold in was a non cash curtailment gain of million relating to the reduction of pension and postretirement healthcare benefits of certain us employees 
included in was a million non cash impairment charge on us long lived operating assets attributable to the planned disposal of a bottling facility 
gross profit increased primarily due to the cereol acquisition and a recovery of margins in our north and south american operations  principally in margarines and mayonnaise attributable to new branding and packaging strategies as well as portfolio rationalization measures 
sg a increased due to the cereol acquisition  partially offset by our cost reduction efforts in our south american operations 
in addition  in  sg a included a non cash curtailment gain of million  relating to the reduction of pension and postretirement healthcare benefits of certain us employees

also  in the latter half of and in may and december  we issued long term debt at relatively higher interest rates to reduce our reliance on short term debt and finance the repayment of a portion of long term debt coming due

 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
liquidity and capital resources our primary financial objective is to maintain sufficient liquidity through a conservative balance sheet that provides flexibility to pursue our growth objectives 
our current ratio  defined as current assets divided by current liabilities  was and at december  and  respectively 
cash and readily marketable inventories 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december  and million at december  included in our inventories were readily marketable inventories of  million at december  and  million at december  readily marketable inventories are agricultural commodity inventories  financed primarily with debt  which are readily convertible to cash because of their commodity characteristics  widely available markets and international pricing mechanisms 
the decrease in readily marketable inventories was primarily due to lower levels of inventory and a decrease in commodity prices compared to december  secured advances to suppliers and prepaid commodity contracts 
we provide financing services to farmers from whom we purchase soybeans and other agricultural commodities through prepaid commodity purchase contracts and advances to farmers 
these arrangements are typically secured by the farmer s crop and mortgages on the farmer s land and other assets  carry a market interest rate  and are typically settled through the delivery of the related crop to us upon harvest 
at december   we had million in prepaid commodity purchase contracts and advances to farmers compared to million at december  the increase is primarily due to the growth in brazilian crop production and higher cost of fertilizer  seed  crop chemicals and other inputs 
the allowance for uncollectible advances totaled million and million at december  and long term and short term debt 
we conduct most of our financing activities through a centralized financing structure  designed to act as our central treasury  which enables us and our subsidiaries to borrow long term and short term debt more efficiently 
this structure includes a master trust facility  the primary assets of which consist of intercompany loans made to bunge limited and its subsidiaries 
bunge limited s wholly owned financing subsidiaries fund the master trust with long and short term debt obtained from third parties  including through our commercial paper program 
to finance working capital  we use cash flows generated from operations and short term borrowings  including our commercial paper program  and various long term bank facilities and bank credit lines  which are sufficient to meet our business needs 
at december   we had approximately  million of committed borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program  other short term lines of credit and long term credit facilities  all of which are with a number of lending institutions

in addition  in july we renewed our million european revolving credit facility with a one year term 
at december   we had million outstanding under our commercial paper program 
our commercial paper program is our least expensive available short term funding source 
we maintain back up bank credit lines equal to the maximum capacity of our commercial paper program of million 
in june  we renewed these lines for a three year term expiring in june if we were unable to access the commercial paper market  we would use these bank credit lines  which would be at a higher cost than our commercial paper 
at december   no amounts were outstanding under these back up bank credit lines 
our short term and long term debt decreased by million at december  from december  primarily due to repayments from cash flows provided by operations 
in april  we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes bearing interest at a rate of per year that mature in april the notes were issued by our wholly owned finance subsidiary  bunge limited finance corp 
and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us 
interest on these unsecured senior notes is payable semi annually in arrears in april and october of each year  commencing in october we used the net proceeds of this offering of million for the repayment of other outstanding indebtedness 
through our subsidiaries  we have various other long term debt facilities at fixed and variable interest rates denominated in both us dollars and brazilian reais  most of which mature between and at december   we had million outstanding under these long term debt facilities 
of this amount  at december   million was secured by certain land  property  plant and equipment and investments in our consolidated subsidiaries  having a net carrying value of million 
our credit facilities and certain senior notes require us to comply with specified financial covenants related to minimum net worth  working capital and a maximum debt to capitalization ratio 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  we do not have any ratings downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of our debt 
however a downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to renew existing or to obtain access to new credit facilities in the future and would increase the cost of such facilities to us 
our credit ratings on our unsecured guaranteed senior notes by moody s investors service  inc moody s at december  were baa with outlook positive  and bbb by standard poor s rating services and fitch rating services 
our commercial paper is rated a by standard poor s rating services  and p by moody s investors service  inc and the interest rates on our commercial paper borrowings are indexed to this rating 
on march   moody s upgraded our credit rating on our unsecured guaranteed senior notes to baa outlook stable 
in june  we entered into various interest rate swap agreements maturing in and for the purpose of managing our interest rate exposure on a portion of our fixed rate debt 
in september  these interest rate swaps were terminated and we received cash of million  comprised of million of accrued interest and a million gain on the net settlement of the interest rate swap agreements 
the million of interest was included as a reduction to interest expense in in the consolidated statements of income and the million gain resulted in an adjustment to the carrying value of the associated debt in the consolidated balance sheets 
the million gain will be amortized to earnings over the remaining term of the debt  which ranges from four to nine years 
the million of cash received was included in the consolidated statements of cash flows as cash provided by operating activities 
concurrent with the september termination of certain of our interest rate swap agreements  we entered into new interest rate swap agreements maturing in and for the purpose of managing our interest rate exposure on a portion of our fixed rate debt 
under the terms of the new interest rate swaps  we make payments based on six month libor in arrears  and we will receive fixed interest rates based on our million aggregate principal amount senior notes due and our million aggregate principal amount senior notes due the interest rate swaps settle every six months until expiration 
accrued interest of million relating to these swaps was recorded as a reduction to interest expense in in the consolidated statements of income 
redeemable preferred stock 
minority interest in subsidiaries on the consolidated balance sheets at december  included million of cumulative variable rate redeemable preferred shares issued by our consolidated subsidiary  bunge first capital limited 
on november  we redeemed the preferred shares for their face value of million plus accrued dividends of million 
shareholders equity 
in june  we sold  common shares in a public offering  which resulted in net proceeds of million  after underwriting discounts  commissions and expenses 
we used million to acquire an additional interest in the capital stock of bunge brasil in the third and fourth quarters of shareholders equity increased to  million at december  from  million at december  as a result of the net proceeds of million from the public offering of common shares  net income of million  other comprehensive income of million  which includes foreign exchange gains of million  and million attributable to the issuance of our common shares upon the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units 
this increase was partially offset by dividends paid to shareholders of million 
guarantees we have issued or were party to the following third party guarantees at december  us in millions maximum potential future payments operating lease residual values unconsolidated affiliates financing customer financing total prior to january   we entered into synthetic lease agreements for barges and railcars originally owned by us and subsequently sold to third parties 
the leases are classified as operating leases in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
any gains on the sales were deferred and are being recognized ratably over the initial lease terms 
we have the option under each lease to purchase the barges or railcars at fixed amounts  based on estimated fair values or to sell the assets 
if we elect to sell  we receive proceeds up to fixed amounts specified in the agreements 
if the proceeds of such sales are less than the specified fixed amounts  we would be obligated under a guarantee to pay supplemental rent for the deficiency in proceeds up to a maximum of approximately million at december  the operating leases expire through there are no recourse provisions or collateral that would enable us to recover any amounts paid under this guarantee 
prior to january   we issued a guarantee to a financial institution related to debt of our joint ventures in argentina  which are our unconsolidated affiliates 
the term of the guarantee is equal to the term of the related financing  which matures in there are no recourse provisions or collateral that would enable us to recover any amounts paid under this guarantee 
we issued guarantees to a financial institution in brazil related to amounts owed the institution by certain of our customers 
the terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms of the related financing arrangements  which can be as short as days or as long as days 
in the event that the customers default on their payments to the institutions and we would be required to perform under the guarantees  we have obtained collateral from the customers 
at december   million of these financing arrangements were collateralized by tangible property 
we have determined the fair value of these guarantees to be immaterial at december  in addition  we have issued parent level guarantees for the repayment of certain senior notes and senior credit facilities which were issued or entered into by our wholly owned subsidiaries  with a carrying amount of  million at december  all outstanding debt related to these guarantees is included in the consolidated balance sheets at december  there are no significant restrictions on the ability of bunge limited finance corp 
or any of our other subsidiaries to transfer funds to us 
also  certain of our subsidiaries have provided guarantees of indebtedness of certain of their subsidiaries under certain lines of credit with various institutions 
the total borrowing capacity under these lines of credit was million as of december   of which million was outstanding as of such date 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in in  major capital projects included the expansion of our brazilian fertilizer mixing and phosphoric acid production capacity  expansion of our grain origination operations in brazil including additional investments in logistics  investments in export terminal operations in argentina  expansion of our oilseed processing capacity in eastern europe and acquisitions of port facilities 
in  major projects included expansion of our edible oil products facilities in europe  the construction of a new margarine plant and an oilseed processing plant in brazil  logistics investments  primarily in brazil  expansion of our grain origination facilities in brazil and expansion of our fertilizer mixing capacity

we intend to fund these capital expenditures with cash flows from operations and available borrowings 
cash flows compared to in  our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased by million  reflecting the net impact of cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  compared to a million increase in our cash and cash equivalents balance in cash flow provided by operating activities for was million compared to cash used for operating activities of million in our cash flow from operations has varied depending on the timing of the acquisition of  and the market prices for  agricultural commodity inventories  as well as the timing of when such inventories were sold 
in addition  the growth of our business has resulted in the need to increase working capital levels which reduces our cash flow from operations 
the second and third quarters of the year are typically the periods when most of our cash flows from operations are provided 
it is during this period that north american and european old crop inventories harvested and purchased in september  october and november of the previous year are at their lowest level 
in addition  most of the south american inventories acquired during the march  april and may harvest period have been sold 
cash flows from operations during the first and fourth quarters will vary depending upon the amount of advances made to farmers in brazil and the amount of north american and european new crops purchased during the september  october and november harvest period 
cash flow from operations in was favorably affected by the strong operating results and the return of soybean prices to more normalized levels in the latter part of the year 
soybean prices increased significantly beginning in the third quarter of and continued their increase into during the latter half of the third quarter of  agricultural prices declined  which resulted in a reduction in working capital levels

and no 
we have applied eitf issue no 
and the proposed fsp no 
fas a and a to our consolidated balance sheets beginning in the first quarter of and have reclassified the prior period consolidated balance sheet to conform to the presentation 
the reclassification at december  was million  resulting in an increase to property  plant and equipment  net and a corresponding decrease in other intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheets

fas 
the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of the act to which fsp no 
fas relates  which was signed into law in december  introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare as well as a federal subsidy  under certain conditions  to sponsors of retiree healthcare benefit plans 
we have elected a one time deferral of the accounting for the effects of the act  as permitted by fsp no 
fas in may  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas  which superceded fsp no 
fas fsp no 
fas is effective for us for the year ended december  and allows two alternate methods of transition  retroactive application to the date of enactment of the act or prospective application from the date of adoption of this statement 
fsp no 
fas requires a remeasurement of the applicable plans assets and benefit obligations at the applicable date 
we have determined that the effects of the act are not a significant event for us and not material to our financial position or results of operations 
using the guidance issued in january on the definition of actuarially equivalent  we believe that the prescription drug benefits we provide will be actuarially equivalent 
based on this assumption  the estimated subsidy resulting from the act is incorporated prospectively into our postretirement healthcare benefit plan obligation as of the measurement date as an actuarial gain 
the effect of the federal subsidy on the accumulated benefit obligation of our postretirement healthcare benefit plans was approximately million  which was reflected in the benefit obligation as of december  the effect of the federal subsidy on future annual expense of our postretirement healthcare benefit plans is insignificant 
in  the fasb eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share issue no 
 that contingently convertible instruments  which generally become convertible into common stock only if one or more events occur  such as the underlying common stock achieving a specified market price target  should be included in diluted earnings per share computations if dilutive regardless of whether the market price target or other contingent features have been met 
the eitf concluded that issue no 
would be applied by restating diluted earnings per share for all prior periods presented 
issue no 
is effective for periods ending after december  we have applied issue no 
to our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  and have restated diluted earnings per share for the years ended december  and to include the weighted average common shares that are issuable upon the conversion of our convertible notes

pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no

in december  the fasb deferred the issuance of their final standard on earnings per share sfas no 
r  earnings per share  an amendment to fas the final standard will be effective in and will require retrospective application for all prior periods presented 
the significant proposed changes to the eps computation are changes to the treasury stock method and contingent share guidance for computing year to date diluted eps  removal of the ability to overcome the presumption of share settlement when computing diluted eps when there is a choice of share or cash settlement and inclusion of mandatorily convertible securities in basic eps 
we are currently evaluating the proposed provisions of this amendment to determine the impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  provided an exception to its basic measurement principle fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets 
under apb opinion no 
 an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset was based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished 
sfas no 
eliminates this exception and replaces it with an exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas no 
is effective prospectively for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  in december  the fasb issued proposed fsp no 
fas b  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law by the president and includes a provision that allows us corporations  in certain circumstances  to repatriate cumulative non us earnings at tax rates that may be below the us statutory rate 
fsp no 
b is intended to provide limited relief in the application of the indefinite reinvestment criterion of apb  accounting for income taxes special areas  due to ambiguities surrounding the implementation of the act and is effective upon issuance 
we are currently reviewing this provision of the act and have not completed our evaluation of the provision s effect on us 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
 to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage relating to inventory pricing 
sfas no 
requires that such items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal and requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the guidance is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we have determined that sfas no 
will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have two accounts receivable securitization facilities 
through agreements with certain financial institutions  we may sell  on a revolving basis  undivided percentage ownership interests in designated pools of our accounts receivable  without recourse  up to a maximum amount of approximately million as of december  collections reduce accounts receivable included in the pools  and are used to purchase new receivables  which become part of the pools 
one of the facilities expires in  with an option for renewal  and the other facility expires in the effective yield rates approximate the day commercial paper rate plus annual commitment fees ranging from to basis points 
during and  the outstanding undivided interests averaged million and million  respectively 
we retain collection and administrative responsibilities for the accounts receivable in the pools 
in and  we recognized million and million  respectively  in related charges  which are included in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
in addition  we retain interests in the pools of accounts receivable not sold 
due to the short term nature of the accounts receivable  our retained interests in the pools are valued at historical cost  which approximate fair value 
the full amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts has been retained in our consolidated balance sheets since collections of all pooled accounts receivable are first used to reduce the outstanding undivided interests 
at december   there were no undivided interests in the pooled receivables outstanding 
accounts receivable at december  were net of million  representing the outstanding undivided interests in pooled accounts receivable 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual obligations and their expected maturities at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in the future periods indicated 
december  contractual obligations total less than year years years after years us in millions commercial paper borrowings other short term borrowings long term debt   freight supply agreements   non cancelable lease obligations inventory purchase commitments total contractual obligations    we also have interest obligations on our outstanding borrowings 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into purchase commitments for time on ocean freight vessels and freight service on railroad lines for the purpose of transporting agricultural commodities 
in addition  we sell time on these ocean freight vessels when excess freight capacity is available 
these agreements range from two months to six years in the case of ocean freight vessels and to years in the case of railroad services 
actual amounts paid under these contracts may differ due to the variable components of these agreements and the amount of income earned by us on the sale of excess capacity 
the cost of our freight supply agreements is passed through to our customers in the ordinary course of business  and as a result  such amounts are expected to be fully recovered 
employee benefit plans we expect to contribute million to our defined benefit pension plans and million to our postretirement healthcare benefit plans in risk factors our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the risks and uncertainties described below 
additional risks not presently known to us  or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our financial condition and business operations 
risks relating to our business and industries the availability and demand for the agricultural commodities and agricultural commodity products that we use and sell in our business can be affected by weather  disease and other factors beyond our control 
weather conditions have historically caused volatility in the agricultural commodities industry and consequently in our operating results by causing crop failures or significantly reduced harvests  which can affect the supply and pricing of the agricultural commodities that we sell and use in our business  reduce the demand for our fertilizer products and negatively affect the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers 
reduced supply of agricultural commodities due to weather related factors could adversely affect our profitability 
in addition  the supply of agricultural commodities can be affected by other factors such as plant disease  including asian soybean rust  which has recently affected soybean crops in brazil and the united states 
our operating results can also be influenced by sudden shifts in demand for our primary products due to factors such as livestock and other animal disease  including avian influenza 
we are vulnerable to cyclicality in the oilseed processing industry and increases in raw material prices 
in the oilseed processing industry  the lead time required to build an oilseed processing plant can make it difficult to time capacity additions with market demand for oilseed products such as soybean meal and oil 
when additional processing capacity becomes operational  a temporary imbalance between the supply and demand for oilseed processing capacity might exist  which until it is corrected  negatively impacts oilseed processing margins 
oilseed processing margins will continue to fluctuate following industry cycles  which could negatively impact our profitability 
our food products and fertilizer divisions may also be adversely affected by increases in the price of agricultural commodities and fertilizer raw materials that are caused by market fluctuations outside of our control 
as a result of competitive conditions in our food products businesses  we may not be able to recoup increases in the cost of raw materials through increases in sales prices for our products  which would adversely affect our profitability 
in addition  increases in fertilizer prices due to higher raw material costs could adversely affect demand for our products 
we are subject to economic and political instability and other risks of doing business globally and in emerging markets 
we are a global business with substantial assets located outside of the united states from which we derive a significant portion of our revenue 
our operations in south america and europe are a fundamental part of our business 
in addition  a key part of our strategy involves expanding our business in several emerging markets  including eastern europe  india and china 
volatile economic  political and market conditions in these and other emerging market countries may have a negative impact on our operating results and our ability to achieve our business strategies 
we are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations because a portion of our net sales and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
our financial performance may be negatively or positively affected by currency fluctuations 
for example  changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies  particularly the brazilian real  the argentine peso and the european euro  affect our expenses that are denominated in local currencies and may have a negative impact on the value of our assets located outside of the united states 
we are also exposed to other risks of international operations  including increased governmental ownership  including through expropriation  and regulation of the economy in the markets where we operate  inflation and adverse economic conditions resulting from governmental attempts to reduce inflation  such as imposition of higher interest rates and wage and price controls  trade barriers on imports or exports  such as higher tariffs and taxes on imports of agricultural commodities and commodity products  changes in the tax laws or inconsistent tax regulations in the countries where we operate  exchange controls or other currency restrictions  and civil unrest or significant political instability 
the occurrence of any of these events in the markets where we operate or in other markets where we plan to expand or develop our business could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business in those markets and could adversely affect our revenues and operating results 
government policies and regulations affecting the agricultural sector and related industries could adversely affect our operations and profitability 
agricultural production and trade flows are significantly affected by government policies and regulations 
governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry  such as taxes  tariffs  duties  subsidies and import and export restrictions on agricultural commodities and commodity products  can influence industry profitability  the planting of certain crops versus other uses of agricultural resources  the location and size of crop production  whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded and the volume and types of imports and exports 
for example  in mid  a trade dispute between china and brazil temporarily halted soybean trade between the two countries  which adversely affected our sales to asia 
future government policies may adversely affect the supply  demand for and prices of our products  restrict our ability to do business in our existing and target markets and could cause our financial results to suffer 
we are dependent on access to external sources of financing to acquire and maintain the inventory  facilities and equipment necessary to run our business 
we require significant amounts of capital to operate our business and fund capital expenditures 
we require significant working capital to purchase  process and market our agricultural commodities inventories 
an interruption of our access to short term credit or a significant increase in our cost of credit could materially increase our interest expense and impair our ability to compete effectively in our business 
we operate an extensive network of storage facilities  processing plants  refineries  mills  mines  ports  transportation assets and other facilities as part of our business 
we are required to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain  upgrade and expand these facilities to keep pace with competitive developments  technological advances and changing safety standards in our industry 
significant unbudgeted increases in our capital expenditures could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  if we are unable to continue devoting substantial resources to maintaining and enhancing our infrastructure  we may not be able to compete effectively 
our future funding requirements will depend  in large part  on our working capital requirements and the nature of our capital expenditures 
in addition  the expansion of our business and pursuit of business opportunities may require us to have access to significant amounts of capital 
as of december   we had  million in total indebtedness 
our indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain additional financing  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in the markets in which we compete  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged than we are and require us to dedicate more cash on a relative basis to servicing our debt and less to developing our business 
this may limit our ability to run our business and use our resources in the manner in which we would like 
our risk management strategy may not be effective 
our business is affected by fluctuations in agricultural commodities prices  freight rates  energy prices  interest rates and in foreign currency exchange rates 
we engage in hedging transactions to manage these risks 
however  our hedging strategy may not be successful in minimizing our exposure to these fluctuations 
in addition  our control procedures and risk management policies may not successfully prevent our traders from entering into unauthorized transactions that have the potential to impair our financial position 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the expansion of our business through acquisitions and strategic alliances poses risks that may reduce the benefits we anticipate from these transactions 
we have been an active acquirer of other companies  and we have strategic alliances and joint ventures with several partners 
part of our strategy involves acquisitions  alliances and joint ventures designed to expand and enhance our business 
our ability to benefit from acquisitions and alliances depends on many factors  including our ability to identify acquisition or alliance prospects  access capital markets at an acceptable cost of capital  negotiate favorable transaction terms and successfully integrate any businesses we acquire 
integrating businesses we acquire into our operational framework may involve unanticipated delays  costs and other operational problems 
if we encounter unexpected problems with one of our acquisitions or alliances  our senior management may be required to divert attention away from other aspects of our businesses to address these problems 
acquisitions also pose the risk that we may be exposed to successor liability relating to actions by an acquired company and its management before the acquisition 
the due diligence we conduct in connection with an acquisition  and any contractual guarantees or indemnities that we receive from the sellers of acquired companies  may not be sufficient to protect us from  or compensate us for  actual liabilities 
a material liability associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations and reduce the benefits of the acquisition 
we could lose customers and incur liability if we fail to properly label or separate products that contain genetically modified organisms from those that do not 
the use of genetically modified organisms gmos in food and animal feed has been met with varying acceptance in the different markets in which we operate 
the united states and argentina have approved the use of gmos in food products and animal feed  and gmo and non gmo grain are frequently commingled during the grain origination process 
however  in some of the markets where we sell our products  most significantly the european union and brazil  government regulations limit sales or require labeling of gmo products 
in brazil  the government is expected to legalize the planting and sale of gmo soybeans after having temporarily legalized such planting and sale in certain regions for the past two years 
however  certain brazilian states have banned the planting  sale or transport of gmo crops  which has resulted in the disruption of certain gmo crop shipments 
we may inadvertently deliver products that contain gmos to customers that request gmo free products 
as a result  we could lose customers  incur liability and damage our reputation 
we face intense competition in each of our divisions  particularly in our agribusiness and food products divisions 
we face significant competition in each of our divisions  particularly in our agribusiness and food products divisions 
we have numerous competitors  some of which may be larger and have greater financial resources than we have 
in addition  we face significant competitive challenges outlined below 
agribusiness 
the markets for our products are highly price competitive and are sensitive to product substitution 
we compete against large multinational  regional and national suppliers  processors and distributors and farm cooperatives 
our principal competitors are adm  cargill and  to a lesser extent  local  large agricultural cooperatives and trading companies  such as louis dreyfus group 
competition with these and other suppliers  processors and distributors is based on price  service offerings and geographic location 
food products 
several of the markets in which our food products division operates  particularly those in which we sell consumer products  are mature and highly competitive 
in addition  consolidation in the supermarket industry has resulted in our retail customers demanding lower prices and reducing the number of suppliers with which they do business 
to compete effectively in our food products division  we must establish and maintain favorable brand recognition  efficiently manage distribution  gain sufficient market share  develop products sought by consumers and other customers  implement appropriate pricing  provide marketing support and obtain access to retail outlets and sufficient shelf space for our retail products 
in addition  sales of our soybean oil products could be subject to increased competition as a result of the recent adverse publicity associated with trans fatty acids 
if our customers switch to products that do not contain trans fatty acids or our competitors are able to offer or develop additional low trans fatty acid products more economically or quickly than we can  our competitive position could suffer and our edible oil segment revenues could be negatively affected 
competition could cause us to lose market share  exit certain lines of business  increase expenditures or reduce pricing  each of which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
we are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions and may be exposed to liability as a result of our handling of hazardous materials and commodities storage operations 
our business involves the handling and use of hazardous materials 
the use of such materials in processing our products can cause the emission of certain regulated substances 
in addition  the storage and processing of our products may create hazardous conditions 
for example  we use hexane in our oilseed processing operations  and hexane can cause explosions that could harm our employees or damage our facilities 
our agricultural commodities storage operations also create dust that has caused explosions in our grain elevators 
in addition  our mining operations and manufacturing of fertilizers require compliance with environmental regulations 
our operations are regulated by environmental laws and regulations in the countries where we operate  including those governing the labeling  use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous materials 
these laws and regulations require us to implement procedures for the handling of hazardous materials and for operating in potentially hazardous conditions  and they impose liability on us for the cleanup of any environmental contamination 
in addition  brazilian law allocates liability for noncompliance with environmental laws by an acquired company to the acquiror for an indefinite period of time 
because we use and handle hazardous substances in our business  changes in environmental requirements or an unanticipated significant adverse environmental event could have a material adverse effect on our business 
see item business government regulation and item business environmental matters 
we advance significant capital and provide other financing arrangements to farmers in brazil and  as a result  our business and financial results may be adversely affected if these farmers are unable to repay the capital we have advanced to them 
in brazil  where there are fewer third party financing sources available to farmers  we provide financing services to farmers from whom we purchase soybeans and other agricultural commodities through prepaid commodity purchase contracts and advances to farmers  which are typically secured by the farmer s crop and a mortgage on the farmer s land and other assets 
the purchase contracts and advances are typically settled through the delivery of the related crop to us upon harvest 
in  due to the higher costs of fertilizer  seed  crop chemicals and other inputs  as well as the growth in brazilian soybean production  we advanced funds to farmers in greater amounts under these arrangements than we have in the past 
at december  we had approximately million in prepaid commodity purchase contracts and advances to the farmers  as compared to approximately million at december  as our exposure under these financial arrangements increases  we will be increasingly exposed to the risks that the underlying crop will be unable to satisfy a farmer s obligation under the financing arrangements as a result of weather and crop growing conditions  fluctuations in commodity prices and other factors that influence the price  supply and demand for agricultural commodities 
in addition  we sell fertilizer on credit to farmers in brazil 
during  approximately of our fertilizer sales were made on credit  which represents an approximate increase compared to furthermore  in connection with our fertilizer sales  we issue guarantees to a financial institution in brazil related to amounts owed the institution by certain of our farmer customers 
for additional information on our guarantees see note to our consolidated financial statements included as part of this annual report on form k 
in the event that the customers default on their payments to us or the financial institution under these financing arrangements  we would be required to recognize the associated bad debt expense or perform under the guarantees  as the case may be 
although our prior loss experience has been small  significant defaults by farmers under these financial arrangements could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
risks relating to our common shares we are a bermuda company  and it may be difficult for you to enforce judgments against us and our directors and executive officers 
we are a bermuda exempted company 
as a result  the rights of holders of our common shares will be governed by bermuda law and our memorandum of association and bye laws 
the rights of shareholders under bermuda law may differ from the rights of shareholders of companies or corporations incorporated in other jurisdictions 
most of our directors and some of our officers are not residents of the united states  and a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of those directors and officers are located outside the united states 
as a result  it may be difficult for you to effect service of process on those persons in the united states or to enforce in the us judgments obtained in us courts against us or those persons based on civil liability provisions of the us securities laws 
we have been advised by our bermuda counsel  conyers dill pearman  that uncertainty exists as to whether courts in bermuda will enforce judgments obtained in other jurisdictions  including the united states  against us or our directors or officers under the securities laws of those jurisdictions or entertain actions in bermuda against us or our directors or officers under the securities laws of other jurisdictions 
our bye laws restrict shareholders from bringing legal action against our officers and directors 
our bye laws contain a broad waiver by our shareholders of any claim or right of action  both individually and on our behalf  against any of our officers or directors 
the waiver applies to any action taken by an officer or director  or the failure of an officer or director to take any action  in the performance of his or her duties  except with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the officer or director 
this waiver limits the right of shareholders to assert claims against our officers and directors unless the act or failure to act involves fraud or dishonesty 
we have anti takeover provisions in our bye laws and have adopted a shareholder rights plan that may discourage a change of control 
our bye laws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions provide for a classified board of directors with staggered three year terms  directors to be removed without cause only upon the affirmative vote of at least of all votes attaching to all shares then in issue entitling the holder to attend and vote on the resolution  restrictions on the time period in which directors may be nominated  our board of directors to determine the powers  preferences and rights of our preference shares and to issue the preference shares without shareholder approval  and an affirmative vote of of all votes attaching to all shares then in issue entitling the holder to attend and vote on the resolution for some business combination transactions  which have not been approved by our board of directors 
in addition  we have a shareholder rights plan which will entitle shareholders to purchase our series a preference shares if a third party acquires beneficial ownership of or more of our common shares 
in some circumstances  shareholders are also entitled to purchase the common stock of a company issuing shares in exchange for our common shares in a merger  amalgamation or tender offer or a company acquiring most of our assets 
these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if the third party s offer may be considered beneficial by many shareholders 
as a result  shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares 
we may become a passive foreign investment company  which could result in adverse us tax consequences to us investors 
adverse us federal income tax rules apply to individuals owning shares of a passive foreign investment company  or pfic  directly or indirectly including by holding an option to acquire shares of a pfic  such as a debt security convertible into shares 
we will be classified as a pfic for us federal income tax purposes if or more of our assets  including goodwill based on an annual quarterly average  are passive assets  or or more of our annual gross income is derived from passive assets 
the calculation of goodwill will be based  in part  on the then market value of our common shares  which is subject to change 
based on certain estimates of our gross income and gross assets available as of december  and relying on certain exceptions in the applicable us treasury regulations  we do not believe that we are currently a pfic 
such a characterization could result in adverse us tax consequences to us investors in our common shares and our convertible notes due in particular  absent an election described below  a us investor would be subject to us federal income tax at ordinary income tax rates  plus a possible interest charge  in respect of gain derived from a disposition of our shares  as well as certain distributions by us 
in addition  a step up in the tax basis of our shares would not be available upon the death of an individual shareholder  and the preferential us federal income tax rates generally applicable to qualified dividend income of certain us investors would not apply 
since pfic status is determined by us on an annual basis and will depend on the composition of our income and assets and the nature of our activities from time to time  we cannot assure you that we will not be considered a pfic for the current or any future taxable year 
if we are treated as a pfic for any taxable year  us investors may desire to make an election to treat us as a qualified electing fund with respect to shares owned a qef election  in which case us investors will be required to take into account a pro rata share of our earnings and net capital gain for each year  regardless of whether we make any distributions 
as an alternative to the qef election  a us investor may be able to make an election to mark to market our shares each taxable year and recognize ordinary income pursuant to such election based upon increases in the value of our shares 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management as a result of our global operating and financing activities  we are exposed to changes in agricultural commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and energy and transportation costs which may affect our results of operations and financial position 
we use derivative financial instruments for the purpose of managing the risks and or costs associated with fluctuations in commodity prices  foreign exchange  interest rates and transportation costs 
while these hedging instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  those fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged 
the counter parties to these contractual arrangements are primarily major financial institutions or  in the case of commodity futures and options  a commodity exchange 
as a result  credit risk arising from these contracts is not significant and we do not anticipate any significant losses 
our board of directors finance and risk management committee supervises  reviews and periodically revises our overall risk management policies and risk limits 
we only enter into derivatives that are related to our inherent business and financial exposure as a global agribusiness company 
commodities risk we operate in many areas of the food industry from agricultural raw materials to the production and sale of branded food products 
as a result  we use and produce various materials  many of which are agricultural commodities  including soybeans  soybean oil  soybean meal  wheat and corn 
agricultural commodities are subject to price fluctuations due to a number of unpredictable factors that may create price risk 
we are also subject to the risk of counter party defaults under forward purchase or sale contracts 
we enter into various derivative contracts  primarily exchange traded futures  with the objective of managing our exposure to adverse price movements in the agricultural commodities used for our business operations 
we have established policies that limit the amount of unhedged fixed price agricultural commodity positions permissible for our operating companies  which are a combination of quantity and value at risk limits 
we measure and review our sensitivity to our net commodities position on a daily basis 
we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our daily exposure to market risk on our agricultural commodity position 
the daily net agricultural commodity position consists of inventory  related purchase and sale contracts  and exchange traded contracts  including those used to hedge portions of our production requirements 
the fair value of that position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each agricultural commodity by valuing each net position at quoted average futures prices for the period 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in prices 
the results of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  are as follows year ended december  year ended december  us in millions fair value market risk fair value market risk highest long position highest short position currency risk our global operations require active participation in foreign exchange markets 
to reduce the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations  we follow a policy of hedging net monetary assets and liabilities and transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies applicable to each of our various subsidiaries 
our primary exposure is related to our businesses located in brazil and argentina and to a lesser extent  europe and asia 
to minimize the adverse impact of currency movements  we enter into foreign exchange swaps and option contracts to hedge currency exposures 
when determining our exposure  we exclude intercompany loans that are deemed to be permanently invested 
the repayments of permanently invested intercompany loans are not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future and therefore are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
as a result  the foreign exchange gains and losses on these borrowings are excluded from the determination of net income and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the balance of permanently invested intercompany borrowings was million as of december  and million as of december  the balance of permanently invested intercompany borrowings increased million in september as a result of the acquisition of an additional interest in the outstanding shares of bunge brasil 
included in other comprehensive income loss are foreign exchange gains of million in the year ended december  and foreign exchange gains of million in the year ended december   related to permanently invested intercompany loans 
for risk management purposes and to determine the overall level of hedging required  we further reduce the foreign exchange exposure determined above by the value of our agricultural commodities inventories 
our agricultural commodities inventories  because of their international pricing in us dollars  provide a natural hedge to our currency exposure 
our net currency positions  including currency derivatives  and our market risk  which is the potential loss from an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates  are set forth in the following table 
in addition  we have provided an analysis of our foreign currency exposure after reducing the exposure for our agricultural commodities inventory 
actual results may differ from the information set forth below

we are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
of our total long term debt outstanding of  million at december  including current maturities   million was fixed rate 
long term debt that is exposed to interest rate risk at december  is listed below

bndes loans are brazilian government industrial development loans 
igpm is a brazilian inflation index published by fundac o getulio vargas 
the annualized rate for the year ended december  was an increase in the interest rates on our long term variable rate debt based on a change in the libor and igpm rates at december  would increase the interest rates on our variable rate debt between to basis points  which would have no material effect on our operating results 
in addition to long term debt  we have variable interest rate short term debt and commercial paper with a balance of million at december  the short term debt is predominantly held with commercial banks and the interest rates are generally based on libor plus a spread of to 
our commercial paper is rated a by standard poor s rating services and p by moody s investors service  inc and the interest rates on our commercial paper borrowings are indexed to this rating 
an increase in interest rates on our short term debt based on a change in libor and a change in the commercial paper interest rate for a p rated commercial paper at december  would increase the interest rate on our variable rate short term debt approximately basis points  which would have no material effect on our operating results 
interest rate derivatives in september  we entered into treasury rate lock agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million at a year treasury yield of with a settlement date of march the treasury rate lock agreements were not designated as hedging instruments 
in the fourth quarter of  we terminated these treasury rate lock agreements 
we recorded a gain in other income expense net in the consolidated statements of income of approximately million relating to the cash settlement received on these derivative agreements for the year ended december  in june  we entered into various interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate exposure on a portion of our fixed rate debt 
these swap agreements had an aggregate notional amount of billion at weighted average fixed rates receivable of and and weighted average variable rates payable of and  with maturity dates of and these interest rate swap agreements were accounted for as fair value hedges 
in september  we terminated the june swap agreements and received million in cash  which was comprised of million of accrued interest and a million gain on the net settlement of the june swap agreements 
the million of accrued interest was recorded as a reduction of interest expense for the year ended december  in the consolidated statements of income and the million gain was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the related debt for the year ended december  in the consolidated balance sheet 
the million gain will be amortized to earnings over the remaining term of the debt  which ranges from four to nine years 
concurrent with the september termination of the june swap agreements  we entered into various new interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate exposure on a portion of our fixed rate debt 
we have accounted for these new swap agreements as fair value hedges 
the interest rate swaps used by us as derivative hedging instruments have been recorded at fair value in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded currently in earnings 
additionally  the carrying amount of the associated debt is adjusted through earnings for changes in the fair value due to changes in interest rates 
ineffectiveness is recognized to the extent that these two adjustments do not offset 
as of december   we recognized no ineffectiveness related to the interest rate swap hedging instruments 
the derivatives we entered into for hedge purposes are assumed to be perfectly effective under the shortcut method of sfas no 
the differential to be paid or received on changes in interest rates is recorded as an adjustment to interest expense 
the interest rate swaps settle every six months until expiration 
we recorded million of accrued interest as a reduction of interest expense in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december the following table summarizes our outstanding interest rate swap agreements as of december  fair value maturity us in millions december  total receive fixed pay variable notional amount  weighted average variable rate payable weighted average fixed rate receivable interest is payable in arrears based on a forecasted rate of six month libor plus a spread
