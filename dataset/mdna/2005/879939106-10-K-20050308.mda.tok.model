item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
risk factors you should not construe the following cautionary statements as an exhaustive list 
we cannot always predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward looking statements 
all cautionary statements should be read as being applicable to all forward looking statements wherever they appear 
we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed herein might not occur 
forward looking information may prove to be inaccurate 
some of the information presented in this annual report on form k constitutes forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements that include terms such as may  will  intend  anticipate  estimate  expect  continue  believe  plan  or the like  as well as all statements that are not historical facts 
forward looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations 
although we believe our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations  there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from expectations 
factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations or have a material adverse effect upon our business include our revenues are generated from a limited number of clients 
we rely on strategic  long term relationships with large  global companies in targeted industries 
as a result  we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from relatively few clients 
additionally  client consolidations could result in a loss of clients 
there can be no assurance that we will not become more dependent on a few significant clients  that we will be able to retain any of our largest clients  that the volumes or profit margins of our most significant programs will not be reduced  or that we would be able to replace such clients or programs with clients or programs that generate comparable revenue and profits 
our business may be affected by the success of our clients 
in substantially all of our client programs  we generate revenue based  in large part  on the amount of time our personnel devote to a client s customers 
consequently  the amount of revenue generated from any particular client program is dependent upon consumers interest in  and use of  the client s products and or services 
there can be no assurance that our clients will continue to market products and services or develop new products and services that require them to use our services 
our financial results may be adversely impacted by the global economy 
our ability to enter into new multi year contracts with large clients may be impacted by the general macroeconomic environment in which our clients and their customers operate 
weakening economic conditions  both global and local in nature  could result in increased sales cycles  delays in finalizing new business opportunities  slower growth and reduced revenues from existing contracts 
an economic downturn could negatively impact the financial condition of our clients  thereby increasing our risk of not receiving payment for services 
there can be no assurance that weakening economic conditions or acts of terrorism throughout the world will not adversely impact our results of operations and or financial position 
our business is subject to federal  state and international regulations 
changes in us federal  state and international outsourcing requirements  restrictions and disclosures may affect the sale of our services  including expansion of overseas operations 
in the us  some of our services must comply with various federal and state requirements and regulations regarding the method and practices of placing outbound telephone calls 
there can be no assurance that changes in these regulations and requirements or new restrictive regulations and requirements  will not slow growth of these services or require us to incur substantial costs 
our success is subject to the terms of our contracts 
most of our contracts do not ensure that we will generate a minimum level of revenue  and the profitability of each client program may fluctuate  sometimes significantly  throughout the various stages of a program 
our objective is to sign multi year contracts with our clients 
however  our contracts generally enable the clients to terminate the contract or reduce customer interaction volumes 
our larger contracts generally require the client to pay a contractually agreed amount in the event of early termination 
additionally  certain contracts have performance related bonus and or penalty provisions  whereby the client may pay us a bonus or we may have to issue a credit based upon our ability to meet agreed upon performance metrics 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to collect early termination fees  avoid performance penalties or earn performance bonuses 

table of contents our business may be subject to sales and use tax liabilities 
we may be subject to past and future sales or use tax liabilities 
use taxes are generally borne by the company and are considered a cost of doing business 
if we determine that we have significant past or future obligations  it could have an adverse affect on future results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in passing sales tax through to our clients 
our business may be affected by our ability to obtain financing 
from time to time  we may need to obtain debt or equity financing for capital expenditures  for payment of existing obligations or to replenish cash reserves 
additionally  our existing debt agreements require us to comply with certain financial covenants 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain debt or equity financing  or that any such financing would be on terms acceptable to us 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the financial covenants under our debt agreements or  in the event of noncompliance  will be able to obtain waivers or amendments from the lenders 
our business may be affected by risks associated with international operations and expansion 
one component of our growth strategy is continued international expansion 
there are certain risks inherent with conducting international business including longer payment cycles  difficulties in accounts receivable collections  difficulties in complying with foreign laws  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  political and social instability and potentially adverse tax consequences 
any one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our international operations and  consequently  on our business  consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial condition 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our international operations successfully 
our financial results maybe impacted by our ability to find new locations 
our future success will be dependent upon being able to find cost effective locations in which to operate  both domestically and internationally 
there is no assurance that we will be able to find cost effective locations  obtain favorable lease terms and build or retrofit facilities in a timely or economic manner 
our financial results may be adversely affected by increases in business costs 
some of our larger contracts allow us to increase our service fees if  and to the extent  certain cost or price indices increase 
the majority of our expenses are payroll and payroll related  which includes healthcare costs 
over the past several years  healthcare costs have increased at a rate much greater than that of general cost or price indices 
increases in our service fees that are based upon increases in cost or price indices may not fully compensate us for increases in labor and other costs incurred in providing services 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover increases in our costs through increased service fees 
our financial results depend on our ability to manage capacity utilization 
our profitability is influenced significantly by our cmc capacity utilization 
we attempt to maximize utilization  however  because the majority of our business is inbound  we have significantly higher utilization during peak weekday periods than during off peak night and weekend periods 
we have experienced periods of idle capacity  particularly in our multi client cmcs 
historically  we experience idle peak period capacity upon opening a new cmc or termination or completion of a large client program 
we assess the expected long term capacity utilization of our centers quarterly 
we may consolidate or close under performing centers in order to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins 
in the event we close cmcs in the future  we may be required to record restructuring or impairment charges  which would adversely impact our results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain optimal cmc capacity utilization 
our business operates in a highly competitive market 
the market in which we operate is fragmented and highly competitive and that competition may intensify in the future 
we compete with small firms offering specific applications  divisions of large entities  large independent firms and  most significantly  the in house operations of clients or potential clients 
a number of competitors may develop greater capabilities and resources than ours 
because our primary competitors are the in house operations of existing or potential clients  our performance and growth could be adversely affected if our existing or potential clients decide to provide in house customer management services they currently outsource  or retain or increase their in house customer service and product support capabilities 
in addition  competitive pressures from current or future competitors also could cause our services to lose market acceptance or result in significant price erosion  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  results of operations and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that additional competitors  some with greater resources than ours  will not enter our market 
our future success requires continued growth 
continued future growth will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to  i initiate  develop and maintain new client relationships  ii expand existing client programs  iii rapidly staff and equip suitable cmc facilities  and iv develop new solutions and enhance existing solutions we provide to our clients 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively manage expanded operations or maintain our profitability 

table of contents our financial results may be affected by rapidly changing technology 
our business is highly dependent on our computer and telecommunications equipment and software capabilities 
our failure to maintain our technological capabilities or to respond effectively to technological changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial condition 
our continued growth and future profitability will be highly dependent on a number of factors  including our ability to  i expand our existing solutions offerings  ii achieve cost efficiencies in our existing cmc operations  and iii introduce new solutions that leverage and respond to changing technological developments 
our ability to effectively market and implement software solutions developed by our database marketing and consulting segment  including recoverability of capitalized costs based on estimated future cash flows  is a factor in our future success 
there can be no assurance that technologies or services developed by our competitors will not render our products or services non competitive or obsolete  that we can successfully develop and market any new services or products  that any such new services or products will be commercially successful or that the integration of automated customer support capabilities will achieve their intended cost reductions 
our success depends on key personnel 
our success will depend upon our ability to recruit  hire and retain experienced executive personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to hire  motivate and retain highly effective executive employees on economically feasible terms 
our business is dependent on our ability to maintain our workforce 
our success is largely dependent on our ability to recruit  hire  train and retain qualified employees 
our industry is labor intensive and experiences high personnel turnover 
a significant increase in the employee turnover rate could increase recruiting and training costs  thereby decreasing operating effectiveness and productivity 
also  if we obtain several significant new clients or implement several new  large scale programs  we may need to recruit  hire and train qualified personnel at an accelerated rate 
we may not be able to continue to hire  train and retain sufficient qualified personnel to adequately staff new customer management programs 
in addition  certain cmcs are located in geographic areas with relatively low unemployment rates  which could make it more difficult and costly to hire qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able maintain our workforce at necessary levels 
our success may be affected by our ability to complete and integrate acquisitions and joint ventures 
we may pursue strategic acquisitions of companies with services  technologies  industry specializations or geographic coverage that extend or complement our existing business 
we may face increased competition for acquisition opportunities  which may inhibit our ability to complete suitable acquisitions on favorable terms 
we may pursue strategic alliances in the form of joint ventures and partnerships  which involve many of the same risks as acquisitions as well as additional risks associated with possible lack of control if we do not have a majority ownership position 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in integrating acquisitions or joint ventures into our existing businesses  or that any acquisition or joint venture will enhance our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our business depends on uninterrupted service to clients 
our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our locations computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems against damage or interruption from fire  power loss  cyber attacks  telecommunications interruption or failure  natural disaster and other similar events 
our operations may also be adversely affected by damage to our facilities resulting from fire  natural disaster or other events 
additionally  severe weather can cause interruption in our ability to deliver our services  such as when our employees cannot attend work  resulting in a loss of revenue 
in the event we experience a temporary or permanent interruption at one or more of our locations including our corporate headquarters building  through the reasons noted above or otherwise  our business could be materially adversely affected and we may be required to pay contractual damages or face the loss of some clients altogether 
we maintain property and business interruption insurance 
however  there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately compensate us for any losses we may incur 
our financial results may experience variability 
we experience quarterly variations in operating results because of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
in addition  we make decisions regarding staffing levels  investments and other operating expenditures based on our revenue forecasts 
if our revenue is below expectations in any given quarter  our operating results for that quarter would likely be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that future quarterly or annual operating results will reflect past operating results 
our financial results may be impacted by foreign currency exchange risk 
we serve an increasing number of our us clients from cmcs in canada  argentina  mexico and the philippines 
contracts with these clients are typically priced in us dollars while the costs incurred to operate these cmcs are denominated in canadian dollars or philippine pesos  which represents a foreign currency exchange risk to us 
although 
table of contents we enter into forward financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates  we do not fully hedge this risk 
as the us dollar weakens  the operating expenses of these cmcs  once translated into us dollars  increase in comparison to prior years 
if the us dollar does not strengthen  our consolidated financial results may be adversely impacted 
while our hedging strategy effectively offset a portion of these price increases during  there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully hedge this foreign currency exchange risk or that the us dollar will strengthen 
our financial results may be adversely impacted by our database marketing and consulting segment 
our database marketing and consulting segment has historically experienced higher levels of profitability than it is currently achieving 
our consolidated financial results and consolidated financial position  including our ability to obtain financing  may be adversely impacted if we are unable to return that segment to previous profitability levels

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview we serve our clients through two primary businesses i customer management services  which provides outsourced customer support and marketing services for a variety of industries via call centers customer management centers  or cmcs throughout the world  and ii database marketing and consulting 
we separate our customer management services business into two segments consistent with our management of the business  which reflects the internal financial reporting structure and operating focus 
north american customer care consists of customer management services provided to us and canadian clients while international customer care consists of clients in all other countries 
database marketing and consulting provides outsourced database management  direct marketing and related customer acquisition and retention services for automobile dealerships and manufacturers 
segment accounting policies are the same as those used in the consolidated financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding our preparation of segment information 
customer management services the customer management services segment generates revenue based primarily on the amount of time our representatives devote to a client s program 
we primarily focus on large global corporations in the following industries  automotive  communications and media  financial services  government  logistics  retail  technology and travel 
revenue is recognized as services are provided 
the majority of our revenue is  and we anticipate that the majority of our future revenue will continue to be  from multi year contracts 
however  we do provide some programs on a short term basis and our operations outside of north america are characterized by shorter term contracts 
additionally  we typically experience client attrition of approximately to of our revenue each year 
our invoice terms with customers range from days to days  with longer terms in europe 
we compete primarily with the in house customer management operations of our current and potential clients 
we also compete with certain companies that provide customer management services on an outsourced basis 
in general  over the last several years  the global economy has negatively impacted on the customer care management market 
more specifically  sales cycles have lengthened  competition has increased  and contract values have been reduced 
we believe  however  that recently the sales cycles have begun shortening 
the short term focus of management is to increase revenue in this segment by selling new business to existing customers  continuing to focus sales efforts on large  complex  multi center opportunities  differentiating our products and services by developing and offering new solutions to clients  and exploring merger and acquisition possibilities 
our ability to enter into new multi year contracts  particularly large complex opportunities  is dependent upon the macroeconomic environment in general and the specific industry environments in which our customers operate 
a weakening of the us and or the global economy could lengthen sales cycles or cause delays in closing new business opportunities 
our profitability is significantly influenced by our ability to increase capacity utilization in our cmcs  to increase the number of new or expanded programs during a period and our success at managing personnel turnover and employee costs 
managing our costs is critical 
table of contents since we continue to see pricing pressure within our industry 
these pricing pressures have been made worse by the rapid growth of offshore labor 
we attempt to minimize the financial impact resulting from idle capacity when planning the development and opening of new cmcs or the expansion of existing cmcs 
as such  management considers numerous factors that affect capacity utilization  including anticipated expirations  reductions  terminations or expansions of existing programs  and the potential size and timing of new client contracts that we expect to obtain 
however  to respond more rapidly to changing market demands  to implement new programs and to expand existing programs  we may be required to commit to additional capacity prior to the contracting of additional business  which may result in idle capacity 
this is largely due to the significant time required to negotiate and execute a contract as we continue to concentrate our marketing efforts toward obtaining large  complex  customer management programs 
we internally target capacity utilization in our dedicated and multi client centers at to of our available workstations 
as of december   the overall capacity utilization in our multi client centers was and our dedicated centers was resulting in an overall utilization of see financial comparison for further details 
our profitability is also influenced by the number of new or expanded client programs 
as required by the adoption of eitf for contracts entered into after july   in the event that a client may be billed for direct start up costs  the associated revenue and costs are deferred and recognized straight line over the life of the contract 
in the event that a client cannot be billed for direct start up costs  then those start up costs are expensed as incurred 
we strive to enter contracts where our clients pay separately for start up costs as opposed to incorporating them into the ongoing production rate 
our industry is very labor intensive and the majority of our operating costs relate to wages  costs of employee benefits and employment taxes 
an improvement in the local or global economies where our cmcs are located could lead to increased labor related costs 
in addition  our industry experiences high personnel turnover  and the length of training required to implement new programs continues to increase due to increased complexities of our clients businesses 
this may create challenges if we obtain several significant new clients or implement several new  large scale programs  and need to recruit  hire and train qualified personnel at an accelerated rate 
our success in improving our profitability will depend on successful execution of a comprehensive business plan  including the following broad steps increasing sales to absorb unused capacity in existing global cmcs  reducing costs and continued focus on cost controls  and managing our workforce in domestic and international cmcs in a cost effective manner 
database marketing and consulting our database marketing and consulting segment has relationships with over  automobile dealers representing different brand names 
these contracts generally have terms ranging from twelve to twenty four months 
for a few major automotive manufacturers  the automotive manufacturer collects from the individual automobile dealers on our behalf 
our average collection period is days 
a majority of the revenue from this segment is generated utilizing a database and contact engine to promote the service business of automobile dealership customers using targeted marketing solutions through the web  e mail  phone or mail 
as previously discussed  due to a combination of factors  including a delay in retrofitting software for new client applications  an increase in sales and marketing expenses and a decline in the subscriber base  our income from operations declined for as compared to we believe this trend will continue into the first quarter of and we expect approximately breakeven results for the segment for that quarter 
we also expect this segment to operate profitably in subsequent quarters due to a recently announced program with ford and anticipated cost reductions 
we plan to focus on the following during increasing revenue by expanding our offerings  diversifying our customer base by establishing relations with dealer groups and non current customer automotive manufacturers  
table of contents continuing to drive cost reductions through a combination of reductions in force and operational effectiveness  and acquiring business platforms for similar and related services 
overall as shown in the financial comparison  we believe that we have been successful in improving income from operations 
the increase reflected is attributable to a variety of factors such as implementing our multi phased cost reduction plan  transitioning work on certain clients to lower cost operating centers  and taking actions to improve individual client profit margins and or eliminate unprofitable client programs 
we implemented a million cost reduction plan approximately months ago to address known changes in our business and  in particular  the decline in revenue and operating income due to the declining minimum commitments discussed further in client concentrations 
we believe this plan  among other factors  enabled us to operate profitably during these improvements were achieved primarily through cost savings in the areas of cmc operations  telecommunications  professional fees  insurance and reduced future interest expense associated with our debt restructuring plan 
as a result of these initiatives  our operational cash flow improved and that  coupled with tax planning strategies providing repatriation of cash from international subsidiaries to the us  has allowed us to repay nearly all of our outstanding debt 
as such  we expect lower interest expense in future periods  unless we were to incur additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions or to fund our stock repurchase program 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business and results of operations 
for further discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our reported results are impacted by the application of the following accounting policies  certain of which require management to make subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments involve making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact quarterly or annual results of operations 
specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as expected  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
descriptions of these critical accounting policies follow revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue at the time services are performed 
our customer management services business recognizes revenue under production rate and performance based models  which are production rate revenue is recognized based on the billable hours or minutes of each csr  as defined in the client contract 
the rate per billable hour or minute is based on a predetermined contractual rate 
this contractual rate can fluctuate based on our performance against certain pre determined criteria related to quality and performance 
performance based under performance based arrangements  we are paid by our customers based on achievement of certain levels of sales or other client determined criteria specified in the client contract 
we recognize performance based revenue by measuring our actual results against the performance criteria specified in the contracts 
amounts collected from customers prior to the performance of services are recorded as deferred revenue 
certain client programs provide for adjustments to monthly billings based upon whether we exceed certain performance criteria as set forth in the contract 
increases or decreases to monthly billings arising from such contract terms are reflected in revenue as incurred 
our database marketing and consulting segment recognizes revenue when services are rendered 
most agreements require the billing of predetermined monthly rates 
where the contractual billing periods do not coincide with the periods over which services are provided  the 
table of contents company recognizes revenue straight line over the life of the contract typically six to twenty four months 
we have certain contracts that are billed in advance 
accordingly  amounts billed and collected but not earned under these contracts are excluded from revenue and included in customer advances and deferred income 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of transactions that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
when circumstances warrant  we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be recovered from future projected taxable income 
sfas no 
provides for the weighing of positive and negative evidence in determining whether it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset is recoverable 
we prepare a forecast of future taxable income  including domestic and international operating results and the reversal of existing temporary differences between income recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap and income for federal income tax reporting purposes 
relevant accounting guidance suggests that a recent history of cumulative losses constitutes significant negative evidence  and that future expectations about taxable income are overshadowed by such recent losses 
accordingly  the expectations of future taxable income would generally be limited to no more than two or three years for generating sufficient income to recover deferred tax assets 
based upon assessments of recoverability of our deferred tax assets  our valuation allowance as of december  is million 
this valuation allowance is principally related to deferred tax assets associated with the local operations in the us  spain  brazil  argentina  korea and india 
we have approximately million of net deferred tax assets as of december  related principally to certain international countries whose recoverability is dependent upon future profitability 
the net deferred tax asset for us operations of approximately million as of december  relates entirely to deferred tax assets originating during and is recoverable from current taxable income 
goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually for reporting units one level below the segment level in accordance with sfas no 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
fair value can be determined based on discounted cash flows  comparable sales or valuations of other similar businesses 
our policy is to test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year unless an indicator of impairment arises during an intervening period 
the most significant assumptions used in this analysis are those made in estimating future cash flows 
in estimating future cash flows  we generally use the financial assumptions in our internal forecasting model such as projected capacity utilization  projected changes in the prices we charge for our services and projected labor costs 
we then use a discount rate we consider appropriate for the country where the business unit is providing services 
if actual results are less than the assumptions used in performing the impairment test  the fair value of the reporting units may be significantly lower  causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating an impairment had occurred 
based on the analyses performed in the fourth quarter of  there was no impairment to the december  goodwill balance of million 
if projected revenue used in the analysis of goodwill was less than forecast the projections assumed revenue growth rates ranging from to per annum over a three year period  there would still be no impairment to goodwill 
for the year ended december   one client represents of the revenue in the asia pacific region 
we anticipate renewal of this contract during if we are not successful in obtaining a renewal with satisfactory terms  we could incur an impairment of goodwill and  potentially  certain long lived assets 
the goodwill and potential net property and equipment  reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets for the asia pacific region is million and million  respectively  as of december  restructuring liability 
we routinely assess the profitability and utilization of our cmcs 
in some cases  we have chosen to close under performing centers and make reductions in force to enhance future profitability 
in and  under the previous accounting guidance  we recorded the anticipated charges at the time a plan was approved by management or the board of directors 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 which specifies that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred instead of upon commitment to a plan 

table of contents a significant assumption used in determining the amount of estimated liability for closing cmcs is the estimated liability for future lease payments on vacant centers  which we determine based on a third party broker s assessment of our ability to successfully negotiate early termination agreements with landlords and or our ability to sublease the premises 
if our assumptions regarding early termination and the timing and amounts of sublease payments prove to be inaccurate  we may be required to record additional losses  or conversely  a future gain  in our consolidated statements of operations 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of our individual cmcs in accordance with sfas no 
to determine whether future operating results are sufficient to recover the carrying costs of the long lived assets 
when the operating results of a center have reasonably progressed to a point making it likely that the site will continue to sustain losses in the future  or there is a current expectation that a cmc will be closed or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life  we select the center for further review 
for cmcs selected for further review  we estimate the probability weighted future cash flows from operating the center over its useful life 
significant judgment is involved in projecting future capacity utilization  pricing  labor costs and the estimated useful life of the center 
we do not subject cmcs that have been operated for less than two years or those centers that have been impaired within the past two years the two year rule to the same test because we believe sufficient time is necessary to establish market presence and build a customer base for such new or modified centers in order to adequately assess recoverability 
however  these centers are nonetheless evaluated in case other factors would indicate impairment had occurred 
for recently impaired centers  we write the assets down to estimated fair market value 
if the assumptions used in performing the impairment test prove insufficient  the fair value estimate of the cmcs may be significantly lower  thereby causing the carrying value to exceed fair value and indicating an impairment had occurred 
a sensitivity analysis of the impairment evaluation demonstrated that if revenue was less than projected in the probability weighted projection scenarios that had annual revenue growth rates ranging from to based on management expectations and available capacity and the margin held constant  the impairment loss would have been approximately million greater 
the following table summarizes the sensitivity analysis we performed during the fourth quarter of dollars in thousands impairment net under book number sensitivity value of cmcs test tested based on two year rule positive cash flow in period negative cash flow in period not tested based on two year rule positive cash flow in period negative cash flow in period total positive cash flow in period negative cash flow in period we also assess the realizable value of capitalized software on a quarterly basis  based upon current estimates of future cash flows from services based on the software  particularly with respect to our database marketing and consulting segment 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable 
each quarter management reviews the receivables on an account by account basis and assigns a probability of collection 
management judgment is used in assessing the probability of collection 
factors considered in making this judgment are the age of the identified receivable  client financial wherewithal  previous client history and any recent communications with the client 

table of contents presentation of non gaap measurements free cash flow 
free cash flow is a non gaap liquidity measurement 
we believe free cash flow is useful to our investors because it measures  during a given period  the amount of cash generated that is available for debt obligations and investments other than purchases of property and equipment 
free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and should not be considered a substitute for operating income  net income  net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with gaap 
we believe this non gaap liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable gaap measure of net cash flows from operating activities because free cash flow includes investments in operational assets 
free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for discretionary expenditures  since it includes cash required for debt service 
free cash flow also excludes cash  which may be necessary for acquisitions  investments and other needs that may arise 
the following table reconciles free cash flow to net cash flow from operating activities  the most directly comparable gaap measure for the years ended december  in thousands free cash flow add back purchases of property and equipment net cash flows from operating activities

versus revenue 
the increase in north american customer care revenue between periods was driven primarily by new client programs and increases in revenue in certain continuing client programs  partially offset by declining minimum commitments  a decline in revenue at percepta and the loss of client programs 
approximately of the increase in international customer care revenue between periods is due to changes in foreign currency 
table of contents exchange rates 
the remaining increase  related principally to latin america and europe  is due to new client programs and increases in revenue from an existing client  offset by discontinuation of unprofitable client programs to improve profitability 
database marketing and consulting revenue decreased primarily due to a decrease in the customer base as well as a decrease in billed revenue per client 
we believe this circumstance is attributable to our delay in completing certain software modifications to accommodate new programs 
costs of services 
costs of services as a percentage of revenue in north american customer care decreased mostly due to the successful implementation of our plan to reduce costs and increase client profitability 
in addition  as a result of a reduction in us based employee enrollment rates in the company s health plan we reduced certain self insurance accruals  which resulted in a change in estimate of million 
the decrease in costs of services as a percentage of revenue in international customer care between periods is a result of the termination of several unprofitable contracts  renegotiations of unfavorable contract terms and reductions in force 
this was offset by an increase in cost of services as a percentage of revenue in the asia pacific region  which was caused by increased costs related to entering new markets in the region and a new client launch 
in absolute dollars  of the increase in costs of services in international customer care is due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenue for north american customer care 
more than half of the increase related to increases in salaries and related expenses due to headcount additions in sales  marketing and product development personnel to implement our revenue growth strategy 
the remaining increase was due to the recording of employee incentive compensation accruals during the current year none were earned in the prior year  and consulting expense related to implementing the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue for international customer care 
this decrease is due to the increase in revenue between periods 
a significant amount of selling  general and administrative expenses are fixed in nature and  as a percentage of revenue  vary with changes in revenue volume 
in absolute dollars  the increase between periods was due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and an increase in the corporate allocation 
the corporate allocation increased mostly due to increases in headcount as discussed above 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in database marketing and consulting was caused primarily by the decrease in revenue as selling  general and administrative expenses are primarily fixed in nature  partially offset by a change in estimate for potential sales and use tax liabilities of million  which increased net income 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense excluding the impact of the change in the sales and use tax liability is due to increases in payroll related expenses due to headcount additions in sales  marketing and product development to implement our revenue growth strategy 
depreciation and amortization 
in absolute dollars  depreciation and amortization expense in north american customer care decreased slightly between the periods due to declines in depreciation and amortization expense due to assets reaching the scheduled end of their depreciable life offset by the depreciation and amortization expense of additions to property and technology equipment made during the year 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in international customer care was due to depreciation and amortization expense of additions to property and equipment in brazil as a result of new sites and changes in foreign currency exchange rates offset by a decline in depreciation and amortization expense due to assets reaching the scheduled end of their depreciable lives 
the slight increase in the database marketing and consulting depreciation and amortization expense was due to related depreciation and amortization expense additions of property and technology equipment combined with the commencement of amortizing certain capitalized software costs during restructuring charges 
during the year ended december   we recognized approximately million of termination benefits for approximately employees  across all three segments 
we also reversed approximately million of excess accruals related to and prior restructurings 
restructuring charges are accrued in accordance with sfas no

potential future impairments are discussed under critical accounting policies 
other income expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  includes approximately million interest expense estimated to be paid as a result of implementing our tax planning strategies and million related to our long term debt and grant advances 
the decrease in interest expense related to long term debt from the prior year is due to the prepayment of the senior notes discussed in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
included in debt restructuring charge for the year ended december  are million of one time charges related to restructuring of the debt  of which approximately million was a cash charge and the remaining million was a non cash charge to write off previously capitalized debt issuance costs 
additionally  we recorded a one time charge of million related to the termination of an interest rate swap 
income taxes 
when compared to  income tax expense in decreased million to million even though pre tax book income increased million 
this is primarily due to the fact that in we increased our valuation allowance by million and wrote off a million deferred tax asset related to the company s investment in ehi and did not incur any similar tax charges in the company s return to profitability in has led to an increase in income tax liabilities in most tax jurisdictions  which is only partially offset by tax planning strategies 
going forward  our effective tax rate will be affected by many factors including  i the amount and placement of new business into tax jurisdictions with valuation allowances and those without valuation allowances and ii the impact of any tax refunds that we might realize from various tax planning strategies and filing positions we are pursuing 
at this time  our estimate of the annual effective tax rate is approximately  exclusive of any future tax refunds  tax planning strategies and filing positions  or reductions of the u 
s 
deferred tax valuation allowance arising from future us taxable income

the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in north american customer care is primarily due to the decrease in revenue between periods as a significant amount of selling  general and administrative expenses are fixed in nature 
also in the first quarter of  we determined that the bonuses would not be paid in full and accordingly  reversed the bonus accrual of approximately million from selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for international customer care increased as a percentage of revenue

the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for database marketing and consulting is due to decreases in payroll related expenses

table of contents during  the international customer care segment recorded an impairment loss of approximately million to reduce the net book value of the long lived assets of our mexico city cmc to its estimated fair market value 
other income expenses the increase in other expenses between periods was primarily due to an increase in interest expense as well as foreign currency transaction losses partially offset by a decrease in the equity losses from our investment in ehi during interest expense increased as a result of higher long term debt balances in compared to due to borrowings related to the purchase of the corporate headquarters building in february in addition  the interest rates were increased in august as a result of amending our long term debt agreements due to violations of the debt covenants 
during  we recorded approximately million of foreign currency transaction losses versus the million gain in foreign currency transaction losses and gains are related to intercompany receivable payable balances  and while we hedge the foreign currency risks associated with our revenue in canada  we do not hedge risks associated with the timing of settling intercompany accounts 
we began settling these accounts more timely in the third quarter of  which mitigated our future exposure to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates 
income taxes 
income tax expense increased million in from million in primarily due to  i the increase in the valuation allowances of million principally in the us and brazil and ii the write off of million of deferred tax assets related to the company s investment in ehi following a statutory merger that resulted in the investment not being recoverable for tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity during was cash generated from operating activities 
we expect that our future working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements will be satisfied primarily from existing cash balances and cash generated from operations 
our ability to generate positive future operating and net cash flows is dependent upon  among other things  our ability to sell new business and manage our operating costs efficiently 
the amount of capital required in will also depend on our levels of investment in infrastructure necessary to maintain  upgrade or replace existing assets 
we currently expect that s capital expenditures will be approximately the same as our capital expenditures of million 
our capital expenditures will also vary depending on development or retrofit of new or existing cmcs 
our working capital and capital expenditure requirements could increase materially in the event of acquisitions or joint ventures  among other factors 
these factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future 
the following discussion highlights our free cash flow and cash flow activities during the years ended december   and cash and cash equivalents 
we consider all liquid investments purchased within days of their maturity to be cash equivalents 
our cash and cash equivalents totaled million as of december   compared to million as of december  free cash flow 
free cash flow was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively see presentation of non gaap measurements 
the increase from to of approximately million resulted from an increase in net cash flows from operating activities of approximately million and a decrease in purchases of property and equipment of approximately million 
the increase in net cash flows from operating activities is primarily attributable to a benefit in deferred income taxes and the company operating profitably for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the decrease in purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to the including the purchase of the company s headquarters building 
the decrease from to of approximately million resulted primarily from a decrease in net cash flows from operating activities of approximately million and an increase in purchases of property and equipment of approximately million 
the decrease in net cash flows from operating activities is primarily attributable to an increase in net loss and a decrease in cash flow generated from changes in operating assets and liabilities in as compared to cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was million during compared to million during 
table of contents cash flows from operating activities 
we reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business or purchases of treasury stock 
for the years ended december   and  we reported net cash flows provided by operating activities of million  million and million  respectively 
see discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in the discussion of free cash flow above 
cash flows from investing activities 
we reinvest cash in our business primarily to grow our client base and to expand our infrastructure 
for the years ended december   and  we reported net cash flows used in investing activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease from to of approximately million primarily resulted from lower purchases of property and equipment 
the deterioration from to of approximately million resulted from increased purchases of property and equipment during the increase also resulted from payments to minority shareholder  capitalized software costs and a strategic business acquisition 
cash flows from financing activities 
for the years ended december   and  we reported net cash flows provided by used in financing activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease from to of approximately million principally resulted from the repayment of our long term debt and credit facility 
the increase from to of approximately million principally resulted from proceeds from borrowings against our line of credit coupled with a decrease in the repurchase of common stock 
obligations and future capital requirements future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations are summarized as follows less than over contractual obligations year years years years total long term debt capital lease obligations grant advances purchase obligations operating lease commitments total reflected on consolidated balance sheets not reflected on consolidated balance sheets purchase obligations 
effective december  we entered into a thirty month initial period contract with a telecommunications company with a minimum purchase commitment of million 
if we terminate the contract during the initial period  a penalty of up to of the minimum purchase commitment will be assessed 
if  during the initial period  the telecommunications company terminates or significantly reduces volumes under a master service agreement signed with us on june   a penalty of of the remaining minimum purchase commitment can be assessed to the client 
from time to time we contract with certain of our communications clients which represent approximately one third of our annual revenue to provide us with telecommunication services 
we believe these contracts are negotiated on an arms length basis and may be negotiated at different times and with different legal entities 
future capital requirements 
our cash requirements include capital expenditures primarily related to ongoing maintenance  upgrades or replacement of existing assets  the development and retrofit of new and or existing cmcs  possible acquisitions of companies  formations of joint ventures and repurchases of common stock 
we expect total capital expenditures in to be approximately million 
approximately a third of which is attributable to maintenance capital for existing cmcs  the opening and or expansion of cmcs and internal technology projects 
such expenditures are financed with operating cash flows  existing cash balances and  to the extent necessary  cash flows from financing activities 
the anticipated level of capital expenditures is primarily dependent upon new client contracts and the corresponding requirement for additional cmc capacity and technological infrastructure 

table of contents we may initiate restructurings  dispositions  mergers  acquisitions and other similar transactions 
such transactions could include the transfer  sale or acquisition of significant assets  businesses or interests  including joint ventures  or the incurrence  assumption or refinancing of indebtedness  and could be material to the consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations of the company 
the launch of large client contracts may result in negative working capital because of the time period between incurring the costs for training and launching the program  and the beginning of the accounts receivable collection process 
as a result  periodically we may generate negative cash flows from operating activities 
debt instruments and related covenants during april  we began to execute a plan  approved by the board of directors  to reduce long term debt and the associated interest costs and improve financial flexibility by re aligning our capital structure to better support our business plans 
our strategy was to accomplish two objectives  i to refinance the then existing revolving line of credit revolver with a new revolving credit facility credit facility  thereby providing greater financial and operational flexibility and ii to de leverage the consolidated balance sheet by prepaying the high cost senior notes 
on may   we achieved the first objective by structuring a new  secured credit facility 
under this credit facility  we may borrow up to million with an option to increase the size of the credit facility to a maximum of million subject to approval by the lender at any time up to days prior to maturity of the credit facility 
on june   we achieved the second objective by prepaying the million in outstanding obligations under the senior notes as part of the early debt retirement we were required to pay million under the make whole provision 
we also recorded a million non cash charge for deferred costs related to the former revolver and senior notes 
during  we terminated our interest rate swap associated with the revolver the termination was in conjunction with the repayment of the revolver balance in full  resulting in a million pre tax cash charge 
the cash charge related to the interest rate swap  the make whole provision of the long term debt retirement and the non cash charge were recorded as debt restructuring charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we estimate that it will result in future pre tax net interest expense savings of million through december client concentrations our five largest clients accounted for  and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  these five clients accounted for an even greater proportional share of our consolidated earnings 
the profitability of services provided to these clients varies greatly based upon the specific contract terms with any particular client 
the relative contribution of any single client to consolidated earnings is not always proportional to the relative revenue contribution on a consolidated basis 
the risk of this concentration is mitigated  in part  by the long term contracts we have with our largest clients 
the contracts with these clients expire between and additionally  a particular client can have multiple contracts with different expiration dates 
we have historically renewed most of our contracts with our largest customers 
however  there is no assurance that future contracts will be renewed  or if renewed  will be on terms as favorable as the existing contracts 
under the terms of the original contract with verizon communications verizon relating to its competitive local exchange carrier clec business  there were certain minimum monthly volume commitments at pre determined hourly billing rates minimum commitments 
as previously reported  when the clec work was redirected to other verizon business units during  verizon continued to honor the contractual terms of its minimum commitments 
while the terms negotiated by these business units were generally at lower hourly billing rates base rates than the minimum commitments  verizon has continued to meet its financial obligations associated with the minimum commitments 
in certain instances  the base rates exceed current market rates for similar services and upon contract expiration 
if the contracts are renewed  we expect the rates we receive for our services in the future to be less than the base rates 
in other instances  volume associated with new work was also offset against the minimum commitments 
in addition  certain remaining minimum commitments were bought out with cash and these settlement payments were amortized over the life of such minimum commitments 
the minimum commitments had been satisfied by december  the amount of minimum commitments satisfied by verizon in excess of the base rates  together with amortized settlement payments  
table of contents were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts impacted pre tax earnings by a like amount and  accordingly  the decline had an adverse effect on our operating results in recent accounting pronouncements we discuss the potential impact of recent accounting pronouncements in note to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the consolidated financial position  consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in us interest rates  london inter bank offer rate libor and foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
as of december   we had entered into forward financial instruments with several financial institutions to manage and reduce the impact of changes principally in the us canadian dollar exchange rates 
interest rate risk the interest on the revolver is variable based upon libor and  therefore  is affected by changes in market interest rates 
at december   there was no outstanding balance on the revolver 
if libor increased  there would be no impact to the company 
foreign currency risk we have certain wholly owned subsidiaries in argentina  australia  brazil  china  india  korea  malaysia  mexico  new zealand  northern ireland  singapore  and spain 
revenue and expenses from these operations are denominated in local currency  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
the changes in the exchange rate may positively or negatively affect our revenue and net income attributed to these subsidiaries 
for the years ended december   and  revenue from non us countries represented  and of consolidated revenue  respectively 
we have contracted with several commercial banks to acquire a total of million canadian dollars through december at a fixed price in us dollars of million via forwards  participating forwards and option contracts 
we have derivative assets of million associated with foreign exchange contracts  of which approximately million relates to canadian dollar hedge contracts that will settle in if the us canadian dollar exchange rate were to increase or decrease from the levels at december   we could incur a material gain or loss in on the contracts  which is estimated to range from a gain of million to a loss of million 
however  any gain or loss would be mitigated by corresponding losses or gains in the underlying exposures 
a business strategy for our north american customer care segment is to serve certain us based customers from canadian cmcs in order to leverage the us canadian dollar exchange rates 
during the year ended december   the canadian dollar has strengthened against the us dollar by in addition to a strengthening during as a result  our costs remain constant in canadian dollars  whereas our revenue which is denominated in us dollars is decreasing for the unhedged portion 
while our hedging strategy can protect us from changes in the us canadian dollar exchange rates in the short term for the majority of its risk  an overall strengthening of the canadian dollar may adversely impact margins in the north american customer care segment over the long term 
other than the transactions hedged as discussed above  the majority of the transactions of our us and foreign operations are denominated in the respective local currency while some transactions are denominated in other currencies 
for example  the intercompany transactions that are expected to be settled are denominated in the local currency of the billing company 
since the accounting records of our foreign operations are kept in the respective local currency  any transactions denominated in other currencies are accounted for in the respective local currency at the time of the transaction 
upon settlement of such a transaction  any foreign currency gain or loss results in an adjustment to income 
we do not currently engage in hedging activities related to these types of foreign currency risks because we believe them to be insignificant as we settle these accounts on a timely basis 
fair value of debt and equity securities we did not have any investments in debt or equity securities at december
