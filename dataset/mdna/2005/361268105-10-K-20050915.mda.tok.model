item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto which are included herein 
we utilize a week fiscal year ending on the saturday nearest june the fiscal year ended july  was a week year with the extra week reported in the fourth quarter 
overview g k services  inc  founded in and headquartered in minnetonka  minnesota  is a market leader in providing branded identity apparel and facility services programs that enhance image and safety in the workplace 
we serve a wide variety of north american industrial  service and high technology companies providing them with rented uniforms and facility services products such as floor mats  dust mops  wiping towels  restroom supplies and selected linen items 
we also sell uniforms and other apparel items to customers in our direct sale programs 
the north american rental market is approximately billion  while the portion of the direct sale market targeted by us is approximately billion in size 
in fiscal  revenue grew to million  up over the prior year 
excluding the impact of the rd week in fiscal  full year revenues were up 
revenue growth continued to be negatively impacted by lost uniform wearers due to reduced employment levels within our existing customer base  largely offset by an improved pricing environment and new account sales 
our primary focus in fiscal was to improve top line growth while delivering year over year earnings improvement 
fiscal net income grew by to million 
this improvement in earnings was the result of operational initiatives including a focus on lower merchandise costs 
these improvements were partially offset by higher energy and production costs 
our industry is consolidating from many family owned and small local providers to several large providers 
we are participating in this industry consolidation 
our goal is to build a national footprint and  accordingly  place strategic value on acquisitions which expand our geographic presence 
we made several small acquisitions during fiscal in august  we acquired keefer laundry ltd  a textile laundry company serving the vancouver and whistler areas of british columbia 
the acquisition extends our uniform and textile rental service area to western canada 
nettoyeur shefford inc  a uniform and textile service company serving granby and montreal  quebec was purchased in october this acquisition enhances our market position serving customers in the province of quebec 
also in october  we purchased certain industrial rental assets and customers of marathon linen  inc  a uniform and textile service company serving the detroit metro area 
this acquisition expands our geographic coverage to a major north american market 
in december  we acquired the direct sale uniform group and related assets from lion apparel  inc  a dayton  ohio based designer  marketer and distributor of customized uniform programs 
this acquisition expands our direct sale business and positions us to pursue greater direct sale growth 
custom linen systems  ltd 
was acquired in february custom linen systems is a textile laundry company serving calgary and edmonton  alberta 
this acquisition expands our uniform and textile rental service presence in western canada 
in march  we acquired certain assets from coyne textile services 
we acquired two processing facilities serving customers in connecticut  new york  pennsylvania and new jersey  and also acquired certain customer assets in maryland and florida 
this purchase expands and enhances our uniform and textile rental business in north america 
the pro forma effect of the acquisitions listed above and those made in the last two fiscal years  had they been acquired at the beginning of each fiscal year  were not material  either individually or in the aggregate 
the total purchase consideration  including related acquisition costs of these transactions  was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal purchase consideration includes million of debt issued 
the total purchase price exceeded the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed by million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal critical accounting policies the discussion of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and 
table of contents disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts our rental operations business is largely based on written service agreements whereby we agree to collect  launder and deliver uniforms and other related products 
the service agreements provide for weekly billing upon completion of the laundering process and delivery to the customer 
accordingly  we recognize revenue from rental operations in the period in which the services are provided 
revenue from rental operations also includes billings to customers for lost or abused merchandise 
direct sale revenue is recognized in the period in which the product is shipped 
estimates are used in determining the collectibility of billed accounts receivable 
management analyzes specific accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and the age of outstanding balances when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
significant management judgments and estimates are used in connection with establishing the allowance in any accounting period 
while we have been consistent in applying our judgments and in making our estimates over the past three fiscal years  material differences may result in the amount and timing of bad debt expense recognition for any given period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
inventories our inventories consist of new goods and rental merchandise in service 
estimates are used in determining the likelihood that new goods on hand can be sold to customers or used in rental operations 
historical inventory usage and current revenue trends are considered in estimating both obsolete and excess inventories 
new goods are stated at lower of cost or market  net of any reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
merchandise placed in service to support rental operations is amortized into cost of rental operations over the estimated useful lives of the underlying inventory items  primarily on a straight line basis  which results in a matching of the cost of the merchandise with the weekly rental revenue generated by merchandise 
estimated lives of rental merchandise in service range from nine months to three years 
in establishing estimated lives for merchandise in service  management considers historical experience and the intended use of the merchandise 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of operating profit for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets as required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill is separately disclosed from other intangible assets on the balance sheet and no longer amortized 
sfas also requires that companies test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned below its carrying amount 
our evaluation follows the two step impairment test prescribed by sfas first we assess whether the fair value of the reporting units exceeds the carrying amount of the unit including goodwill 
our evaluation considers changes in the operating environment  competitive position  market trends  operating performance  quoted market prices for our equity securities and fair value models and research prepared by independent analysts 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value  we would perform a second test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
management completes its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
there have been no impairments of goodwill in fiscal  or future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and other intangibles associated with acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets are depreciated or amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management estimates of the period that the assets will add value 
long lived assets and definite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired 
there have been no write downs of any long lived assets or definite lived intangible assets in fiscal  or 
table of contents insurance we self insure for certain obligations related to health  workers compensation and auto and general liability programs 
we purchase stop loss insurance policies to protect us from catastrophic losses 
estimates are used in determining the potential liability associated with reported claims and for losses that have occurred  but have not been reported 
management estimates consider historical claims experience  escalating medical cost trends  expected timing of claim payments and an actuarial analysis provided by a third party 
changes in the cost of medical care  our ability to settle claims and the estimates and judgments used by management could have a material impact on the amount and timing of expense for any period 
income taxes in the normal course of business  we are subject to audits from federal  state  canadian provincial and other tax authorities regarding various tax liabilities 
these audits may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions  or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amount accrued 
we believe that taxes accrued on our consolidated balance sheets fairly represent the amount of future tax liability due 
we utilize income tax planning to reduce our overall cost of income taxes 
upon audit  it is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed resulting in an increased liability for income taxes 
we believe that the provision for liabilities resulting from the implementation of income tax planning is appropriate 
to date  we have not experienced an examination by governmental revenue authorities that would lead management to believe that our past provisions for exposures related to income tax planning are not appropriate 
deferred income taxes are determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements  using statutory rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion of the asset may not be realized 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets and liabilities on a periodic basis 
we believe that we have adequately provided for our future tax consequences based upon current facts  circumstances and tax law 

table of contents results of operations the percentage relationships to revenues of certain income and expense items for the three fiscal years ended july   july  and june   and the percentage changes in these income and expense items between years are presented in the following table percentage of revenues percentage change years ended between years fy vs

we operate on a fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to june as a result  periodically we will have a fiscal year with weeks of results 
fiscal was a week year 
we estimate that the extra week of operation generated incremental earnings of approximately per share in fiscal revenues 
total revenues in fiscal rose to million from million in fiscal excluding the extra week  revenues were up over fiscal rental revenue was up million in fiscal  a increase over fiscal rental revenue increased when excluding the impact of the extra week recorded in fiscal the organic industrial rental growth rate was approximately  an improvement from negative in the same period of fiscal improvements in customer retention and a better pricing environment continues to be negatively impacted by lost uniform wearers due to reduced employment levels within our existing customer base 
direct sale revenue was million in fiscal  a increase over million in fiscal  largely due to the impact of the lion uniform group 
the organic direct sale growth rate was approximately 
the increase in the organic direct sale growth rate was largely due to garment sales through our rental operation including our annual outerwear promotion and large shipments at our direct sale unit to one customer 
organic growth rates are calculated using industrial rental and direct sale revenue  respectively  adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate differences  revenue from newly acquired business and the impact of the extra week recorded in the prior year 
we believe that the organic growth rates better reflect the growth of our existing industrial rental and direct sale business and are therefore useful in analyzing our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents cost of rental and direct sale 
cost of rental operations increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross margin from rental sales decreased to in fiscal from in the prior year 
the decrease in gross margins was due to the positive fixed cost leverage from an extra week of revenue in the prior year  as well as higher energy and acquisition integration costs in the current year 
these were largely offset by the benefit of numerous operational initiatives focused on lower merchandise and production costs 
cost of direct sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross margin from direct sales increased in fiscal to from in fiscal the increase in gross margin was largely due to improved cost leverage resulting from greater sales volume 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  selling and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the improvement as a percent of revenue was due to a prior year charge of approximately million for a legal settlement and leverage on incremental revenue growth  partially offset by continued investment in growth initiatives

amortization expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  amortization expense increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to lower average debt levels associated with strong operating cash flow and slightly lower interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate for fiscal decreased to from in fiscal largely due to decreases in canadian statutory income tax rates 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
total revenues in fiscal rose to million from million in fiscal excluding the extra week  revenues were up over fiscal rental revenue was up million in fiscal  a increase over fiscal rental revenue increased when excluding the impact of the extra week recorded in fiscal the organic industrial rental growth rate was approximately negative 
organic industrial rental revenue continues to be negatively impacted by lost uniform wearers due to reduced employment levels within our existing customer base 
direct sale revenue was million in fiscal  a increase over million in fiscal the increase in direct sale revenue was driven by a focused effort to provide direct sale garments to our existing rental customers 
cost of rental and direct sale 
cost of rental operations increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross margin from rental sales decreased to in fiscal from in the prior year 
the decrease in rental gross margins was due to employee benefit costs including pension  higher energy costs and lost margin from lower employment levels within our existing customer base 
cost of direct sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross margin from direct sales decreased in fiscal to from in fiscal the decrease in gross margin was due primarily to product mix and merchandise cost increases 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  selling and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease as a percent of revenue was due to reduced expenses related to uncollectible accounts receivable and reduced selling expenses  which were partially offset by increased employee benefit costs 
also offsetting this improvement was the tentative settlement of a wage and hour dispute in california  which represented one time costs of million in fiscal depreciation 
depreciation expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  depreciation expense remained constant at in both fiscal and fiscal capital 
table of contents expenditures for fiscal  excluding acquisition of businesses  were million compared to million in fiscal as we continued to prudently manage our strategic investments 
amortization 
amortization expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  amortization expense increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to lower debt levels associated with significant levels of cash flow 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate for fiscal decreased to from in fiscal largely due to decreases in canadian statutory income tax rates 
liquidity  capital resources and financial condition our primary sources of cash are net cash flows from operations and borrowings under our debt arrangements 
primary uses of cash are interest payments on indebtedness  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  cash provided by operations was negatively impacted by the timing of payments of taxes as well as growth in new inventories in connection with the expansion of our manufacturing operation 
these uses of cash were partially offset by continued emphasis to control in service inventory expenditures 
fiscal cash provided by operations was positively impacted by one time improvements related to a focus on timely collection of accounts receivable as well as several initiatives focused on controlling the usage of in service inventory 
working capital at july  was million  a million increase from million at july  this increase was due to increases in accounts receivable and inventory levels associated with acquisitions and expansion of our off shore manufacturing 
investing activities 
net cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  and cash was largely used for acquisitions and property  plant and equipment additions 
financing activities 
financing activities provided cash of million in fiscal  used cash of million in fiscal and provided cash of million in fiscal cash provided in both fiscal and was from debt proceeds used primarily for acquisitions of businesses 
cash used in fiscal was primarily related to the repayment of long term debt 
we paid dividends of million in each of fiscal  and we maintain a million unsecured term loan and revolving credit facility expiring july  the facility provides for a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
as of july   borrowings outstanding under the term loan and revolving credit facility were million and million  respectively  at rates ranging from to 
borrowings under this facility are unsecured 
the unused portion of the revolver may be used for general corporate purposes  acquisitions  working capital needs and to provide up to million in letters of credit 
as of july   letters of credit outstanding against the revolving credit facility were million 
we have million  unsecured private placement notes with certain institutional investors 
the year notes have a seven year average life with a final maturity on july  beginning on july   and annually thereafter to maturity  we will repay million of the principal amount at par 
as of july   there was million outstanding under the notes 
on november   we entered into a loan agreement expiring on october  under the loan agreement  the lender will make loans to us on a revolving basis up to million 
we will be required to pay interest on outstanding loan balances at a rate per annum of one month london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin or  if the lender is funding the loan through the issuance of commercial paper to third parties  at a rate per annum equal to a margin plus the average annual interest rate for such commercial paper 
in connection with the loan agreement  we granted a first priority security interest in certain of our us based receivables 
the amount of funds available under the loan agreement will be based on the amount of eligible receivables less various reserve requirements 
we used the net proceeds of this loan to reduce indebtedness under our unsecured credit facilities 
at july   there was million outstanding under the agreement 

table of contents on june   we issued million of floating rate unsecured private placement notes 
the notes are priced at over libor 
the million floating rate notes are scheduled to mature on june  the notes do not require principal payments until maturity 
interest payments are reset and paid on a quarterly basis 
as of july   the outstanding balance of the notes was million at a current rate of 
the credit facilities  loan agreements  fixed rate notes and variable rate notes contain various restrictive covenants that among other matters require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum stockholders equity and a maximum leverage ratio  all as defined 
these debt arrangements also contain customary representations  warranties  covenants and indemnifications 
at july   we were in compliance with all debt covenants and only a material adverse change in our financial performance and condition could result in a potential event of default 
in the unlikely event that an event of default would be imminent  management believes that we would be able to successfully negotiate amended covenants or obtain waivers  however  certain financial concessions might be required 
our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if amended covenants or waivers in acceptable terms could not be successfully negotiated 
cash obligations 
under various agreements  we are obligated to make future cash payments in fixed amounts 
these include payments under the variable rate term loan and revolving credit facility  the fixed rate term loan  capital lease obligations and rent payments required under non cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year 
the following table summarizes our fixed cash obligations as of july  for the next five fiscal years and thereafter in thousands and there after total variable rate term loan and revolving credit facility variable rate notes variable rate loan fixed rate notes other debt arrangements  including capital leases operating leases total contractual cash obligations also  at july   we had stand by letters of credit totaling million issued and outstanding  primarily in connection with our property and casualty insurance programs 
no amounts have been drawn upon these letters of credit 
at july   we had available cash on hand of million and approximately million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility 
we anticipate that we will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to satisfy our cash commitments and capital requirements for fiscal and to reduce the amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility  however  we may utilize borrowings under the revolving credit facility to supplement our cash requirements from time to time 
we estimate that capital expenditures in fiscal will be approximately million to million 
the amount of cash flow generated from operations is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
in fiscal  we may actively seek and consider acquisitions of business assets  the consummation of any acquisition could affect our liquidity profile and level of outstanding debt 
we believe that our earnings and cash flow from operations  existing credit facilities and our ability to obtain additional debt or equity capital  if necessary  will be adequate to finance acquisition opportunities 
pension obligations we account for our defined benefit pension plan using sfas no 
employer s accounting for pensions sfas 
under sfas  pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods 
pension expense calculated under sfas is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements 
we recognized expense for our defined benefit pension plan of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
at july   the fair value of our pension plan assets totaled million 
we anticipate making a cash contribution of approximately million in fiscal 
table of contents the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of critical assumptions  including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions 
pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases 
at july   we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a long term rate of return of 
this rate is consistent with the assumed rate used at both july  and june  and was developed by evaluating input from our actuary as well as long term inflation assumptions 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets at july  is based on an allocation of us equities and us fixed income securities 
decreasing the expected long term rate of return by from to would increase our estimated pension expense by approximately million 
pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is reduced 
we discounted future pension obligations using a rate of at july   at july  and at june  the discount rate is determined based on the current rates earned on high quality long term bonds 
decreasing the discount rate by from to would increase our accumulated benefit obligation at july  by approximately million and increase the estimated fiscal pension expense by approximately million 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 
impact of inflation in general  management believes that our results of operations are not dependent on moderate changes in the inflation rate 
historically  we have been able to manage the impacts of more significant changes in inflation rates through our customer relationships  customer agreements that generally provide for price increases consistent with the rate of inflation or  whichever is greater  and continued focus on improvements of operational productivity 
significant increases in energy costs  specifically natural gas and gasoline  can materially affect our results of operations and financial condition 
currently  energy costs represent approximately of our total revenue 
litigation we are involved in a variety of legal actions relating to personal injury  employment  environmental and other legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
these legal actions include lawsuits that challenge the practice of charging for certain environmental services on invoices  and being named  along with other defendants  as a potentially responsible party at certain waste disposal sites where ground water contamination has been detected or is suspected  however  there has been no activity or further notifications in connection with these waste disposal sites for a period of years 
none of these legal actions are expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in statement for determining the fair value of a share based payment 
however  sfas r requires the fair value of all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the new standard will be effective for public entities excluding small business issuers in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  we plan to adopt this statement in the first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of the act provides companies with a safe harbor when making forward looking statements as a way of encouraging them to furnish their shareholders with information regarding expected trends in their operating results  anticipated business developments and other prospective information 
statements made in this report concerning our intentions  expectations or predictions about future results or events are forward looking statements within the meaning of the act 
these statements reflect our current expectations or beliefs  and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to vary from stated expectations  which could be material and adverse 
given that circumstances may change  and new risks to the business may emerge from time to time  having the potential to 
table of contents negatively impact our business in ways we could not anticipate at the time of making a forward looking statement  you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these statements  and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
some of the factors that could cause actual results or events to vary from stated expectations include  but are not limited to  the following unforeseen operating risks  the effects of overall economic conditions and employment levels  fluctuations in costs of insurance and energy  acquisition integration costs  the performance of acquired businesses  preservation of positive labor relationships  competition  including pricing  within the branded identity apparel and facility services industry  unplanned litigation or regulatory proceedings  and the availability of capital to finance planned growth 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates 
we use financial instruments  including fixed and variable rate debt  as well as interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk 
interest rate swap agreements are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures 
assuming the current level of borrowings  a one percentage point increase in interest rates under these borrowings would have increased our interest expense for fiscal by approximately million 
this estimated exposure considers the mitigating effects of interest rate swap agreements outstanding at july  on the change in the cost of variable rate debt 
the following table provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the fair values were estimated by discounting the projected cash flows using the current rate applicable to similar transactions 
for debt obligations  the following table presents principal cash flow and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates by fiscal year 
fixed rate variable rate maturity date amount rate amount rate thereafter total fair value for interest rate swaps  the following table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates by fiscal year 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
notional principal average interest average interest maturity date amount pay rate receive rate total fair value 
table of contents energy cost risk we use derivative financial instruments to manage the risk that changes in gasoline cost will affect the future financial results of the company 
we purchase gasoline futures contracts to effectively hedge a portion of anticipated actual gasoline purchases 
the gasoline futures contracts are reflected at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet and the related gains or losses on these contracts are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income or in the statements of operations depending on the effectiveness of the hedge 
upon settlement of each contract  the actual gain or loss is reflected in gasoline expense 
the current fair market value of all outstanding contracts at july  is million 
foreign currency exchange risk we have a significant foreign subsidiary located in canada 
the assets and liabilities of this subsidiary are denominated in the canadian dollar and as such are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date 
results of operations are translated using the average exchange rates throughout the period 
the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on translation of assets and liabilities are recorded as a component of stockholders equity 
gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in results of operations 
we may periodically hedge firm commitments with our foreign subsidiary  generally with foreign currency contracts 
these agreements are recorded at current market values and the gains and losses are included in earnings 
gains and losses on such transactions were not significant in fiscal notional amounts outstanding under foreign currency contracts at july  were million  all of which will mature during fiscal notional amounts outstanding under foreign currency contracts at july  were million  all of which matured during fiscal notional amounts outstanding under foreign currency contracts at june  were million  all of which matured during fiscal foreign currency contracts were recorded at fair value as of july
