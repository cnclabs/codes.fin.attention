sales rayonier s sales for the three years ended december   were as follows in millions year ended december  timber and real estate timber real estate total timber and real estate performance fibers cellulose specialties absorbent materials total performance fibers wood products lumber mdf total wood products other intersegment eliminations total sales rayonier has customers in more than countries and approximately percent of the company s sales of billion were made to customers outside the united states 
timber and real estate rayonier buys and manages timberlands  sells standing timber at auction to third parties  sells delivered logs  and also sells land for real estate development and large tract conservation 
the segment executes its strategies in two ways through both timber and real estate sales 
timber rayonier owned or leased approximately million acres of timberlands as of december   as follows in thousands of acres region total acres fee owned acres long term leased acres southeast us northwest us new zealand total excluded are approximately  acres managed by rayonier in australia   acres managed in new zealand and  acres of non harvestable or native vegetation land in new zealand 
the company s southeastern us timberlands consist of approximately million acres located primarily in georgia  florida and alabama 
these timberlands proximity to pulp  paper and lumber mills results in significant competition for the purchase of the timber 
approximately percent of timber harvest represents high value wood sold primarily to lumber mills 
the balance is pulpwood used for making pulp and paper 
softwoods are the predominant species on the southeastern us timberlands and include loblolly and slash pine  while hardwoods include red oak  sweet gum  black gum  red maple  cypress and green ash 
northwestern us timberlands consist of approximately  acres primarily on the olympic peninsula in western washington state 
all are owned in fee and consist primarily of softwood second growth trees with approximately percent hemlock and the remainder douglas fir  western red cedar and spruce 
hardwood timber stands consist principally of alder and maple 
the company s new zealand forest assets consist of approximately  acres of fee owned timberland  plus crown forest licenses that provide the right to grow and harvest timber on approximately  acres of government owned timberland for a minimum period of years 
approximately percent of these timberlands consist of radiata pine  well suited for high quality lumber and panel products 
the balance is douglas fir and other species 
timber is grown and sold for both domestic new zealand uses and for export  primarily to the pacific rim markets 
in addition  the company manages timberlands for other parties in new zealand and australia 
rayonier manages timberlands to scientifically develop forests to their maximum economic value 
the average rotation age for timber from the southeastern us primarily southern pine is years 
the average rotation age for timber from the northwestern us primarily hemlock and douglas fir is years with a target age of years 
the average rotation age for timber grown in new zealand primarily radiata pine is years 
timber in the southeast us is saw timber and pulpwood  while timber in the northwest us and new zealand is primarily saw timber 
rayonier sells timber through a public auction process  predominantly to third parties  and to some extent  also sells delivered logs 
by requiring the company s other operating units to competitively bid for their timber and wood requirements  the company believes it can maximize the true economic return on its investments 
in  approximately percent of timber sales were made to third parties 
sales in the southeast us and northwest us are primarily made on a pay as cut basis  which qualify for capital gains treatment under section b of the internal revenue code irc 
these contracts generally require a minimum percent initial payment and title and risk of loss are transferred when the timber is cut 
in new zealand  pay as cut contracts are also utilized which require a cash deposit or performance bond 
payments are made and title and risk of loss are transferred as the timber is cut 
in a few cases  in new zealand  lump sum contracts are utilized which require a percent initial deposit 
title and risk of loss are transferred at the time of deposit and advance installment payments are required in order for the contracted volume of timber to be cut 
the company manages its timberlands in conformity with best forest industry practices 
a key to success is the application of rayonier s extensive silvicultural expertise to species selection for plantations  soil preparation  thinning of timber stands  pruning of selected species  fertilization and careful timing of the harvest  all of which are designed to maximize value while complying with environmental requirements 
through such practices  the company has increased volume per acre of managed timber available for harvest from its southeastern us timberlands by approximately percent per year 
this is a primary factor behind an increasing pine harvest trend over the past years 
the following table sets forth timberland acres in thousands as of december   by region and by timber classification region softwood plantations hardwood lands non forest total southeast us northwest us new zealand total includes only fee and leased timberlands and excludes management only agreements in new zealand and australia 
softwood merchantable timber inventory is an estimate of timber volume based on the earliest economically harvestable age 
hardwood inventory is an estimate of timber volume available for harvest 
estimates are based on an inventory system that continually involves periodic statistical sampling 
adjustments are made on the basis of growth estimates  harvest information and market conditions which may impact the economical harvesting of timber located in wetlands  or other marginal geographic areas 
the following table sets forth the estimated volumes of merchantable timber by location and type  as of december  region softwood hardwood total equivalent total  in thousands of short green tons southeast us  in thousands of short green tons northwest us  in millions of board feet new zealand  in thousands of metric tons excludes approximately million tons of seed trees  trees located in swamplands and restricted areas and million tons of harvestable timber located on hbu properties 
excludes approximately million board feet of timber  or million tons  located in environmentally sensitive areas 
real estate the company invests in timberlands seeking to maximize its total return from a full cycle of ownership  which includes selling portions of its timberland base to capture the appreciated value of its asset base 
this program also includes selling timberland for conservation purposes or for others to manage and harvest  as well as selling hbu real estate 
in november  rayonier announced that it would sell percent to percent of its timberland base each year to routinely capture the appreciated value 
as part of the company s plan to periodically replenish its timberland base primarily through large scale  strategic acquisitions  the company purchased  acres of timberlands in southern alabama the andalusia property in and structured the transaction as a like kind exchange as outlined in internal revenue code irc section see note like kind exchanges real estate  for additional information on this transaction 
real estate sales for the three years ended december   are summarized in the following table thousands of dollars  except acres sold real estate sales operating income acres sold includes  acres of timber lease rights associated with a northeast florida sale million performance fibers rayonier is a leading manufacturer of high performance cellulose fibers with production facilities in jesup  ga and fernandina beach  fl having a combined annual capacity of approximately  metric tons 
to meet customers needs these facilities are capable of manufacturing more than different grades of performance fibers 
the jesup facility can produce approximately  metric tons  or percent of rayonier s total capacity and the fernandina beach facility can produce approximately  metric tons  or percent of the total capacity 
the company sells these performance fibers primarily to meet specific customer needs to produce a wide variety of consumer and industrial products throughout the world 
approximately percent of rayonier s performance fibers sales are exported primarily to customers in asia  europe and latin america 
approximately percent of performance fibers sales are made directly by rayonier personnel  with the remainder made through independent sales agents primarily to export locations 
this segment includes two major product lines cellulose specialties and absorbent materials 
cellulose specialties rayonier is one of the world s leading producers of specialty cellulose products  most of which are used in dissolving chemical applications that require a highly purified form to produce cellulose acetate and ethers that create high value  technologically demanding cellulose specialty products 
these products are used in a wide variety of end uses such as acetate textile fibers  rigid packaging  photographic film  impact resistant plastics  cigarette filters  high tenacity rayon yarn for tires and industrial hoses  pharmaceuticals  cosmetics  detergents  sausage casings  food products  thickeners for oil well drilling muds  lacquers  paints  printing inks  explosives and lcd screens 
in addition  cellulose specialties include high value specialty paper applications used for decorative laminates for counter tops  automotive air and oil filters  shoe innersoles  battery separators  circuit boards and filter media for the food industry 
absorbent materials rayonier is a supplier of performance fibers for absorbent hygiene products 
these fibers are typically referred to as fluff fibers and are used as an absorbent medium in products such as disposable baby diapers  feminine hygiene products  incontinence pads  convalescent bed pads  industrial towels and wipes and non woven fabrics 
the absorbent materials product line also includes paper applications that are made as a secondary product 
these applications usually represent less than percent of total performance fibers production and are used in the manufacture of bond  book and printing paper 
the company also produces and markets an ultra thin engineered absorbent core material that goes into super absorbent feminine hygiene and diaper products as well as other applications 
a  ton per year manufacturing facility in jesup  ga was completed in to bring manufacturing in house and aid in the continued development of these products 
in  this business represented approximately percent of the absorbent materials product line total sales 
wood products the wood products business segment manufactures and sells dimension and specialty lumber and mdf 
rayonier operates three lumber manufacturing facilities in the us that produce southern pine lumber generally used for residential construction and industrial uses 
the mills  located at baxley  swainsboro and eatonton  ga  have a combined annual capacity of approximately million board feet of lumber  while also producing approximately  tons of wood chips for pulp and paper manufacturing 
lumber sales are primarily to customers in the southeastern us rayonier personnel sell most of the lumber  however sales to certain export locations are made through independent agents 
approximately percent of the wood chip production is sold at market prices to rayonier s jesup  ga  performance fibers facility  accounting for approximately percent of that facility s total wood consumption 
the company operates a premium grade mdf facility in new zealand with an annual capacity of  cubic meters 
the company s mdf is marketed worldwide by rayonier personnel  independent sales agents and a new zealand distributor 
other rayonier operates domestic and export log trading businesses in the northwest us  new zealand and chile 
in the northwest us and in new zealand  all log trading sales are sourced externally 
chile s log trading activity relates to domestic purchases and sales  while their wood products sales are primarily intercompany sales that are exported to the us rayonier also trades wood products  purchasing lumber and wood panel products for sale in both domestic and export markets 
in  the company closed its russian sales office and discontinued exporting logs from this market 
discontinued operations and dispositions prior years dispositions and discontinued operations include rayonier s new zealand east coast timberland operations and associated assets that were sold for million in  its port angeles  wa performance fibers mill that was closed on february   its interest in the grays harbor  wa  pulp and paper complex  which was closed in  its wholly owned subsidiary  southern wood piedmont company swp  which ceased operations in except for remedial activities  its eastern research division  which ceased operations in  and other miscellaneous assets held for disposition 
also see note reserves for dispositions and discontinued operations 
foreign sales and operations rayonier s sales by geographical destination for the three years ended december   were as follows in millions sales by destination united states europe japan china other asia new zealand latin america canada all other the majority of sales to foreign countries are denominated in us dollars 
non us assets  primarily in new zealand  comprised approximately percent of total assets at the end of  and sales from non us operations comprised approximately percent of total sales

patents the company has a number of patents and pending patent applications that relate to its proprietary products and processes and intends to take such steps as are necessary to protect its patents and file applications for future inventions that are deemed important to its business operations 
competition rayonier s us timberlands are located in two major timber growing regions the northwest and the southeast  where timber markets are fragmented 
in the northwest us  the campbell group  john hancock mutual life insurance co  simpson timber company  weyerhaeuser  and washington state department of natural resources are significant competitive suppliers 
other competition in the northwest us arises from log imports from canada 
in the southeast us  the company competes with plum creek and international paper  among others 
in all markets  price is the principal method of competition 
export log markets are highly competitive 
logs are available from several countries and numerous suppliers 
in new zealand  major competitors include silva and pentarch forest products 
price and customer relationships are important methods of competition 
performance fibers are marketed worldwide against strong competition from domestic and foreign producers 
major competitors include international paper  weyerhaeuser  koch industries  and buckeye technologies 
in june of  international paper closed its natchez  mississippi mill  which was a major competitor in the cellulose acetate market  resulting in cellulose acetate price increases in and an increase in the company s market share 
rayonier continues to work towards the development of new products and processes that could add additional value to the performance fibers business 
pricing  product performance and technical service are principal methods of competition 
rayonier s lumber and mdf wood products compete with construction and furniture materials manufactured by other companies 
the benefits of incremental productivity improvements at the company s mdf plant and improving demand in key us  japanese and chinese markets have been offset by rising costs after currency translation due to the strengthening new zealand dollar in and customers in  the company had a group of customers under common control consisting of eastman chemical company and its affiliates whose total performance fibers purchases were approximately percent of rayonier s consolidated sales and percent of performance fibers sales 
in addition  performance fibers sales included a customer that purchased an amount equal to approximately percent of the segment s sales and three other customers who each purchased approximately to percent of the segment s sales 
the loss of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on this segment s results of operations 
no single customer or group of customers under common control purchased an amount greater than percent of the company s consolidated sales for the years ended december  or no other segment had a single customer with purchases greater than percent of its sales 
in the first quarter of  a private equity firm purchased one of the company s customers who accounted for approximately percent of the company s cellulose specialties sales 
in  the firm announced plans for an initial public offering of percent of this customer 
the company does not expect that this will have a material adverse effect on its performance fibers results of operations in in the northwest us  the majority of the company s customers are large businesses  while in the southeastern us the majority of customers are smaller  family owned businesses 
seasonality the company s us timber and real estate segment normally experiences lower sales in the third quarter of each year due to the greater availability of non rayonier timber during the drier summer harvesting period  particularly in the northwestern us the wood products segment may experience higher seasonal demand in the volume of lumber sold in the second quarter of each year primarily due to the relative strength of housing starts 
the performance fibers segment results are normally not impacted by seasonal changes  although many contracts are renewed on january each year 
environmental matters see environmental regulation in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note contingencies 
raw materials in the us  timber harvesting continues to be restricted by legislation  litigation and pressure from various preservationist groups 
timber supply is also subject to cyclical price swings in wood products and in pulp and paper markets  as well as wet weather conditions which restrict the ability to harvest 
in  the cellulose specialties product line s operating results reflected higher hardwood chip prices due to weather related supply shortages  however  in such costs declined as supply increased 
the company s performance fibers mills and southeastern us lumber facilities obtain their logs through open market purchases by the company s internal wood procurement organization which negotiates log prices with independent third party wood suppliers who arrange for delivery to the pulp mills  chip facilities and saw mills 
in some cases  the third party logging contractors may have purchased timber cutting rights from the company s timberlands in georgia and florida generally through a sealed bid process 
rayonier is continually pursuing reductions in usage and costs of other key raw materials  supplies and contract services at its performance fibers  mdf and lumber mills 
management foresees no material constraints in the near term from pricing or availability of its key raw materials 
research and development the company believes it maintains one of the preeminent performance fibers research facilities and staff in the forest products industry 
research and development efforts are directed primarily at further developing existing core products and technologies  improving the quality of cellulose fiber grades  absorbent materials and related products  improving manufacturing efficiency  reducing energy needs and developing improved environmental controls 
the research center is located adjacent to the performance fibers mill in jesup  ga 
research activities related to timber operations include genetic tree improvement programs as well as applied silvicultural programs to identify management practices that improve financial returns from timber assets

item legal proceedings rayonier is engaged in various legal actions  including certain environmental proceedings that are discussed more fully in note reserves for dispositions and discontinued operations and in note contingencies 
between and  southern wood piedmont swp  a subsidiary of the company  sent contaminated soil excavated in connection with the cleanup of various closed wood processing sites to a third party processor for recycling 
the processing facility closed in and is the subject of a variety of environmental related charges and a lawsuit brought by the us environmental protection agency epa and the louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq in june  in united states district court for the western district of louisiana against the owner of the processing facility 
also in dispute is a disposal liability for approximately  tons of recycled material from sites operated by swp that are still owned and retained by the processor 
currently there are no claims pending against the company or swp by the epa or the ldeq 
however  both have indicated that they believe swp may be liable for some portion of the costs of clean up and disposal of the recycled material sent to the processing site by swp 
if no settlement is reached in this matter  trial is scheduled to begin in september there are numerous possible outcomes that could determine the company s ultimate liability  if any 
the company believes that reserves at december  adequately reflect the probable costs to be incurred upon the ultimate resolution of the dispute 
in december  the united states commenced a lawsuit against the company in the united states district court for the western district of washington to recover approximately million in costs allegedly incurred by the epa in to conduct an expanded site investigation at the company s port angeles mill site 
rayonier challenged the epa s authority to recover this type of cost  as well as the validity of the amount spent 
trial in this matter commenced february  and concluded on february on february  the court ruled that the united states was entitled to approximately million of the approximately million claimed  and denied a request by the united states for an order permitting it to recover future costs relating to the port angeles site 
the united states filed a notice of appeal of this decision  but in october of withdrew its appeal 
the company has paid the million judgment and this matter is now closed

the company owns or leases under long term agreements approximately million acres in florida  georgia  alabama  washington and new zealand 
it is the th largest private landowner in the united states 
it has also been a supplier of premier cellulose specialty grades of pulp for over seventy five years 
the company has consistently produced strong cash flows and operating results  averaging above many forest products industry indices  by focusing on the following critical financial measures operating income  ebitda  operating funds flow  adjusted cash available for distribution  debt to capital ratio  return on equity  return on fair market value timber and real estate and return on capital employed performance fibers 
in addition to these financial measures  the company also focuses on cash available for distribution  in total and on a per share basis  to meet its targets for delivery of above average market returns 
key non financial measures include safety performance  quality  production as a percent of capacity and various yield statistics 
the company s focus is on maximizing returns for shareholders and generating consistent cash flows from its businesses 
as a reit  rayonier believes it will be more competitive in pursuing timberland acquisitions to further grow the company and ultimately distribute more of its earnings to shareholders in a tax efficient manner 
during the first year as a reit  the regular annual dividend increased to million from million in since  the company has used its cash flows to reduce debt by approximately million  resulting in a current debt to capital ratio of percent 
rayonier s management believes that a debt to capital range of to percent is appropriate to keep its weighted average cost of capital low while maintaining its investment grade debt rating and retaining the flexibility to actively pursue growth opportunities 
the company had million of medium term notes mature in february that were repaid with borrowings from the company s revolving credit facility 
the company s taxable reit subsidiary trs increased its debt by million primarily due to the purchase of timberlands from rayonier forest resources  l 
p 
rfr to then be sold to third parties as higher and better use hbu real estate 
these borrowings were drawn from the revolving credit facility 
see liquidity and capital resources for additional information regarding this intercompany transaction 
the company anticipates using cash flow from operating activities to further reduce debt in operational strategies timber is sold primarily through an auction process  although in the northwest us it also markets timber through log supply agreements 
timber and real estate is treated as a stand alone business  requiring company mills and trading groups to compete with third party bidders for timber at auction 
this methodology of selling promotes that the highest value is received  generating a true reflection of fair value returns in timber and real estate 
the structure also minimizes the possibility of the company s manufacturing facilities being subsidized with below market cost wood  and enables them to procure wood at the lowest cost 
the company also focuses on optimizing timber value returns by continually improving productivity and yields through advanced silvicultural practices which take into account soil  climate and biological considerations 
a formal timberland sales program instituted in was designed to realize  on a current basis  a portion of the appreciated value of the underlying land asset 
pursuant to such program  the company has been identifying for sale  on an annual basis  approximately to percent of its timberland holdings  primarily properties with values that are greater for development or conservation use than for growing timber 
rayonier expects to periodically replenish its timberlands primarily through large scale  strategic acquisitions 
in conjunction with this strategy and its conversion to a reit in  the company can only market hbu properties to third parties from its trs  which may cause the trs to borrow funds to finance periodic timberland purchases from the reit 
in  the company acquired  acres of timberland in southern alabama from great eastern timber company  llc and the trs purchased  acres of hbu land and other properties from the reit 
in performance fibers  the focus has been to increase the company s position as a premier supplier of cellulose specialties while reducing its participation in the more commodity oriented absorbent materials primarily fluff pulp market 
in the cellulose specialties market  where the company is a market leader  its considerable technical applications expertise is used in customer support and in customizing product to exacting specifications  which allows differentiation from most other competitors 
conversely  fluff pulp is a commodity with very little opportunity for differentiation other than by price  however  the company continues to explore methods for enhancing the value of these fibers 
there are a number of much larger companies in the fluff pulp market and as a result  the company is not a market leader and has been successful in executing a strategy of shifting sales from absorbent materials to cellulose specialties production 
in  percent of its volume was cellulose specialties  versus percent and percent in and  respectively 
however  while a further shift of volume to the cellulose specialties product line will be challenging  the company will continue to focus on improving product mix within the cellulose specialty product line 
cost control is also a key element to remaining competitive in the performance fibers markets 
the company s focus is on keeping its mills operating continuously  safely  and efficiently while closely managing raw materials and conversion costs 
the company s capital expenditures typically are directed toward cost reduction and efficiency projects 
industry and market conditions market conditions over the past three years have been mixed 
in us timber markets  late saw a recovery in prices compared to a declining market trend beginning in this improvement continued through as demand for lumber improved due to strong housing  commercial construction and industrial markets  a competitive exchange rate and tariffs imposed on wood imports from canada 
in the southeast us  the impact of three major hurricanes in resulted in lower volumes and some price erosion 
the company s southeast us hbu properties have consistently generated strong interest which continued throughout in performance fibers  cellulose specialties market demand has been strong 
sales are typically made using one to three year contracts which establish prices and target volumes at the beginning of the year and buffer some of the changes in supply and demand 
the company s recognized technical and market leadership has allowed it to maintain relatively stable pricing across its cellulose specialties product lines 
in  international paper closed its natchez  mississippi mill  a major cellulose specialties competitor  taking approximately  tons of capacity out of the market 
this was the primary driver of price and volume increases in that product line 
over the past three years  absorbent materials industry capacity has exceeded demand resulting in price movement within a relatively low cyclical range 
absorbent materials are primarily a commodity product  with little product differentiation or enhancement 
sales are typically made with an annual volume agreement that allows price to move with the market during the year 
absorbent materials prices strengthened in  consistent with the commodity paper pulp market  while volumes were relatively stable 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of rayonier s financial statements requires the company to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  reported in this annual report on form k 
the company bases these estimates and assumptions on historical data and trends  current fact patterns  expectations and other sources of information it believes are reasonable 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions 
merchantable inventory and depletion costs as determined by forestry timber harvest models significant assumptions and estimates are used in the recording of timberland inventory cost and depletion 
rayonier employs a forestry technical services group at each of its timberland management locations 
merchantable standing timber inventory is estimated annually  using industry standard computer software 
the inventory calculation takes into account growth  in growth annual transfer of oldest pre merchantable age class into the merchantable inventory  timberland sales and the annual harvest specific to each business unit 
the age at which timber is considered merchantable is reviewed periodically and updated for changing harvest practices  future harvest age profiles and biological growth factors 
an annual business unit depletion rate is established by dividing merchantable inventory book cost by standing merchantable inventory 
pre merchantable records are maintained for each planted year age class  recording acres planted  stems per acre  and costs of planting and tending 
changes in the assumptions and or estimations used in these calculations may affect the company s results  in particular  timber inventory and depletion costs 
factors that can impact timber volume include weather changes  losses due to natural causes  differences in actual versus estimated growth rates and changes in the age when timber is considered merchantable 
a percent company wide change in estimated standing merchantable inventory would cause depletion expense to change by approximately million 
the  acre timberland acquisition which closed in august resulted in a higher depletion rate in the southeast which increased depletion expense by approximately million in it is anticipated that the full year impact will increase depletion expense by approximately million to million 
in  the southeast pine merchantable age was reduced from nineteen years to sixteen years 
this change  which reduced the depletion rate by percent in that region  decreased depletion expense by million in depreciation of long lived assets as specifically affected by economic obsolescence depreciation expense is computed using the units of production method for the performance fibers and mdf production plants and equipment and the straight line method on all other property  plant and equipment over the useful economic lives of the assets involved 
management believes these depreciation methods are the most appropriate under the circumstances as they most closely match revenues with expenses versus other generally accepted accounting methods 
long lived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
cash flows used in such impairment analyses are based on budgeted results  which take into account recent sales and cost data as well as macro economic drivers including customer demand  industry capacity and foreign exchange rates 
the physical life of equipment  however  may be shortened by economic obsolescence caused by environmental regulation  competition and other causes 
environmental costs associated with dispositions and discontinued operations rayonier has million of liabilities accrued for environmental costs relating to past dispositions and discontinued operations that will be spent over the next years 
see note  reserves for dispositions and discontinued operations  for additional information 
significant estimates are used in determining the proper value of these obligations at a given point in time  especially due to the long term nature of the obligations 
typically these cost estimates do not vary significantly on a quarter to quarter basis 
factors affecting these estimates include  but are not limited to  technological and regulatory changes  results from ongoing work and management s judgment 
management periodically reviews the company s environmental liabilities and also engages third party consultants to assess the extent of additional work required due to changes in applicable law and new technologies potentially affecting the remediation of contaminated sites that could impact management s estimates 
a material change in an estimate in any given period could have a favorable or unfavorable effect on the results of the company s operations 
the most recent material change in estimate occurred in  when reserves were increased by million for revised estimates of remediation costs required at the company s closed washington sites  including its port angeles mill site 
expenditures for all such environmental costs totaled million in and are expected to increase to million in primarily as a result of increased spending required at the company s washington state and southern wood piedmont sites 
annual expenditures in and are expected to be in the million to million range 
determining the adequacy of pension assets and liabilities the company maintains four qualified benefit plans which cover substantially all of its us workforce and an unfunded plan to provide benefits in excess of amounts allowable under current tax law to participants in the qualified plans 
pension expense for all plans was million in numerous estimates and assumptions are required to determine the proper amount of pension and postretirement liabilities and annual expense to record in the company s financial statements 
the key assumptions include discount rate  return on assets  salary increases  health care cost trends  mortality rates  longevity and service lives of employees 
although there is authoritative guidance on how to select most of these assumptions  the company s management and its actuary exercise some degree of judgment when selecting these assumptions 
selecting different assumptions  as well as actual versus expected results  would change the net periodic benefit cost and funded status of the benefit plans recognized in the financial statements 
in determining pension expense in  a million return on pension assets was assumed based on an expected long term rate of return of percent 
the actual return for was million 
this long term return assumption calculated using geometric compound averaging was established based on historical long term rates of return on broad equity and bond indices  discussions with the company s actuary and investment advisors and consideration of the actual annualized rate of return of percent from the date of the company s spin off from itt corporation through for  the long term rate of return assumption will be kept at percent 
management reviews this assumption periodically to ensure that it remains reasonable 
at december  the company s asset mix consisted of percent equities  percent bonds and cash equivalents and percent real estate 
the company does not expect this mix to change materially in the near future 
the formula to calculate retirement benefits uses percent of final average compensation for all years of service 
in determining its future pension obligations  the company selects a discount rate based on rates supplied by its actuary that incorporates high quality aaa and aa rated  long term corporate bond rates into its models 
the discount rate at december  of percent declined from the year end rate of percent  causing the projected benefit obligation pbo to increase by million 
the company expects its pension expense to increase to million from million recorded in primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate from percent to percent 
future pension expense will be impacted by many factors including actual investment performance  changes in discount rates  timing of contributions and other employee related matters 
the sensitivity of pension expense and obligations to changes in economic assumptions is highlighted below impact on change in assumption pension expense pbo bp decrease in discount rate million million bp increase in discount rate million million bp decrease in long term return on assets million bp increase in long term return on assets million the company s pension plans were underfunded by million at december   an million improvement to the december  position primarily due to discretionary contributions of million made during the year 
in  million was also contributed to meet the minimum funding requirements for the plan year 
the company had no minimum funding requirement for the plan year 
there are no required quarterly pension contributions for  however  the company expects to contribute between million and million to further reduce the underfunded amount 
future funding requirements will vary depending on actual investment performance  changes in valuation assumptions  current liability interest rates  other employee related matters and changes in legislation 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act the act was enacted in december which introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare part d and a federal subsidy to sponsors of postretirement benefit plans that provide a prescription drug benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit provided by medicare part d 
the company s actuary has not yet determined whether or not the company s postretirement benefit plan provides benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d under the act 
as such  the effects of this act have not been reflected in the company s accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or net periodic postretirement benefit cost 
realizability of both recorded and unrecorded tax assets and liabilities with the conversion to reit tax status effective january   the company s income tax provision and deferred tax balances changed materially 
certain activities no longer require tax provisions  and the opportunity to capture tax benefits associated with its reit status has increased 
the realization of these tax opportunities requires extensive tax planning and in many cases is dependent upon events in the future and the company s strategy in structuring transactional terms and conditions 
as a result  the effective tax rate and amount of taxes paid during various fiscal periods can vary greatly 
also  the company s projection of its estimated tax for the year and its provision for quarterly taxes  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  could result in greater variability than in the past 
similarly  the opportunity to realize certain deferred tax assets  or to estimate deferred tax liabilities  may be more subjective than in the past 
for example  the company has recorded certain deferred tax assets that management believes will be realized in future periods 
these assets are reviewed periodically in order to assess their realizability 
this review requires management to make assumptions and estimates about future profitability affecting the realization of these tax benefits 
if the review indicates that the realizability may be less than likely  a valuation allowance will be made at that time 
as a reit  if certain requirements are met  only the taxable reit subsidiaries will be subject to corporate income taxes 
however  the company is subject to corporate taxes on built in gains the excess of fair market value over tax basis at january  on taxable sales of property from the reit during the first ten years following the election to be taxed as a reit 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company must estimate the amount of reit property that will be sold within the next ten years and retain a deferred tax liability for the expected income tax on the book tax differences related to these dispositions 
the remaining deferred tax liability of million resulting from us timberland temporary differences was reversed in first quarter and recorded as an income tax benefit 
an estimate of taxable dispositions within the ten year post reit conversion period will be updated periodically and may fluctuate significantly based on market conditions and other factors related to meeting the reit qualifying tests 
the built in gains tax can typically be eliminated if sales proceeds are reinvested in similar property within required time periods like kind exchanges  so long as the replacement property is owned until expiration of the ten year holding period 
however  this does not restrict the company s ability to sell timber on a pay as cut basis from such replacement property during this period 
the company completed a like kind exchange transaction in and expects to actively pursue additional like kind exchange opportunities in the future  but it is impossible to predict the outcome of such efforts 
in addition  prior to march   the company did not provide for taxes on approximately million of undistributed foreign earnings as the company had intended to reinvest such earnings overseas in the future 
following the conversion to a reit  the company s strategy was reevaluated with a greater likelihood of most future investments being made in us timberlands 
as a result  in  the company recognized million of tax expense on undistributed foreign earnings that it expects will ultimately be repatriated 
this amount will fluctuate due to subsequent exchange rate changes until actual repatriation takes place 
on october   the american jobs creation act the ajca was signed into law 
the ajca includes a deduction of percent of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the ajca 
in  the company may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings that approximate million at december  at the current exchange rate 
the company has started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision  however  it may not be able to complete this evaluation until after congress passes the proposed technical corrections bill related to the repatriation provision and or the treasury department provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision 
the clarifying language is expected to affect the company s evaluation of the economic value of meeting the overall criteria and implementing the provision 
the company expects to complete its evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision within a reasonable period of time following the issuance of additional guidance 
revenue recognition the company has several different methods for recognizing revenue in each of its business segments 
these policies are critical to the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the following summarizes our revenue recognition policies revenue is recognized when the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the company s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of timber is recorded when title passes to the buyer 
timber sales in the southeast us and northwest us are primarily made on a pay as cut basis  which qualify for capital gains treatment under section b of the internal revenue code irc 
these contracts generally require a minimum percent initial payment and title and risk of loss are transferred when the timber is cut 
in new zealand  pay as cut contracts are also utilized which require a cash deposit or performance bond 
payments are made and title and risk of loss are transferred as the timber is cut 
in a few cases  in new zealand  lump sum contracts are utilized which require a percent initial deposit 
title and risk of loss are transferred at the time of deposit and advance installment payments are required in order for the contracted volume of timber to be cut 
real estate sales are recorded when title passes and when full payment or a minimum down payment of percent is received and full collectibility is assured 
if a down payment of less than percent is received at closing  the company records revenue based on the installment method 
the same revenue recognition policy is followed when recording intercompany real estate sales from the reit to the trs  which eliminate upon consolidation 
revenue from domestic sales of performance fibers products is recorded when goods are shipped and title passes 
foreign sales of performance fibers products are recorded when the customer or agent receives the goods and title passes 
lumber and mdf sales are recorded when the goods are shipped and title passes 
the company s other segment includes log sales and wood products trading sales 
in the northwestern us and in chile  all log trading sales are domestic and revenue is recorded when the goods are received by the customer and title passes 
in new zealand  approximately half of the log trading sales are exported 
domestic new zealand sales are recorded when the goods are received by the customer and title passes 
revenue on export sales is recorded when the goods are shipped to the customer and title passes 
revenue is recognized on domestic wood products trading sales when the product arrives at the contracted destination and title passes 
export wood products trading revenue is recognized when the product is shipped and title passes

management considers these measures to be important to estimate the enterprise and shareholder values of the company as a whole and of its core segments  and for allocating capital resources 
in addition  analysts  investors and creditors use these measures when analyzing the financial condition and cash generating ability of the company 
ebitda is defined by the securities and exchange commission  however  adjusted cad as defined may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
ebitda is a non gaap measure of the operating cash generating capacity of the company 
in  ebitda was million  an increase of million over the increase is primarily due to higher operating results in the performance fibers and wood product segments as well as lower working capital requirements partly offset by higher pension contributions 
in  ebitda was million  a decrease of million from this decrease was primarily due to lower operating results  higher pension contributions and a million tax and interest deposit 
below is a reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to ebitda for the five year period ended december  in millions of dollars cash provided by operating activities non cash cost basis of real estate sold income tax benefit expense interest expense working capital increases decreases other balance sheet changes ebitda a non cash expense critical to the economics of our timber and real estate core business is the non cash cost basis of real estate sold 
ebitda plus the non cash cost basis of real estate sold for the five years ended december     and  totaled million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
adjusted cad is a non gaap measure of cash generated during a period that is available for dividend distribution  repurchase of the company s common shares  debt reduction and for strategic acquisitions net of associated financing eg realizing like kind exchange benefits 
the company defines cash available for distribution cad as cash provided by operating activities less capital spending  the tax benefit on the exercise of stock options  the tax benefits associated with certain strategic acquisitions and the change in committed cash 
committed cash represents outstanding checks that have been drawn on the company s zero balance bank accounts but have not been paid 
in compliance with securities and exchange commission requirements for non gaap measures  the company also reduces cad by mandatory debt repayments resulting in the measure entitled adjusted cad 
adjusted cad was million in  an increase of million from the increase primarily results from the million increase in cash provided by operating activities partially offset  on a pro forma basis  by million in income taxes that would have been paid absent qualifying irc section exchange acquisitions 
in addition  mandatory debt repayments were higher in by million subsequently refinanced  further reducing adjusted cad 
adjusted cad generated in is not necessarily indicative of the amounts that may be generated in future periods 
adjusted cad was million in  million above the million generated in this increase was primarily due to lower mandatory debt repayments in of million  partially offset by lower cash provided by operating activities and higher capital expenditures 
below is a reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to adjusted cad for the five year period ended december  in millions cash provided by operating activities capital spending  net purchase of assets previously leased lke tax benefits on third party real estate sales lke tax benefits on intercompany real estate sales change in committed cash tax benefit on exercise of stock options cad mandatory debt repayments adjusted cad represents income taxes that would have been paid had the company not completed the lke transactions 
mandatory repayments represent debt that matured and settled during the same year 
in addition to the mandatory payments  discretionary debt repayments of  million  million  million and million were made in    and  respectively 
in  adjusted cad was utilized to fund cash dividends and to partly fund the acquisition of the andalusia property of million  net of lke tax benefits on both intercompany and third party sales of million 
rayonier defines custodial capital spending  a non gaap measure  as capital expenditures  net of proceeds from retirements  required to maintain its current earnings level over the cycle and to keep facilities and equipment in safe and reliable condition as well as in compliance with regulatory requirements 
the measure is important to properly evaluate the company s cash requirements  to forecast potential uses of cash and for use in valuation models 
the company has a system in place to classify capital spending projects as either custodial or discretionary prior to approval and to track expenditures accordingly  however  the determination of discretionary versus custodial spending still requires some level of management judgment and such limitation should be considered when using this measure 
in  net capital expenditures of million included million of custodial capital spending  of which million was for environmental requirements 
discretionary spending of million was for numerous projects including a kiln conversion at the swainsboro sawmill  turbine generator upgrades at the jesup and fernandina mills  and lumber processing equipment at the eatonton sawmill 
capital projects include profit improvement  custodial capital  timberlands reforestation and various projects to comply with new environmental laws and requirements 
as new environmental regulations are promulgated  additional capital spending may be required 
for additional information concerning environmental expenditures  see environmental regulation 
below is a reconciliation of capital expenditures  net of sales and retirements to custodial capital spending  for the five year period ended december  in millions capital expenditures  net of sales and retirements less discretionary spending custodial capital spending excludes strategic alabama andalusia timberlands acquisition 
liquidity facilities in november  a new million unsecured revolving credit facility was negotiated with a group of banks that replaced the previous million facility and rfr s million facility 
the new facility allows the parent company  rayonier inc and its subsidiaries  trs and rfr  to borrow up to a combined total of million and expires november at december   there was million outstanding on the revolving credit facility  million from refinancing medium term notes that matured in february  while the remaining million was primarily due to financing the intercompany timberland sale from rfr to the trs 
there were no borrowings outstanding as of december  standard poor s ratings services assigned the facility and the company s long term debt its bbb investment grade rating with a stable outlook 
moody s investors service assigned the facility and the company s long term debt its baa investment grade rating with a negative outlook 
the negative outlook reflects concerns by moody s over the company s ability to maintain its timberland cash flow and asset base  the potential for structural subordination of future debt placements and the cyclicality of its performance fibers business 
in conjunction with the company s million revolving credit facility  certain covenants must be met  including ratios based on the facility s definition of ebitda covenant ebitda 
covenant ebitda consists of earnings from continuing operations before the cumulative effect of accounting changes and any provision for dispositions  income taxes  interest expense  depreciation  depletion  amortization and the non cash cost basis of real estate sold 
in addition  there are covenant requirements in effect for rfr on the ratio of cash flow available for fixed charges to fixed charges 
a dividend restriction covenant limits the sum of dividends in any period of four fiscal quarters to percent of covenant funds from operations covenant ffo plus the aggregate amount of dividends permitted under covenant ffo in excess of the amount of dividends paid during the prior four fiscal quarters 
covenant ffo is defined as consolidated net income excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and investments in marketable securities plus depletion  depreciation and amortization and the non cash cost basis of real estate sold 
the covenants listed below are calculated on a trailing month basis 
the most restrictive long term debt covenants in effect as of december   were as follows covenant requirement actual ratio at december  favorable unfavorable covenant ebitda to consolidated interest expense should not be less than to to total debt to covenant ebitda should not exceed to to rfr cash flow available for fixed charges to rfr fixed charges should not be less than to to dividends paid should not exceed percent of covenant ffo the company is currently in compliance with all of its financial covenants 
in addition to the financial covenants listed above  the credit agreements include customary covenants that limit the incurrence of debt  the disposition of assets  and the making of certain payments between rfr and rayonier among others 
an asset sales covenant in the company s rfr installment note related agreements requires the company  subject to certain exceptions  to either reinvest cumulative timberland sales proceeds in excess of million the excess proceeds in timberland related investments and activities or  once the amount of excess proceeds not reinvested exceeds million  to make an offer to the note holders to prepay the notes ratably in the amount of the excess proceeds 
as of december  and  the amount of excess proceeds was approximately million 
equity resources at the may annual shareholders meeting  the company s shareholders approved an increase in authorized shares of common stock to  at december  and  the company had  and  common shares issued and outstanding  respectively 
in  rayonier began a common share repurchase program to minimize the dilutive effect on earnings per share of its employee incentive stock plans 
this program limits the number of shares that may be purchased each year to the greater of percent of outstanding shares at the beginning of the year or the number of incentive shares actually issued to employees during the year 
in october  the board of directors authorized the purchase of an additional million shares 
these shares were authorized separately from the percent of outstanding shares anti dilutive program  neither of which have expiration dates 
below is a summary of the share repurchases for  and shares authorized for repurchase shares repurchased cost of repurchased shares in thousands average cost per share amounts do not roll forward as shares authorized for repurchase are calculated based on shares outstanding at the beginning of each year 
contractual financial obligations and off balance sheet arrangements in addition to using cash flow from operations  the company finances its operations through the issuance of debt  and by entering into leases 
these financial obligations are recorded in accordance with accounting rules applicable to the underlying transaction  with the result that some are recorded as liabilities on the balance sheet  while others are required to be disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis 
the following table aggregates the company s contractual financial obligations as of december  and anticipated cash spending by period payments due by period contractual financial obligations s total thereafter current maturities of long term debt long term debt operating leases timberland operating leases pp e  offices capital leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations the majority of timberland leases are subject to escalation clauses based on either the consumer price index or the producer price index 
the nature and purpose of off balance sheet arrangements are sometimes to provide credit support for certain suppliers vendors and customers in case of their default on critical company related obligations  and collateral for certain self insurance programs that the company maintains 
these arrangements consist of standby letters of credit and surety bonds 
as part of its ongoing operations  the company may also periodically issue guarantees to third parties 
off balance sheet arrangements are not considered to be a source of liquidity or capital resource and do not expose the company to material risks or material unfavorable financial impacts 
the following table aggregates financial commitments as of december  financial commitments s maximum potential payment carrying amount of liability standby letters of credit guarantees surety bonds total financial commitments approximately million of the standby letters of credit serve as credit support for industrial revenue bonds 
the remaining letters of credit support various insurance coverages  primarily workers compensation and pollution requirements 
these letters of credit expire at various dates during and are typically rolled over as required 
in conjunction with the sale of the new zealand east coast timber operations in  the company guaranteed five years of crown forest license obligations 
in late  the buyer defaulted on its loan payments to its creditors and went into receivership with the obligation paid by the receiver 
the property was then re sold 
the new owner is the primary obligor and has posted a bank performance bond with the new zealand government 
if the new owner fails to pay the obligations  the new zealand government will demand payment from the owner s bankers pursuant to the bond 
the company would have to perform under the guarantee and seek legal redress from the owner if the bankers defaulted on the bond 
the company expects the owner s bond to be sufficient to cover the license obligations 
as of december   three years of obligations remained  estimated at million per year 
this guarantee expires in in  the company sold approximately  acres of timberland for approximately million 
as payment for this property  a year installment note was received from the buyer  with a fixed interest rate of percent 
in addition  the buyer delivered an irrevocable letter of credit from a major banking institution that secures all payments of principal and interest under the installment note

in conjunction with creating this new deduction  the act phases out the current extraterritorial income exclusion eie over the next two years 
the fsp requires that the new deduction be accounted for as a special deduction because the deduction is based on the future performance of specific activities  including level of wages

this fsp provides reporting guidance for companies that have not made an actuarial determination and accounting guidance for when the determination is made 
the company s actuary is still determining the actuarially equivalent benefit and the company complied with the reporting guidance in the fsp  which was effective july  in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the interpretation requires consolidation of entities with certain equity characteristics that are controlled through interests other than a majority of voting rights 
the company adopted the original fin on july  this initial adoption did not impact rayonier s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows in in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin fin r to clarify and expand on accounting guidance for variable interest entities vies 
the application of fin r for companies with interests in a vie is required for fiscal years ending after december  the company did not have any unconsolidated variable interests that require consolidation under fin r as of december  and  and as a result  there was no impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows upon adoption on january  environmental regulation rayonier is subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations concerning air emissions  water discharges and waste handling and disposal 
such environmental laws and regulations include the federal clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  and state laws and regulations governing similar activities 
management closely monitors its environmental responsibilities  and similar state laws and regulations  and believes that the company is in substantial compliance with current environmental requirements 
it is the opinion of management that substantial expenditures over the next years will be required in the area of environmental compliance 
during  and  rayonier spent approximately million  million and million  respectively  for capital projects related to environmental compliance for ongoing operations 
during and  rayonier expects spending to decrease to approximately million per year on such capital projects  primarily related to cluster rule compliance as discussed below 
the environmental protection agency epa finalized its cluster rules governing air emissions in but  due to the specialty nature of rayonier s performance fibers products and operations  the agency postponed finalizing water discharge rules and certain air emissions rules governing the company s two performance fibers dissolving pulp mills and two other similar mills 
in late  epa informed the company that it was delegating its cluster rule rulemaking authority for these four mills to the environmental agencies of the respective states 
rayonier will continue to work with the epa and the applicable state environmental authorities to establish such rules for its mills  but the timing and costs associated with such rulemaking are uncertain 
in the opinion of management  capital costs to be incurred over the next five years associated with cluster rule compliance and other environmental regulations are not expected to exceed million 
such capital expenditures are not expected to cause total capital expenditures to exceed an annual average of million to million 
federal  state and local laws and regulations intended to protect threatened and endangered species  as well as wetlands and waterways  limit and may prevent timber harvesting  road building and other activities on private lands  including a portion of the company s timberlands 
in the northwest  in particular  over the past several years the harvest of timber from parts of the company s timberlands in the state of washington has been both temporarily and permanently restricted as a result of the listing of the northern spotted owl  the marbled murrelet and several species of salmon and trout as threatened species under the endangered species act 
in  the timber industry and federal  state  local and tribal governments  entered into an agreement  known as the forests and fish report  which led the washington forest practices board to adopt rules further restricting timber harvesting within buffers along streams with fish habitat 
all of these restrictions have caused rayonier over time to restructure and reschedule its harvest plans and have reduced the total volume of timber available for harvest 
for the most part  however  these restrictions had been anticipated and the company expects to sustain past harvest levels in the foreseeable future 
with respect to dispositions and discontinued operations  rayonier currently estimates that expenditures during for environmental remediation and monitoring costs for all dispositions and discontinued operations will total approximately million to million per year 
such costs  including monitoring and remediation costs  will be charged against its reserves for estimated environmental obligations which the company believes are sufficient for costs expected to be incurred over the next years with respect to dispositions and discontinued operations 
at december   these reserves totaled approximately million 
the actual future environmental costs will be dependent on the outcome of negotiations with federal and state agencies and may also be affected by changes in applicable laws and regulations  the exercise of discretion in interpretation of applicable law and regulations by governmental agencies and changes in environmental remediation technology 
based on information currently available  management does not believe that any future changes in estimates would materially affect rayonier s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market and other economic risks rayonier is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
the company s objective is to minimize the economic impact of these market risks 
derivatives are used in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the finance committee of the board of directors and are managed by a senior executive committee whose responsibilities include initiating  managing and monitoring resulting exposures 
the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
cyclical pricing of commodity market paper pulp ultimately influences performance fibers prices  particularly in the absorbent materials product line 
however  since rayonier is a non integrated producer of specialized performance fibers for non papermaking end uses  its high value product mix tends to lag on both the upturn and downturn commodity paper pulp prices with peaks and valleys that are less severe 
most of rayonier s revenues and expenses are us dollar denominated 
however  the company does have some risk within its new zealand operation related to foreign currency pricing and costs and periodically enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the risks of foreign currency fluctuations 
at december   the company held foreign currency contracts to purchase new zealand dollars maturing through june totaling million 
the fair value of outstanding foreign currency contracts at year end was an asset of approximately million 
market risk resulting from a hypothetical cent change in the new zealand dollar us dollar exchange rate on the outstanding foreign currency contracts amounts to an approximate change of million in pre tax income loss 
rayonier periodically enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate changes 
these swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments without exchanging principal amounts 
at december   two interest rate swap agreements were held 
one agreement with a notional amount of million swaps a fixed percent interest rate for a six month libor rate plus percent 
the second agreement with a notional amount of million swaps a fixed percent interest rate for a six month libor rate plus percent 
the fair value of these interest rate swaps at year end  which mature in  was a liability of million 
market risk resulting from a one percentage point basis points change in the six month libor rate amounts to an approximate change of million in pre tax income loss 
the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is also subject to interest rate risk  however  rayonier intends to hold most of its debt until maturity 
occasionally  callable bonds will be refinanced at the company s option if favorable economic conditions exist 
the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt at december   was million compared to million in carrying value 
generally  the fair market value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
a hypothetical one percentage point increase decrease in prevailing interest rates at december   would result in a corresponding decrease increase in the fair value of our fixed rate debt of approximately million 
the company periodically enters into commodity forward contracts to fix portions of its fuel oil and natural gas costs 
the forward contracts partially reduce the risk of a change in performance fibers margins resulting from an increase or decrease in these energy costs 
the company does not enter into commodity forwards for trading or speculative purposes 
the net amounts paid or received under the contracts are recognized as an adjustment to fuel oil or natural gas expense 
at december   the company held contracts that fixed  barrels of fuel oil at for the first quarter of   barrels at for the second quarter of and  barrels at for the third quarter of the company also held contracts that fixed  decatherms of natural gas at for the first quarter of   decatherms at for the second quarter of   decatherms at for the third quarter of and  decatherms at for the fourth quarter of safe harbor comments about anticipated demand  pricing  volumes  earnings  land sales and timberland acquisitions are forward looking and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements changes in global market trends and world events  interest rate and currency movements  fluctuations in demand for or supply of cellulose specialties  absorbent materials  timber  wood products or real estate and entry of new competitors into these markets  adverse weather conditions affecting production  timber availability and sales  or distribution  changes in production costs for wood products or performance fibers  particularly for raw materials such as wood  energy and chemicals  unexpected delays in the closing of real estate transactions  changes in law or policy that might limit or restrict the development of real estate  particularly in the southeastern us  the ability of the company to identify and complete timberland acquisitions  the company s ability to satisfy complex rules in order to qualify as a reit  the availability of tax deductions and the ability of the company to complete tax efficient exchanges of real estate  and implementation or revision of governmental policies and regulations affecting the environment  endangered species  import and export controls or taxes  including changes in tax laws that could reduce the benefits associated with reit status
