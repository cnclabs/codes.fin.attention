item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general the following commentary discusses major components of our business and presents an overview of our consolidated financial position at december   and  as well as results of operations for the periods ended december    and this discussion should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other statistical information presented elsewhere in this prospectus 
our subsidiary banks operate autonomously  with separate local identities  management teams and decision making processes  and without strict operating control from the holding company 
the following commentary is being presented on a consolidated basis 
we are not aware of any current recommendations by any regulatory authorities that  if they were implemented  would have a material effect on our liquidity  capital resources or results of operations 
overview premier community bankshares  incorporated premier or the corporation is a virginia multi bank holding company headquartered in winchester  virginia 
the corporation owns the marathon bank and rockingham heritage bank and its subsidiary  rhb services  inc the corporation and its subsidiaries  the marathon bank and rockingham heritage bank are engaged in the business of offering banking services to the general public 
premier offers checking accounts  savings and time deposits  and commercial  real estate  personal  home improvement  automobile and other installment and term loans 
the corporation also offers financial services  travelers checks  safe deposit boxes  collection  notary public and other customary bank services with the exception of trust services to its customers 
the three principal types of loans made by premier are commercial and industrial loans  real estate loans  and loans to individuals for household  family and other consumer expenditures 
the corporation intends to organize a third bank in west virginia  which will be named premier bank 
the corporation plans to locate premier bank s headquarters in martinsburg and its initial branch office in shepherdstown  west virginia 
it is expected that premier bank will open in the second quarter of the banking charter has been received from the state of west virginia  as well as approval for deposit insurance from the fdic 
premier bank was originally expected to open during the third quarter of  but was unable to do so due to unexpected delays in the local government planning process 
premier bank will offer a wide variety of deposits and loans  including residential loans  commercial loans and commercial construction and development loans 
the corporation currently operates a loan production office in the martinsburg area  which was approved by west virginia s division of banking on october  net interest income is our primary source of revenue 
we define revenue as net interest income plus non interest income 
as discussed further in the interest rate sensitivity section  we manage our balance sheet and interest rate risk to both maximize and stabilize net interest income 
we do this by monitoring the spread between the interest rates we earn on interest earning assets such as loans  and the interest rates we pay on interest bearing liabilities such as deposit accounts 
we attempt to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk  but are unable to eliminate it 
in addition to management of interest rate risk  we analyze our loan portfolio for credit risk 
risk of loan defaults and foreclosures are unavoidable in the banking industry  and we try to limit our exposure to this risk by carefully underwriting and monitoring our extension of credit 
in addition to net interest income  non interest income is an i ncreasingly important source of income for our corporation 
non interest income is derived chiefly from service charges on deposit accounts  such as charges for non sufficient funds and atm fees  as well as commissions and fees from bank services  such as mortgage originations and debit and credit card processing 
caution about forward looking statements we make forward looking statements in this annual report that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements include statements regarding our profitability  liquidity  allowance for loan losses  interest rate sensitivity  market risk  growth strategy  and financial and other goals 
the words believes  expects  may  will  should  projects  contemplates  anticipates  forecasts  intends  or other similar words or terms are intended to identify forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to significant uncertainties because they are based upon or are affected by factors including  but not limited to the ability to successfully manage our growth or implement our growth strategies if we are unable to identify attractive markets  locations or opportunities to expand in the future  maintaining capital levels adequate to support our growth  maintaining cost controls and asset qualities as we open or acquire new branches  reliance on our management team  including our ability to attract and retain key personnel  the successful management of interest rate risk  changes in general economic and business conditions in our market area  changes in interest rates and interest rate policies  risks inherent in making loans such as repayment risks and fluctuating collateral values  competition with other banks and financial institutions  and companies outside of the banking industry  including those companies that have substantially greater access to capital and other resources  demand  development and acceptance of new products and services  problems with technology utilized by us  changing trends in customer profiles and behavior  and changes in banking and other laws and regulations applicable to us 
because of these uncertainties  our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward looking statements 
in addition  our past results of operations do not necessarily indicate our future results 
financial overview at december  we had total assets of million  net loans of million  deposits of million and shareholders equity of million 
the increase in assets was over the amount at december   while net loans and deposits increased and  respectively  for the same period 
our earnings per share  on a fully diluted basis  for the year ended december  was  which represented an increase of  or  over earnings per share  on a fully diluted basis  of for the same period the increase is partially attributable to a increase in net interest income over the same periods  due to strong growth in our earning assets 
the increase is also attributable to a increase in non interest income  as service charge income and other fees provided recurring sources of income 
our return on average equity was for the period ended december  we have been able to achieve this level without relying on a disproportionate share of income from mortgage banking operations 
our improvement has occurred as we have continued to grow through the opening of new branches 
our efficiency ratio has also increased during this growth in the past year  rising from at december  to for year end critical accounting policies general the financial condition and results of operations presented in the consolidated financial statements  the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and this section are  to a large degree  dependent upon our accounting policies 
the selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
we discuss below those accounting policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies require our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting sfas  accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimatable and sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
our allowance for loan losses is determined by evaluating our loan portfolio on at least a quarterly basis 
particular attention is paid to individual loan performance  collateral values  borrower financial condition and overall economic conditions 
the evaluation includes a close review of the internal watch list and other non performing loans 
management uses three steps in calculating the balance of the allowance 
the first step is the specific classification which examines problem loans and applies a weight factor to each category 
the weight factor is based upon historical data and the loans within each category are reviewed on a monthly basis to determine changes in their status 
the second step applies a predetermined rate against total loans with unspecified reserves 
again  this rate is based upon experience and can change over time 
the third step is an unallocated allowance which is determined by economic events and conditions that may have a real  but as yet undetermined  impact upon the portfolio 
each of these steps is based on data that can be subjective and the actual losses may be greater or less than the amount of the allowance 
however  management feels that the allowance represents a reasonable assessment of the risk imbedded in the portfolio 
other real estate owned foreclosed properties are recorded at the lower of the outstanding loan balance at the time of foreclosure or the estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell 
at foreclosure any excess of the loan balance over the fair value of the property is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
such carrying value is periodically reevaluated and written down if there is an indicated decline in fair value  such as an independent appraisal 
historically  foreclosed properties are not carried on the books for more than two or three fiscal quarters  so the incidence of this happening is generally rare 
costs to bring a property to salable condition are capitalized up to the fair value of the property while costs to maintain a property in salable condition are expensed as incurred 
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the balance sheet method 
under this method  the net deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the tax effects of the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the various balance sheet assets and liabilities and gives current recognition to changes in tax rates and laws 
when calculating deferred tax assets  we are making the assumption that the corporation will continue to have taxable income  as opposed to losses 
we are also assuming that the corporation will continue to be assessed at the current rate of financial condition total assets the corporation s assets grew at a pace  ending the year at million 
total loans at year end  were million of which million were loans secured by real estate 
the remaining loans consisted of million in commercial loans  million in consumer installment loans and million in all other loans 
net loans for  were million  an increase of million or from the december  balance of million 
the loan to deposit ratio was for and as of december  steady loan demand in an expanding market  combined with continued low interest rates for the first three quarters of the year  generated the loan growth experienced for these conditions  along with the strong valley economy  combined with the growth realized from the new loan production office in martinsburg  west virginia  gives management the belief that the corporation will continue to see strong and increased loan demand for the immediate future 
the investment portfolio increased to million at year end compared to million at december  federal funds sold increased million to million at december  compared to million at december  total interest earning assets increased million or from december  to december  this increase was primarily the result of the increase in outstanding loan balances 
liabilities total deposits increased to million at december   from a balance of million at december   which is an increase of million or 
non interest bearing deposits have increased to million as of december   an increase of million or from year end during this period interest bearing checking and savings accounts increased million or to million

net income net income for the year ended was million compared to million for the same period in this is an increase of million or over the same period the provision for income tax expense increased thousand from million in to million in the return on assets was for as compared to for the same period for  the return on equity was down from for net income for the year ended was million compared to million for the same period in this is an increase of thousand or over the same period the return on assets was for as compared to for the same period for  the return on equity was up from for net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense and represents our gross profit margin 
the net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average earning assets 
it reflects the average effective rate that we earned on our earning assets 
net interest margin is affected by changes in both average interest rates and average volumes of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income for the year ending december  was million  million or higher than the year ending this increase is the result of the growth in average earning assets of million in the combination of growth and rate changes had the effect of increasing the net interest margin from at year end to for the same period of as is the case with most financial institutions  premier is liability sensitive for interest bearing balances re pricing or maturing within one year 
net interest income for the year ended december  was million  million or higher than the year ended december  this increase is the result of the growth in average earning assets of million in the combination of growth and rate changes had the effect of decreasing the net interest margin from at year end to for the same period of interest income totaled million for the year ended december   million or higher than the year ending december  interest and fees on loans of million  which was an increase of over the million in interest and fees on loans recognized in  comprised the vast majority of interest income 
interest income from investment securities was million for  virtually unchanged from the year end amount of million 
interest income on federal funds  the third major component of the bank s investments  increased thousand or 
interest income totaled million for the year ended december   million or higher than the year ended december  interest and fees on loans of million comprised the vast majority of interest income 
interest income from investment securities was million for  down slightly from the year end amount of million 
this slight decrease was due to the decreased balance in the investment portfolio at december  interest income on federal funds sold decreased thousand or 
the decline in interest earned on federal funds balances was the result of a decrease in the interest rate paid on fed funds during total interest expense for the year ended december  was million  thousand or higher than the year ending interest paid on deposits for increased by thousand or over the same period although interest rates remained at or near record lows during the first three quarters of  the additional expense was generated by an increase of million in total deposits during the year 
interest on borrowings increased by thousand or over the same period last year 
this increase was primarily the result of interest expense related to the additional borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
total interest expense for the year ended december  was million  thousand or lower than for the same period interest paid on deposits for decreased by thousand or over the same period the impact of declining interest rates from december through december more than offset the additional expense generated by an increase of million in total deposits during the same period 
interest on borrowings increased by thousand or over the same period this increase was primarily the result of additional interest expense related to the issuance of a trust preferred issue of million during borrowings were also obtained from the federal home loan bank

the average life of mortgage loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of loan prepayments and enforcement of due on sale clauses  which gives us the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
in addition  certain borrowers increase their equity in the security property by making payments in excess of those required under the terms of the mortgage 
non interest income our non interest income is derived chiefly from service charges on deposit accounts  including charges for non sufficient funds and atm fees  and commissions and fees from bank services  such as mortgage originations and debit and credit card processing

net loans were million at december   an increase of over december we have significant concentrations of credit in the land acquisition and land development and construction due to the current growth and other economic development that we have been experiencing in our market area for the last several years 
at december   we had million of commercial loans secured by real estate  which represented of gross loans at that date 
in addition  at december   we had million of construction and land development loans secured by real estate  which represented of gross loans at that date

banking regulations require institutions to classify their own assets and to establish prudent general allowances for losses for assets classified as substandard or doubtful 
for the portion of assets classified as loss  an institution is required to either establish specific allowances of of the amount classified or charge such amounts off its books 
the accrual of interest on mortgage and commercial loans is discontinued at the time the loan is days delinquent unless the credit is well secured and in process of collection 
we place loans on non accrual status at an earlier date  or we charge them off  if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful 
all interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on non accrual or charged off is reversed against interest income 
the interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash basis or cost recovery method  until they qualify for a return to accrual status 
loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured 
allowance for loan losses we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a sufficient level to provide for potential losses in the loan portfolio 
loan losses are charged directly to the allowance when they occur  while recoveries are credited to the allowance 
specific reserves by loan type are established based on overall historical losses  anticipated losses  and inherit risk 
additionally  specific reserves for individual loans are established depending on the severity of the potential loss 
loans are individually reserved once classified as a watch item by management 
a higher percentage of the loan is reserved for individual loans with a more severe classification 
the adequacy of the provision for loan losses is reviewed regularly by management through consideration of several factors including changes in character and size of the loan portfolio and related loan loss experience  a review and examination of overall loan quality whic h includes the identification and assessment of problem loans and an analysis of anticipated economic conditions in the market area 
the allowance for loan losses  at december   was million 
this is an increase of thousand or from december  the increases in our allowance for loan losses are the result of adjustments that management has made in response to the growth of our loan portfolio

the corporation s management and board of directors have reviewed the asset quality of marathon s and rockingham heritage s loan portfolios and both loan loss allowances and have found them to be adequate 
the following table details information concerning non accrual loans  foreclosed properties and past due loans at december for each of the years indicated december  in s non accrual loans foreclosed properties loans past due days or more and still accruing interest sources of funds deposits we primarily use deposits to fund our loans and investment securities 
we offer individuals and small to medium size businesses a variety of deposit accounts 
deposit accounts  including checking  savings  money markets and certificates of deposit  are obtained primarily from the communities we serve 
we attract both short term and long term deposits from the general public by offering a wide assortment of accounts and rates 
we offer statement savings accounts  various checking accounts  various money market accounts  fixed rate certificates with varying maturities and individual retirement accounts 
at december   deposits were million  an increase of from million at december  the deposit growth is a reflection of branch office growth  aggressive pricing  increased marketing and bank consolidation in our principal market 
in order to reduce the overall cost of funds and reduce our reliance on high cost time deposits and short term borrowings as a funding source  we continue to direct marketing efforts towards attracting lower cost transaction accounts 
however  there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful  or if successful  will reduce our reliance on time deposits and short term borrowings

further  the corporation does bid for selected public funds deposits in large denominations  and such deposits may require a pledging of investment securities 
the corporation competes with the major regional financial institutions for money market accounts and certificates of deposits less than  while the corporation is competitive with its interest rates  using a tiered rate system to increase individual account balances  the corporation has found that it can continue to maintain a higher interest margin than its peers by matching loan maturities with certificate maturities and setting loan rates based on the corporation s cost of funds 
liquidity and capital reserves liquidity is a measure of our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet present and future obligations in a timely manner 
our liquidity requirements are measured by the need to meet deposit withdrawals  fund loans  meet reserve requirements and maintain cash levels necessary for daily operations 
to meet liquidity requirements  we maintain cash reserves and have an adequate flow of funds from maturing loans  securities  and short term investments 
in addition  our banks have the ability to borrow additional funds from various sources 
short term borrowings are available from federal funds facilities at correspondent banks and from the discount window of the federal reserve bank 
borrowings are available from the federal home loan bank 
we consider our sources of liquidity to be ample to meet our estimated needs 
our ability to fund these daily commitments at december   and is illustrated in the table below december  amounts in s liquid assets cash and due from banks federal funds sold liquid securities loans maturing in one year or less total liquid assets total deposits and other liabilities ratio of liquid assets to deposits and other liabilities the net loan to deposit ratio as of december  has provided the opportunity for the corporation to achieve a high return on its deposits 
for the year ended december   the corporation experienced a return on assets of and a net interest margin of 
typically  management prefers to maintain a loan to deposit ratio of less than 
the high rate of growth in new loans being produced by the loan production office in martinsburg  west virginia  an office that cannot offer deposit products until it is established as a separate bank is the primary reason for the corporation s higher than usual loan to deposit ratio 
due to the anticipated deposit growth once premier bank has been established  and in light of the short term borrowings available to the corporation  management does not feel that this represents a liquidity problem  and we anticipate that the loan to deposit ratio will be back within normal ranges during the source of new funds is strong for both long term and short term duration 
the growth in deposits was million or during the corporation also has access to overnight federal funds from correspondent banks totaling up to million 
in addition  the corporation has established borrowing limits through the federal reserve bank s discount window for million 
also  the corporation has million of funds available through the federal home loan bank of atlanta of which million has been utilized

these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit and commercial lines of credit 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
the corporation s exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments

 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation provides guidance with respect to the identification of variable interest entities when the assets  liabilities  non controlling interests  and results of operations of a variable interest entity need to be included in a corporation s consolidated financial statements 
an entity is deemed a variable interest entity  subject to the interpretation  if the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  or in cases in which the equity investors lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest  which include the ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting rights  the obligations to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur  or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
due to significant implementation issues  the fasb modified the wording of fin and issued fin r in december of finr deferred the effective date for the provisions of fin to entities other than special purpose entities spes until financial statements issued for periods ending after march  spes were subject to the provisions of either fin or fin r as of december  management has evaluated the corporation s investments in variable interest entities and potential variable interest entities or transactions  particularly in limited liability partnerships involved in low income housing development and trust preferred securities structures because these entities or transactions constitute the corporation s primary fin and fin r exposure 
the adoption of fin and fin r did not have a material effect on the corporation s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
in december  the accounting standards executive committee acsec of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
the sop is effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  the scope of the sop applies to unhealthy problem loans that have been acquired  either individually in a portfolio  or in a business acquisition 
the sop addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor s initial investment in loans or debt securities loans acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality

the guidance requires that investments which have declined in value due to credit concerns or solely due to changes in interest rates must be recorded as other than temporarily impaired unless the corporation can assert and demonstrate its intention to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery of fair value up to or beyond the cost of the investment which might mean maturity 
this issue also requires disclosures assessing the ability and intent to hold investments in instances in which an investor determines that an investment with a fair value less than cost is not other than temporarily impaired 
on september   the financial accounting standards board decided to delay the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in issue this delay does not suspend the requirement to recognize other than temporary impairments as required by existing authoritative literature 
the disclosure guidance in issue was not delayed 
eitf no 
 accounting for investments in limited liability companies was ratified by the board and is effective for reporting periods beginning after june  apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting investments in common stock  prescribes the accounting for investments in common stock of corporations that are not consolidated 
aicpa accounting interpretation  investments in partnerships ventures  of opinion  indicates that many of the provisions of the opinion would be appropriate in accounting for partnerships 
in eitf abstracts  topic no 
d  accounting for limited partnership investments  the sec staff clarified its view that investments of more than to percent are considered to be more than minor and  therefore  should be accounted for using the equity method 
limited liability companies llcs have characteristics of both characteristics of both corporations and partnerships  but are dissimilar from both in certain respects 
due to those similarities and differences  diversity in practice exists with respect to accounting for non controlling investments in llcs 
the consensus reached was that an llc should be viewed as similar to a corporation or similar to a partnership for purposes of determining whether a non controlling investment should be accounted for using the cost method or the equity method of accounting 
we do not expect that implementation will have a significant impact on the financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
the statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
the statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
the entity will initially measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of liability instruments based on its current fair value  the fair value of that award will be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date 
changes in fair value during the requisite service period will be recognized as compensation cost over that period 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments unless observable market prices for the same or similar instruments are available 
if an equity award is modified after the grant date  incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification 
this statement is effective for public entities that do not file as small business issuers as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  under the transition method  compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under statement for either recognition or pro forma disclosures 
for periods before the required effective date  entities may elect to apply a modified version of retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by statement item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general an important element of both earnings performance and liquidity is the management of our interest sensitive assets and our interest sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within specific time intervals and the risks involved with them 
market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
our market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
the asset and liability management committee at each bank is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to this risk 
our board of directors reviews the guidelines established by each committee 
interest rate risk is monitored through the use of three complimentary modeling tools static gap analysis  earnings simulation modeling and economic value simulation net present value estimation 
each of these models measures changes in a variety of interest rate scenarios 
while each of the interest rate risk measures has limitations  taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of our interest rate risk  the distribution of risk along the yield curve  the level of risk through time  and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
static gap  which measures aggregate repricing values  is less utilized since it does not effectively measure the earnings impact on us 
earnings simulation and economic value models  however  which more effectively reflect the earnings impact  are utilized by management on a regular basis 
earnings simulation analysis we use simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of net income to changes in interest rates 
the model calculates an earnings estimate based on current and projected balances and rates 
this method is subject to the accuracy of the assumptions that underlie the process  but it provides a better analysis of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates than other analysis such as the static gap analysis 
assumptions used in the model  including loan and deposit growth rates  are derived from seasonal trends and management s outlook  as are the assumptions used to project the yields and rates for new loans and deposits 
all maturities  calls and prepayments in the securities portfolio are assumed to be reinvested in like instruments 
mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities prepayment assumptions are based on industry estimates of prepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning 
different interest rate scenarios and yield curves are used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to changing interest rates 
interest rates on different asset and liability accounts move differently when the prime rate changes and are accounted for in the different rate scenarios 
the following table represents the interest rate sensitivity on our net income using different rate scenarios as of december  change in change in prime rate net income basis points basis points basis points most likely basis points basis points basis points economic value simulation we use economic value simulation to calculate the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities over different interest rate environments 
economic values are calculated based on discounted cash flow analysis 
the economic value of equity is the economic value of all assets minus the economic value of all liabilities 
the change in economic value of equity over different rate environments is an indication of the longer term repricing risk in the balance sheet 
the same assumptions are used in the economic value simulation as in the earnings simulation 
the following chart reflects the change in net market value by using december  data  over different rate environments with a one year horizon 
change in economic value of equity change in prime rate dollars in thousands basis points basis points basis points most likely basis points basis points basis points management of the interest sensitivity gap the interest sensitivity gap is the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time interval 
the gap can be managed by repricing assets or liabilities  by selling investments  by replacing an asset or liability prior to maturity  or by adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
matching the amounts of assets and liabilities repricing in the same time interval helps to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net income due to changes in market interest rates 
we evaluate interest rate risk and then formulate guidelines regarding asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing  and off balance sheet commitments in order to decrease sensitivity risk 
these guidelines are based upon management s outlook regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the regional and national economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
our asset and liability committees review deposit pricing  changes in borrowed money  investment and trading activity  loan sale activities  liquidity levels and the overall interest sensitivity 
the actions of the committees are reported to the boards of directors regularly monthly by marathon and quarterly by rockingham heritage 
the daily monitoring of interest rate risk  investment and trading activity  along with any other significant transactions are managed by the presidents of each bank with input from other committee members
