this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including but not limited to those under the heading factors that may affect our future performance 
regulation g  conditions for use of non gaap financial measures  and other provisions of the securities exchange act of  as amended  define and prescribe the conditions for the use of certain non gaap financial information 
in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we provide information regarding growth in product revenues excluding recently acquired product lines  which is a non gaap financial measure 
a reconciliation of this non gaap financial measure to the most comparable gaap measure is provided in this annual report 
this non gaap financial measure should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures 
management believes that this non gaap financial measure constitutes important supplemental information to investors which reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that  when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliations  provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our ongoing business and operations 
management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirely and to not rely on any single financial measure 
because non gaap financial measures are not standardized  it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies non gaap financial measures having the same or similar names 
general integra develops  manufactures and markets medical devices for use in neuro trauma  neurosurgery  reconstructive surgery and general surgery 
our business is organized into product groups and distribution channels 
our product groups include implants and other devices for use in surgical procedures  monitoring systems for the measurement of various parameters in tissue such as pressure  temperature and oxygen  hand held and ultrasonic surgical instruments  and private label products that we manufacture for other medical device companies 
our distribution channels include three sales organizations in the united states one that we employ to call on neurosurgeons known as our integra neurosciences tm sales organization  another employed to call on reconstructive surgeons and a third group that utilizes a network of third party distributors 
internationally  we combine resources across different sales channels in some cases with direct sales organizations in france  germany  the united kingdom and the benelux region 
outside of these areas  we operate through a number of distributors that sell our products in over countries 
we invest substantial resources and management effort to develop our sales organizations  and we believe that we compete very effectively in this aspect of our business 
we distribute private label products through strategic alliances 
we manufacture most of the implant  monitoring and private label products that we sell in various plants located in the united states  puerto rico  france  the united kingdom and germany 
we also manufacture the ultrasonic surgical instruments and source most of our hand held surgical instruments through specialized third party vendors 
we believe that we have a particular advantage in the development  manufacture and sale of specialty tissue repair products derived from bovine collagen 
we develop and build these products in our manufacturing facility in plainsboro  new jersey 
taken together  these products accounted for approximately  and of product revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we manage these multiple product groups and distribution channels on a centralized basis 
accordingly  we report our financial results under a single operating segment the development  manufacturing and distribution of medical devices 
our objective is to build a customer focused and profitable medical device company by developing or acquiring innovative medical devices and other products to sell through our sales channels 
our strategy therefore entails substantial growth in product revenues both through internal means through launching new and innovative products and selling existing products more intensively and by acquiring existing businesses or already successful product lines 
we aim to achieve this growth in revenues while maintaining strong financial results 
while we pay attention to any meaningful trend in our financial results  we pay particular attention to measurements that tend to support the view that our profitability can grow for a period of years 
these measurements include revenue growth  derived through acquisitions and products developed internally  gross margins on products revenues  which we hope to increase to more than over a period of several years  operating margins  which we hope to continually expand on as we leverage our existing infrastructure  and earnings per fully diluted share of common stock 
acquisitions our strategy for growing our business includes the acquisition of complementary product lines and companies 
our recent acquisitions of businesses  assets and product lines may make our financial results for the year ended december  not directly comparable to those of the corresponding prior year periods

jamner surgical instruments  inc doing business as jarit r surgical instruments for million in cash 
jarit sells its products to more than  hospitals and surgery centers worldwide 
jarit generates its domestic product sales primarily through sales to hospitals that are members of group purchasing organizations 
group purchasing organizations use the combined leverage of their member hospitals to obtain better prices for medical products for the participating hospitals and other health care providers than might otherwise be available to these institutions individually 
the acquisition of jarit broadened our customer base and surgical instrument product offering and facilitated the procurement of our ruggles tm and padgett instrument products directly from the instrument manufacturers

in july  we acquired the assets of signature technologies  inc  a specialty manufacturer of titanium and stainless steel implants for the neurosurgical and spinal markets  and certain other intellectual property assets 
the purchase price consisted of million in cash  million of deferred consideration and royalties on future sales of products to be developed 
our acquisition of signature technologies gave us the capability of developing and manufacturing metal implants for our strategic partners and for our direct sale organizations 
through june  signature technologies manufactured cranial fixation systems for sale primarily under a single contract manufacturing agreement 
in december  we consolidated the signature manufacturing operation into our cincinnati  ohio facility 
in november  we agreed to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of newdeal technologies for million euros in cash  subject to certain adjustments 
the acquisition closed on january  based in lyon  france  newdeal is a leading developer and marketer of specialty implants and instruments specifically designed for foot and ankle surgery 
the company sells its products through a direct sales force in france  belgium and the netherlands and through distributors in more than countries  including the united states and canada 
results of operations net income in was million  or per diluted share  as compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in and net income of million  or per diluted share  in included in these amounts are certain revenues  charges or gains resulting from facts and circumstances that  based on our recent history and future expectations  may not recur with similar materiality or impact on continuing operations 
we believe that the identification of all revenues  charges and gains that meet these criteria promotes comparability of reported financial results 
the following revenues  charges and gains were included in net income and net income per diluted share in we recorded a million charge in connection with the milestone payment related to the completion of certain development activities related to the neurosenor r cerebral blood flow monitoring system and a million licensing fee paid for the development of a data acquisition system to support the integration of our advanced monitoring products 
we recorded a million share based compensation charge associated with the renewal of our president and chief executive officer s employment agreement 
we recorded a million tax charge incurred in connection with the reorganization of certain european operations 
we recognized million of other income related to an unrealized gain on a foreign currency collar  which was used to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar as a result of our commitment to acquire newdeal technologies for million euros 
the newdeal technologies acquisition was completed in january in we recorded million of other revenue related to the acceleration of the recognition of unused minimum purchase payments and unamortized license fee revenue from ethicon following the termination of the supply  distribution and collaboration agreement in december we incurred million of expenses related to the closing of our san diego research center  consolidation of the research activities into our other facilities and the discontinuation of certain research programs 
we recorded an acquired in process research and development charge of  in connection with an acquisition 
we made a million donation to the integra foundation  which is included in general and administrative expenses 
we received a million payment from ethicon from the termination of our agreement with them  which is included in other income 
in we recorded a million deferred income tax benefit primarily from the reduction of the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carryforwards 
we recorded acquired in process research and development charges of million in connection with acquisitions 
total revenues and gross margin on product revenues in thousands  except per share data monitoring products    implant products    instruments    private label products    total product revenues    other revenue    total revenues    cost of product revenues    gross margin on product revenues    gross margin as a percentage of product revenues in  total revenues increased over to million  led by a million  or  increase in product revenues to million 
domestic product revenues increased million in to million  or of total product revenues  as compared to of product revenues in and sales of instruments and implant products  which reported a and increase  respectively  in sales over  led our growth in product revenues in in  total revenues increased over to million  led by a increase in product revenues to million 
domestic product revenues increased million in to million 
sales of instruments and implant products  which reported a and increase  respectively  in sales over  led our growth in product revenues in reported product revenues for and included the following amounts in revenues from acquired product lines revenues revenues change in thousands total product revenues products acquired during 
 n a products acquired during 
  all other product revenues   total product revenues   product revenues excluding and acquisitions grew at for the year ended december  as compared to increased sales of our duragen r dural graft matrix and integra r dermal regeneration template product families as well as an increase in our absorbable collagen sponge product sold to wyeth biopharma accounted for a significant portion of this growth 
our revenue growth in over  excluding acquisitions  was driven by our duragen r dural graft matrix  neuragen tm nerve guide  intracranial monitoring and drainage systems  and neurosurgical systems products 
all of the products acquired in and were added to the instrument product group 
in  we launched several new products under the duragen r dural graft matrix and integra r dermal regeneration template product families 
however  we expect growing competition in the area of absorbable implant technology products  which could affect growth in our product lines 
we continue to broaden our product offerings using our proprietary absorbable implant technology by developing products that meet the additional needs of surgeons within the markets we serve 
our acquisition in january of the newdeal foot and angle implant product lines gives us additional opportunities to expand the use of our absorbable implant products into additional areas within the surgical reconstructive market 
we have generated our product revenue growth through acquisitions  new product launches and increased direct sales and marketing efforts both domestically and in europe 
we expect that our future growth will derive from our expanded domestic sales force  the continued implementation of our direct sales strategy in europe and from internally developed and acquired products 
we also intend to continue to acquire businesses that complement our existing businesses and products 
gross margin as a percentage of product revenues was in  in and in cost of product revenues included   and  in fair value inventory purchase accounting adjustments recorded in connection with acquisitions in  and  respectively 
product gross margins improved in as a result of increased sales of higher margin products  including the effect of selling our integra r dermal regeneration products directly  as well as the contribution of the mayfield product line we acquired in during  the gross margin was negatively affected by fair value inventory purchase accounting adjustments and from the acquisition of lower margin products 
the impact of foreign exchange rates on the cost of products that we manufacture or purchase in europe negatively affected gross margins in and we expect our future gross margins to continue to benefit as our higher margin products continue to grow faster than other products and as we continue to increase sales of our products in foreign currencies 
we currently do not hedge our exposure to operating foreign currency risk 
in and  the cost of products we manufacture or purchase in europe exceeded our foreign currency denominated revenues 
we expect this imbalance to continue into a further weakening of the dollar against the euro and british pound could negatively affect future gross margins 
other revenue has historically consisted of research and development funding from strategic partners and government grants  and license  distribution  and other event related revenues from strategic partners and other third parties 
in  our other revenue included million of revenues derived from an agreement with ethicon that was terminated in december we do not expect to generate significant revenues in the future from these types of arrangements 
other operating expenses the following is a summary of other operating expenses as a percent of total revenues research and development selling  general and administrative research and development costs have continued to decline as percentage of total revenue as we continue to restructure our research and development activities 
the percentage declines are also the result of significant increases in hand held instrument sales  which by their nature require less research and development expenditures compared to our other product lines 
our research and development expenses increased million to million and included a million milestone payment related to the completion of certain development activities for an advanced neuromonitoring system and a million licensing fee paid for the development of a data acquisition system to support the integration of our advanced monitoring products 
in we incurred  of expenses related to the consolidation of our san diego research center with our other facilities 
we also reported in process research and development charges of  and million in and  respectively 
in  we expect our research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues to remain consistent with as we increase expenditures on research and clinical activities directed towards expanding the indications for use of our absorbable implant technology products  including a multi center clinical trial suitable to support an application to the fda for approval of the duragen plus tm adhesion barrier matrix product in the united states 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased significantly in and included a stock based compensation charge of million related to the renewal of our president and chief executive officer s employment agreement 
this stock based compensation charge represented of total revenues 
we reported significant increases in sales and marketing expenditures as we continue to build our direct sales and marketing organizations around all three direct selling platforms 
sales and marketing increases included additional personnel costs  additional trade show activities as well as costs related to acquired product lines 
we made significant investments in our infrastructure with the implementation of a new enterprise business system and the relocation and expansion of our distribution capabilities through a third party service provider 
we also incurred a significant increase in professional fees associated with compliance with new internal controls compliance and reporting 
in  increases in spending included sales support for jarit instrument sales and the expansion of the reconstructive sales force in anticipation of the termination of the ethicon agreement 
we also hired more experienced marketing professionals and spent more on advertising 
in addition  in we donated million to the integra foundation and incurred additional costs to consolidate several facilities 
in  we expect our selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue will return to the and range 
amortization expense increased to million in because of amortization on intangible assets acquired through our business acquisitions 
including the expected impact of intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of newdeal in january  we expect annual amortization expense to be approximately million in  million in  million in  million in and million in non operating income and expenses in march and april  we received approximately million of net proceeds from the sale of million of our contingent convertible subordinated notes due in march in and  we recorded interest expense of million and million  respectively  in connection with these notes  which was offset by million and million  respectively of interest income on our invested cash and marketable debt securities 
we will pay additional interest contingent interest on our convertible notes if  at thirty days prior to maturity  our common stock price is greater than per share 
we recorded a  liability related to the estimated fair value of the contingent interest obligation at the time the notes were issued 
the fair value of this contingent interest obligation is marked to its fair value at each balance sheet date  with changes in the fair value recorded to interest expense 
at december  and  the estimated fair value of the contingent interest obligation was  and  respectively 
in august  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a million notional amount to hedge the risk of changes in fair value attributable to interest rate risk with respect to a portion of our fixed rate convertible notes 
we receive a fixed rate from the counterparty  payable on a semi annual basis  and pay to the counterparty a floating rate based on month libor minus basis points  payable on a quarterly basis 
the interest rate swap agreement terminates in march  subject to early termination upon the occurrence of certain events  including redemption or conversion of the convertible notes 
the interest rate swap agreement qualifies as a fair value hedge under sfas no 
 as amended accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the net amount to be paid or received under the interest rate swap agreement is recorded as a component of interest expense 
interest expense for the years ended december  and  respectively  reflects a  and  reduction associated with the interest rate swap 
the net fair value of the interest rate swap at inception was  in and  the net fair value of the interest rate swap increased  to million and  to million  respectively 
in connection with this fair value hedge  we recorded in and a  and  respectively  net decrease in the carrying value of our contingent convertible notes 
the  and  net difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap and the contingent convertible notes represents the ineffective portion of the hedging relationship  and these amounts are recorded in other income expense  net 
our net other income expense declined in by  to million as a result of an increase in foreign currency transaction gains  including a million unrealized gain associated with the foreign currency collar in  offset by the decline of million from the termination payment received from ethicon in income taxes since  we have generated positive taxable income on a cumulative basis 
in light of this trend  our projections for future taxable earnings and the expected timing of the reversal of deductible temporary differences  in  we reduced the remaining valuation allowance recorded against our net operating loss carryforwards by million  which reflected our estimate of additional tax benefits that we expected to realize in the future 
a valuation allowance of million is recorded against the remaining million of net deferred tax assets recorded at december  this valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for certain expenses which will be deductible for tax purposes in very limited circumstances and for which we believe it is unlikely that we will recognize the associated tax benefit 
we do not anticipate additional income tax benefits through future reductions in the valuation allowance 
however  if we determine that we would be able to realize more or less than the recorded amount of net deferred tax assets  we will record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the period such a determination is made 
in  our effective income tax rate was of income before income taxes compared to in our rate includes a million tax charge related to the transfer of certain intangible assets 
we recorded a net income tax benefit in related to the reduction of deferred tax asset valuation allowances previously recorded 
the net decrease in our tax asset valuation allowance was million and million in and  respectively 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively  to offset future taxable income 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire through and  respectively 
at december   several of our subsidiaries had unused net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards arising from periods prior to our ownership which expire through the internal revenue code limits the timing and manner in which we may use any acquired net operating losses or tax credits 
the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law in october and has several provisions that may impact our income taxes in the future  including the repeal of the extraterritorial income exclusion and a deduction related to qualified production activities taxable income 
the financial accounting standards board fasb proposed that the qualified production activities deduction is a special deduction and will have no impact on deferred taxes existing at the enactment date 
rather  the impact of this deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on our tax return 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the fasb guidance related to qualified production activities on our effective tax rate in future periods 
international product revenues and operations product revenues by major geographic area are summarized below united asia other states europe pacific foreign consolidated in thousands in  revenues from customers outside the united states totaled million  or of consolidated product revenues  of which approximately were to european customers 
revenues from customers outside the united states included million of revenues generated in foreign currencies 
in  product revenues from customers outside the united states totaled million  or of consolidated product revenues  of which approximately were to european customers 
revenues from customers outside the united states included million of revenues generated in foreign currencies 
in  product revenues from customers outside the united states totaled million  or of consolidated product revenues  of which approximately were to european customers 
revenues from customers outside the united states included million of revenues generated in foreign currencies 
because we have operations based in europe and we generate revenues and incur operating expenses in euros and british pounds  we will experience currency exchange risk with respect to those foreign currency denominated revenues or expenses 
in  the cost of products we manufactured in our european facilities or purchased in foreign currencies exceeded our foreign currency denominated revenues 
we expect this imbalance to continue into we currently do not hedge our exposure to operating foreign currency risk 
accordingly  a further weakening of the dollar against the euro and british pound could negatively affect future gross margins and operating margins 
we will continue to assess the potential effects that changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on our business 
if we believe this potential impact presents a significant risk to our business  we may enter into derivative financial instruments to mitigate this risk 
additionally  we generate significant revenues outside the united states  a portion of which are us dollar denominated transactions conducted with customers who generate revenue in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the currencies in which those customers do business may have an impact on the demand for our products in foreign countries 
our sales to foreign markets may be affected by local economic conditions  regulatory or political considerations  the effectiveness of our sales representatives and distributors  local competition and changes in local medical practice 
relationships with customers and effective terms of sale frequently vary by country  often with longer term receivables than are typical in the united states 
liquidity and capital resources cash and marketable securities at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million 
investments consist almost entirely of highly liquid  interest bearing debt securities 
cash flows we generated positive operating cash flows of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
operating cash flows continued to improve primarily as a result of higher pre tax income adjusted for the add back of non cash items and the benefits from the continued utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax deductions generated by employee stock option exercises 
included in the operating cash flow was a million use of cash related to changes in working capital items 
a significant increase in accounts receivable and inventory was primarily due to the overall growth in the business and delays in customer collections related to business systems transitions 
we expect our days on hand in accounts receivable and inventory to return to historic trend levels during based on our current unused net operating loss carryforward position and various other future potential tax deductions  we expect our operating cash flows to continue to benefit from actual cash tax payments being lower than our effective book income tax rate for at least the next two years 
in  we used million to repurchase  shares of our common stock  which was partially offset by million in cash flows generated from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
other principal uses of funds in were million for acquisitions and million in purchases in property and equipment 
the million increase in purchases of property and equipment in was primarily related to our procurement and implementation of our new enterprise business software 
we had positive cash flows of million from the net sales and maturities of marketable debt securities 
in  we generated million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans and million of net proceeds from the sale of million of our contingent convertible subordinated notes 
we had uses of funds of million for acquisitions  million for the net purchases of marketable debt securities  million for the repurchase of approximately million shares our common stock and million for capital expenditures 
the significant repurchase of our common stock in was made simultaneously with the issuance of our convertible notes 
in  our principal sources of funds were million of operating cash flow and million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
in  our principal uses of funds were million for acquisitions  the repayment of a million note and million for capital expenditures 
working capital at december  and  working capital was million and million  respectively 
the increase in working capital in was primarily due to increases in inventory to support our growth in product revenues  higher accounts receivable balances related to increased sales and delays in customer collections 
both items were also affected by our transition to our new enterprise business system in the second half of the year 
we expect our days on hand in accounts receivable and inventory to return to historic trend levels during the december  amount includes the funds subsequently used on january  to purchase newdeal technologies  as discussed below 
convertible debt and related hedging activities in  we generated million of net proceeds from the sale of million of our contingent convertible subordinated notes due in march we pay interest on the convertible notes at an annual rate of each september th and march th 
we will also pay contingent interest on the notes if  at thirty days prior to maturity  our common stock price is greater than 
the contingent interest will be payable for each of the last three years the notes remain outstanding in an amount equal to the greater of of the face amount of the notes and the amount of regular cash dividends paid during each such year on the number of shares of common stock into which each note is convertible 
holders of the notes may convert the notes into shares of our common stock under certain circumstances  including when the market price of our common stock on the previous trading day is more than per share  based on an initial conversion price of per share 
the notes are general  unsecured obligations of integra and will be subordinate to any future senior indebtedness 
we cannot redeem the notes prior to their maturity  and the notes holders may compel us to repurchase the notes upon a change of control 
there are no financial covenants associated with the convertible notes 
in august  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a million notional amount to hedge the risk of changes in fair value attributable to interest rate risk with respect to a portion of the notes 
we receive a fixed rate from the counterparty  payable on a semi annual basis  and pay to the counterparty a floating rate based on month libor minus basis points  payable on a quarterly basis 
the interest rate swap agreement terminates in march  subject to early termination upon the occurrence of certain events  including redemption or conversion of the contingent convertible notes 
our effective interest rate on the hedged portion of the notes was as of december  share repurchase plans during  and  we repurchased approximately  million and  shares  respectively  of our common stock under authorized share repurchase programs 
dividend policy we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock since our formation 
any future determinations to pay cash dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors 
requirements and capital resources we believe that our cash and marketable securities are sufficient to finance our operations and capital expenditures in the near term 
in january  we used million in cash to complete the acquisition of newdeal technologies 
we also expect to invest approximately million in associated with the continued worldwide implementation of our new enterprise business software 
given the significant level of liquid assets and our objective to grow by acquisition and alliances  our financial position could change significantly if we were to complete a business acquisition by utilizing a significant portion of our liquid assets 
currently  we do not have any existing borrowing capacity or other credit facilities in place to raise significant amounts of capital if such a need arises 
contractual obligations and commitments as of december   we were obligated to pay the following amounts under various agreements less than more than total year years years years in millions long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases purchase obligations pension contributions other long term liabilities 
total in addition  under other agreements we are required to make payments based on sales levels of certain products or if specific development milestones are achieved 
the above table does not include contingent interest that we may be obligated to pay on our contingent convertible subordinated notes due in march see non operating income and expenses 
in november  we agreed to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of newdeal technologies for million euros in cash  subject to certain adjustments 
the acquisition closed on january  the above table does not include the amount we paid at the closing of this transaction on january  and does not include the obligation to pay up to million euros plus a working capital adjustment that we may be obligated to pay under the newdeal acquisition agreement on january  as a post closing payment 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
significant estimates affecting amounts reported or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements include allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and sales returns  net realizable value of inventories  estimates of future cash flows associated with acquired in process research and development charges  fair market value of derivative instruments  amortization periods for acquired intangible assets  and loss contingencies 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the current circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies  which form the basis for developing these estimates  are those that are most critical to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations to us  we record an allowance against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount that we reasonably expect to collect 
for all other customers  we record allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of customers or the length of time that receivables are past due were to change  we may change the recorded amount of allowances for doubtful accounts in the future 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product revenues in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on historical sales returns and other known factors 
actual returns could be different from our estimates and the related provisions for sales returns and allowances  resulting in future changes to the sales returns and allowances provision 
inventories inventories  consisting of purchased materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost  the value determined by the first in  first out method  or market 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate ending inventories for excess quantities  obsolescence or shelf life expiration 
our evaluation includes an analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand 
to the extent that we determine there are excess  obsolete or expired inventory quantities  we record valuation reserves against all or a portion of the value of the related products 
if future demand or market conditions are different than our projections  a change in recorded inventory valuation reserves may be required and would be reflected in cost of revenues in the period the revision is made 
derivatives we report all derivatives at their estimated fair value and record changes in fair value in current earnings or defer these changes until a related hedged item is recognized in earnings  depending on the nature and effectiveness of the hedging relationship 
the designation of a derivative as a hedge is made on the date the derivative contract is executed 
on an ongoing basis  we assess whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of hedged items 
if and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective  we discontinue hedge accounting 
all hedge ineffectiveness is included in current period earnings in other income expense  net 
we document all relationships between hedged items and derivatives 
our overall risk management strategy describes the circumstances under which we may undertake hedge transactions and enter into derivatives 
the objective of our current risk management strategy is to hedge the risk of changes in fair value attributable to interest rate risk with respect to a portion of our fixed rate debt 
the determination of fair value of derivatives is based on valuation models that use observable market quotes or projected cash flows and our view of the creditworthiness of the derivative counterparty 
if a derivative is no longer deemed to qualify as an effective hedge  changes in the fair value of that derivative could significantly affect our non operating income or expense 
acquired in process research and development charges in process research and development charges are recorded in connection with acquisitions and represent the value assigned to acquired assets which have not yet reached technological feasibility and for which there is no alternative use 
fair value is generally assigned to these assets based on the net present value of the projected cash flows expected to be generated by those assets 
significant assumptions underlying these cash flows include our assessment of the timing and our ability to successfully complete the in process research and development project  projected cash flows associated with the successful completion of the project  and interest rates used to discount these cash flows to their present value 
amortization periods we provide for amortization using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of acquired intangible assets 
we base the determination of these useful lives on the period over which we expect the related assets to contribute to our cash flows or a shorter period such that recognition of the amortization better corresponds with the distribution of expected revenues 
if our assessment of the useful lives of intangible assets changes  we may change future amortization expense 
loss contingencies we are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of our business  including claims by employees or former employees  with respect to our products and involving commercial disputes 
our financial statements do not reflect any material amounts related to possible unfavorable outcomes of claims and lawsuits to which we are currently a party because we currently believe that such claims and lawsuits are either adequately covered by insurance or otherwise indemnified  or are not expected  individually or in the aggregate  to result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
however  it is possible that our results of operations  financial position and cash flows in a particular period could be materially affected by these contingencies if we change our assessment of the likely outcome of these matters

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
to manage the volatility relating to these typical business exposures  we may enter into various derivative transactions when appropriate 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk because we have operations based in europe and we generate revenues and incur operating expenses in euros and british pounds  we will experience currency exchange risk with respect to those foreign currency denominated revenues or expenses 
in  the total cost of products we manufacture in or purchase in foreign currencies and other operating expenses that we incur in foreign currencies exceeded our total foreign currency denominated revenues 
we expect this imbalance to continue into a further weakening of the dollar against the euro and british pound could negatively affect future gross margins and operating margins 
in november  we entered into a collar contract for million euros expiring in january to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar as a result of our commitment to acquire newdeal in january for million euros see note to the financial statements 
the collar contract did not qualify as a hedge under sfas no 
accordingly  the collar contract is recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded in other income expense  net 
in  we recorded a million gain related to the change in the fair value of the collar contract 
other than this foreign currency collar  we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage operating foreign currency risk 
as the volume of our business transacted in foreign currencies increases  we will continue to assess the potential effects that changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on our business 
if we believe this potential impact presents a significant risk to our business  we may enter into additional derivative financial instruments to mitigate this risk 
interest rate risk marketable debt securities we are exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value and interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and investments in available for sale marketable debt securities 
a hypothetical basis point movement in interest rates applicable to our cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities outstanding at december  would increase or decrease interest income by approximately million on an annual basis 
we are not subject to material foreign currency exchange risk with respect to these investments 
interest rate risk long term debt and related hedging instruments we are exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations on the net interest received or paid under the terms of an interest rate swap 
at december   we had outstanding a million notional amount interest rate swap used to hedge the risk of changes in fair value attributable to interest rate risk with respect to a portion of our million principal amount fixed rate contingent convertible subordinated notes due march we receive a fixed rate from the counterparty  payable on a semi annual basis  and pay to the counterparty a floating rate based on month libor minus basis points  payable on a quarterly basis 
the floating rate resets each quarter 
the interest rate swap agreement terminates on march   subject to early termination upon the occurrence of certain events  including redemption or conversion of our contingent convertible notes 
our effective interest rate payable on the floating rate portion of the swap was as of december  our interest rate swap agreement qualifies as a fair value hedge under sfas no 
 as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
at december   the net fair value of the interest rate swap approximated million and is included in other liabilities 
the net fair value of the interest rate swap represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreement 
a hypothetical basis point movement in interest rates applicable to the interest rate swap would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately  on an annual basis
