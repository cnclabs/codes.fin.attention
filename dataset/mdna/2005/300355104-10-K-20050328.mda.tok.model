item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition an d results of operations 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgements our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accountin g principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the accountin g principles we use require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect th e reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financia l statements and amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period s presented 
we believe in the quality and reasonableness of our critica l accounting policies  however it is likely that materially different amount s would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions tha t we have consistently applied 
we believe our critical accounting policies are a s follows  including our methodology for estimates made and assumptions used 
o revenue recognition policy 
revenues from royalty and finder s agreements are recognized when earned by applying contractual royalt y rates to quarterly point of sale data  among other criteria  receive d from the company s licensees 
the company s royalty recognition polic y provides for recognition of royalties in the quarter earned  althoug h a large portion of such royalty payments are actually received durin g the month following the end of a quarter 
revenues are not recognize d unless collectibility is reasonably assured 
o trade receivables 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations on existin g and new customers daily 
we apply reserves for delinquent o r uncollectible trade receivables based on specific identificatio n methodology and also apply a general reserve based on our trad e receivable aging categories 
credit losses have been within ou r estimates over the last few years 
o deferred taxes 
deferred taxes are determined  based on th e differences between the financial statement and tax bases of asset s and liabilities  as well as the future benefit of any net operatin g loss carryforward  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year i n which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowance s are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to th e amounts expected to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuatio n allowance management considers estimates of future taxable income an d ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in accordanc e with apb opinion  the company does not accrue income taxes on th e undistributed earnings of a subsidiary which is a disc since th e repayment of the earnings of the disc is not expected in th e foreseeable future 
if circumstances change and it becomes apparen t that some or all of the undistributed earnings of the disc will b e remitted in the foreseeable future  then taxes will be accrued 
o inventory 
our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market cost has been derived principally on standard cost methodology  wher e we utilize a first in first out method 
we provide for allowances o n finished goods and specifically identify and reserve for slow movin g or obsolete raw materials and packaging 
o valuation of goodwill  long lived assets and intangible assets 
th e company periodically evaluates goodwill  long lived assets an d intangible assets for potential impairment indicators 
judgement s regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based o n estimated future cash flows  market conditions  and legal factors future events could cause the company to conclude that impairmen t indicators exist and that the net book value of goodwill  long live d assets and intangible assets is impaired 
any resulting impairmen t loss could have a material adverse impact on the company s financia l condition and results of operations 
o contingencies and litigation 
management evaluates contingen t liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordanc e with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and records accrual s when the outcome of these matters is deemed probable and the liabilit y could be reasonably estimated 
management makes these assessment s based on the facts and circumstances and in some instances based i n part on the advice of outside legal counsel 
results of operations disposal of business component on december   the company entered into its largest licensin g agreement in its history  whereby it licensed its united states women s appare l business to jacques moret  inc effective january  the company believe s that its decision to license its women s apparel business was in its bes t interests as a result of the licensee s ability to source product cheaper  du e to the licensee s buying power  along with the licensee s expanded distributio n available from its presence in certain channels of distribution
