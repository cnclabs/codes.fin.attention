item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview cytyc corporation is a leading women s health company that designs  develops  manufactures  and markets innovative and clinically effective products 
cytyc products cover a range of women s health applications  including cervical cancer screening  breast cancer risk assessment  and treatment of excessive menstrual bleeding 
we operate our business in two operating segments diagnostic products and surgical products 
our diagnostic products segment develops and markets the thinprep system for use in diagnostic cytology testing applications primarily focused on women s health  such as cervical cancer screening 
our surgical products segment manufactures and markets the novasure system  an innovative endometrial ablation device to treat menorrhagia  or excessive menstrual bleeding 
net sales in fiscal year were million  an increase of from the prior year 
we achieved strong worldwide sales growth as a result of growth in our diagnostic products business  as well as growth in net sales of the novasure system at our surgical products business acquired during the year 
the growth in our diagnostic products business primarily reflects the impact of the introduction of the thinprep imaging system  which was commercially released in june the thinprep imaging system provides a new revenue stream and also strengthens our existing thinprep system product line 
our surgical products business continued to penetrate the market for treatment of excessive menstrual bleeding and our combined sales force that now includes more than sales representatives has been integrated and trained to sell all of our product offerings 
we continue to make investments in the enhancement of our current product offerings  as well as emerging technologies in such fields as cervical cancer and breast cancer diagnosis and treatment 
we continue to make major investments in sales and marketing  including integration efforts following the novacept acquisition in march  to better support our customers and help expand market demand  as well as increase our market share 
increased investment in our future is supported by our continued strong cash flow generated from operations of million during fiscal year and our million in cash  cash equivalents and investment securities as of december  we will continue to utilize our positive cash flow from operations to invest in our existing business operations as well as to make certain strategic acquisitions or investments 
we remain committed to our goal to become the market leader in providing innovative technologies that improve women s lives 
the strength of our existing franchise in the obstetrics and gynecology ob gyn field  including the size of our dedicated sales team  our clinically driven marketing approach  and our training to date of thousands of ob gyn practitioners provide the foundation for our growth 
we are confident in our ability to drive long term shareholder value using the principles of our mission  our strong product offerings  and continued commitment to expansion of our existing product offerings 
understanding our financial information our financial information is summarized in this management s discussion and analysis  the consolidated financial statements  and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements as of december  and and for each of the three fiscal years ended december    and the following will assist you in fully understanding our financial information 
organization of financial information management s discussion and analysis provides material historical and prospective disclosures enabling investors and other users to assess our financial condition and results of operations 
the consolidated financial statements  excluding the related notes  include the consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of income  consolidated statements of stockholders equity and consolidated statements of cash flows 
the notes  which are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements  provide additional information required to fully understand the nature of amounts included in the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
a critical accounting estimate is one which is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we continuously evaluate our critical accounting estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
valuation of long lived assets  intangibles and goodwill 
intangible assets acquired in a business combination  including acquired in process research and development  are recorded under the purchase method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the fair values of acquired intangible assets are determined by management using relevant information and assumptions and assisted  in certain situations  by independent appraisers 
fair value is generally calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate  which requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates  and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate 
amortization of intangibles with defined lives is calculated either using the straight line or cash flow method 
the cash flow method requires management s estimate of net cash flows over the life of the intangible asset  reflecting the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are expected to be consumed 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and at least annually in the case of goodwill 
if it is determined that the carrying value of intangible  long lived assets and goodwill might not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we would measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method if the undiscounted cash flows did not exceed the carrying value of such assets 
no such impairment charges have been recorded to date 
we are required to perform an impairment review for goodwill on an annual basis  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
based on our impairment review during  the carrying amount of goodwill did not exceed its fair value and  accordingly  no impairment loss exists 
at december   we had million of net intangible assets  of which million represented goodwill 
an impairment of our intangible assets could result in a material  non cash expense in our consolidated statement of income 
property and equipment are depreciated over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
included in property and equipment are equipment under customer usage agreements for example  a thinprep processor or a thinprep imaging system  where we install the equipment at customer sites under an agreement whereby customers commit to purchasing minimum quantities of disposable supplies from us over a defined contract term 
under these arrangements  the equipment remains our property and we have the right to either remove the equipment or increase the price per disposable if the customer does not consume at least the number of disposable supplies committed in the contract 
the cost of the equipment is depreciated as cost of sales over its estimated useful life 
any change in conditions that would cause us to change our estimate as to the useful lives of a group or class of assets included in property and equipment may significantly increase or decrease our depreciation expense on a prospective basis 
in january  we revised our estimate of the useful lives of our equipment under customer usage agreements from the specific contract terms which are generally between three to five years to a range of three to eight years  depending on the nature of the equipment under the usage agreement 
this change in estimate was based on our assessment of historical usage patterns  the useful lives of similar devices  as well as standard practice in the medical device industry 
this change in estimate will be reflected prospectively and is not expected to have a material impact on our fiscal year financial statements for equipment under customer usage agreements as of december  income taxes and deferred taxes 
we file income tax returns in ten countries as well as many states and other localities 
we must estimate our income tax expense after considering  among other factors  differing tax rates between jurisdictions  allocation factors  tax credits  non deductible items and changes in enacted tax rates 
a change in our effective income tax rate would have the effect of changing net income by approximately million or per share 
deferred taxes arise because of the different treatment between financial statement accounting and tax accounting  known as temporary differences 
we record the tax effect of these temporary differences as deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
deferred tax assets generally result in tax deductions or credits subsequent to the period in which the related item was recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
deferred tax liabilities typically reflect a current tax deduction for which the related item has not yet been recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
the carrying value of our deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions  to fully recover the net carrying value of the assets 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statement of income 
at the acquisition date of novacept  we recorded approximately million of deferred tax assets related to acquired net operating losses nol s  tax credits and other tax assets  against which we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million on our consolidated balance sheet for uncertainties related to such items 
if we are unable to realize the benefits of these nol s in future years  we may be required to record additional tax expense in our consolidated statement of income 
legal proceedings 
we are involved in various legal actions  the outcomes of which are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
in some actions  the claimants seek damages  as well as other relief  which  if granted  would require significant expenditures 
we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we review these estimates each accounting period as additional information is known and adjust the loss provision when appropriate 
if the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated  a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
our significant legal proceedings are discussed in note d to our consolidated financial statements 
the above list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting estimates 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with little need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result

results of operations net sales percent change years ended december  in millions diagnostic products domestic international total diagnostic products surgical products total company the surgical products division was created following our acquisition of novacept on march  our fiscal year operating results include the results of novacept from the date of acquisition 
net sales for our diagnostic products division  which represented of our consolidated net sales in fiscal year  increased primarily due to increased domestic sales of our thinprep pap test the disposable supplies used in gynecological applications of the thinprep system  which increased in fiscal year  as compared to an increase of in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year reflects growth in domestic unit sales of our thinprep pap tests specifically designed for use with the thinprep imaging system commercially released in june  which generally include a fee for use of the thinprep imaging system 
these usage fees contributed more than of the increase in thinprep pap test sales during fiscal the increase in domestic net sales in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year reflects a more than increase in unit sales of the thinprep pap test 
thinprep pap test sales to our two largest customers  quest diagnostics  inc quest and laboratory corporation of america labcorp  remained consistent in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  as higher unit sales offset lower average selling prices to quest following the signing of their two year agreement with us in may sales to quest and labcorp together represented  and of our consolidated net sales in the years ended december   and  respectively 
international net sales for our diagnostic products  which represented of our consolidated net sales in fiscal year  increased in fiscal year  as compared to an increase of in fiscal year  primarily reflecting higher unit sales of the thinprep pap test and  to a lesser degree  an increase in average pricing 
the increase in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year reflects growth in both unit sales and average pricing of the thinprep pap test internationally  as well as the favorable impact of the weaker us dollar on sales in foreign currencies 
international sales grew to of diagnostics products worldwide net sales for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with and in and  respectively 
net sales for our surgical products division  which was created following our acquisition of novacept on march   represented of our consolidated net sales in fiscal year sales of the novasure single use disposable devices represented of the net sales in this division during the period 
our fiscal year operating results include the results of novacept  now renamed cytyc surgical products  from the date of acquisition 
we expect consolidated net sales for fiscal year  before the effects of any acquisitions  to increase by between and as compared to fiscal year  reflecting continued growth in both our diagnostic products and surgical products segments 
gross margin our gross margin was for fiscal year  as compared to and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin in fiscal year primarily resulted from expenses related to the introduction of the thinprep imaging system  as well as the increase in international sales of our diagnostic products  which generally have lower profit margins as compared to domestic sales of the thinprep pap test 
the increase in gross margin in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year related primarily to the increased volume of shipments and higher average selling price of the thinprep pap test during the period 
we expect our gross margin in fiscal year to be in the range of to as we continue to invest in our service and manufacturing organization to support the deployment of the thinprep imaging system 
operating expenses total operating expenses increased to million for fiscal year  an increase of  as compared to an increase of in fiscal year operating expenses in reflect the results of both our diagnostic products segment and our surgical products business acquired in march  including a charge of million to write off acquired in process research and development costs related to the acquisition of novacept 
operating expenses in include a non recurring charge of million to write off costs related to our terminated merger with digene corporation 
the following is a summary of operating expenses for the years ended december   and years ended december  percent of net sales in millions research and development in process research and development sales and marketing general and administrative expenses related to terminated merger research and development our core research and development strategy is to enhance our existing product lines  such as the thinprep imaging system released in june and the novasure system acquired when we purchased novacept in march  through operational enhancements and cost reductions  as well as to continue to develop additional innovative medical diagnostic applications of our core thinprep system 
our research and development costs increased to million in fiscal year  an increase of  compared to an increase of in  primarily reflecting our efforts to continue to improve the thinprep imaging system and the addition of development efforts related to the second generation rf controller and other operational enhancements to the novasure system at our surgical products business  as well as million in non cash amortization of the developed technology intangible asset that resulted from our acquisition of novacept 
we expect the non cash amortization of our overall developed technology portfolio to represent million of our research and development expense in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year reflects ongoing collaborative research agreements initiated in fiscal year with harvard medical school and northeastern university  where our scientists are working with the researchers at these institutions to translate their findings into further enhancements of our existing technologies 
during the past three years  our research and development costs have been related primarily to the thinprep imaging system  the firstcyte breast test and enhancements to our existing product technologies 
revenues resulting from the activities related to the thinprep imaging system  which have been placed at customer sites under use plan agreements where revenue is recognized over the term of the use plan agreement  reached of consolidated net sales in fiscal year revenues for the thinprep imaging system in the six months from its commercial release through the end of fiscal year were less than one percent of net sales 
our investment in clinical research and product development associated with the firstcyte breast test have not yet generated revenues in excess of one percent of net sales 
we continue to gather clinical data to support significant commercialization of this product 
our research and development expenditures also included enhancements to the rf controller at our surgical products business acquired in march and the thinprep processor  the batch processing system in our diagnostic products business 
while revenues from the sale of the thinprep processor were less than or equal to one percent of net sales in fiscal years  and  and revenues from the sale of the rf controller were less than two percent of net sales in fiscal year  we believe the use of these instruments by our customers has supported the growth in sales of the thinprep pap test over the past three years and the novasure single use disposable device in the period since the march acquisition 
in process research and development as part of the allocation of the purchase price of novacept  all intangible assets were identified and valued 
it was determined that certain developed and in development technology had value 
as a result of this identification and valuation process  we allocated approximately million of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to incomplete research and development activities primarily associated with an upgrade to the rf controller  a primary component of the novasure system 
at the date of acquisition  the development of the next generation rf controller had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  the acquired in process research and development was charged to expense as of the date of the acquisition 
sales and marketing sales and marketing costs increased to million for the year ended december   an increase of  as compared to a increase in fiscal year  primarily due to sales and marketing costs at our surgical products business acquired in march of approximately million  including costs following the acquisition to integrate and cross train our diagnostic products and surgical products sales forces 
in addition  we incurred increased marketing costs to support our international expansion  including efforts following the recommendation of liquid based cytology as the primary means to process samples for cervical cancer screening programs by the united kingdom s national institute for clinical excellence nice in october  as well as higher selling and customer training costs associated with supporting the continued market release of the thinprep imaging system 
overall  our sales and marketing expense remained approximately of net sales in both fiscal years and the increase in sales and marketing costs in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year reflects both market development and customer training costs associated with the thinprep imaging system  as well as our efforts towards developing the market and customer base for the thinprep pap test on an international basis  which contributed to the growth in international sales during the period 
sales and marketing expense decreased as a percentage of sales from fiscal year to fiscal year due to overall growth in net sales 
general and administrative general and administrative costs increased to million for the year ended december   an increase of  as compared to a increase in fiscal year  largely due to approximately million of general and administrative costs  such as business insurance and personnel related costs  at our surgical products business acquired in march  as well as an increase in legal costs of over million related to pending litigation 
the increase in general and administrative costs in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily reflects increased business insurance and personnel related expenditures 
general and administrative expenses represented of net sales in fiscal years and and of net sales in fiscal year other expense income  net we recorded interest expense of million for the year ended december  related to our convertible notes due  which were issued on march   including the amortization of deferred financing costs associated with the issuance of these notes 
prior to the issuance of the convertible notes  we did not have any long term debt obligations 
interest income remained consistent at million for the years ended december  and  due primarily to consistent cash balances available for investment 
interest income decreased from fiscal year to fiscal year  due primarily to lower interest rates and a lower cash balance available for investment 
income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal year was  as compared to and in fiscal years and  respectively 
exclusive of the effects of the non deductible million in process research and development charge incurred in connection with the novacept acquisition in march  our effective tax rate for fiscal year was 
the decrease from fiscal year to fiscal year is primarily due to savings from tax planning initiatives which began in we estimate that our effective tax rate for fiscal year will be  as we continue to recognize savings from these tax planning initiatives 
we are also currently evaluating what impact  if any  the american jobs creation act of will have on our effective rate for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investment securities totaling million 
cash provided by operations was million for fiscal year  an increase of  as compared to cash from operations of million in fiscal year  primarily as a result of increasing net sales  tax benefits from the novacept acquisition and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
our net accounts receivable increased to million at december   as compared to million at december   reflecting growth in net sales as well the addition of receivables from our surgical products division  which was acquired in march our days sales outstanding increased slightly from days at december  to days at december  we have had no significant issues of collectibility 
the term days sales outstanding  which we calculate by dividing gross trade accounts receivable at the end of the quarter by our average consolidated daily net sales for the quarter  refers to the estimated number of days worth of sales that are outstanding and unpaid at any given time 
our inventories increased to million at december   as compared to million at december   primarily reflecting the addition of inventory from our surgical products division 
our investing activities used cash of million in fiscal year  primarily related to the purchase of novacept in march we paid million to purchase novacept  including acquisition related costs  using a combination of debt financing and cash on hand to fund the purchase 
during fiscal year  we also invested million in equipment used under customer usage agreements  of which approximately million represented thinprep imaging systems for use at customer sites 
we also made million of capital expenditures during fiscal year  related primarily to the expansion of our manufacturing and administrative facilities to support the growth of our business as well as costs to manufacture the thinprep imaging system units to be placed at customer sites under usage agreements 
our investing activities in fiscal year used cash of million  as cash used for capital expenditures and investment in equipment under customer usage agreements was offset by proceeds from our other investing activities  including million in proceeds from the sale of investment securities  net of purchases 
during fiscal year  we made capital expenditures of million  primarily associated with the cost of opening a new distribution facility and developing redundant manufacturing capabilities 
we also invested million in equipment under customer usage agreements  of which approximately million represented thinprep imaging systems for use at customer sites 
during fiscal  we plan to incur capital expenditures of between million and million  including an investment of between million and million in thinprep imaging systems to be placed at customer sites  as well as an investment in systems and infrastructure improvements  and other machinery and equipment purchases to support the growth in our business 
our financing activities in fiscal year generated cash of million  primarily as a result of the private placement of million of convertible notes due net proceeds from this offering totaled million following payment of debt issuance costs 
we also generated cash of million as a result of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
our financing activities in fiscal year used cash of million primarily related to the repurchase of our common stock  partially funded by proceeds from the exercise of common stock options and from our employee stock purchase plan 
we spent million and million under our stock repurchase program in fiscal years and  respectively 
there have been no repurchases under this program since january on february   we announced that we have entered into a definitive merger agreement with proxima therapeutics  inc proxima  a delaware corporation and a privately held medical device company established in to develop site specific cancer treatment systems for malignant tumors 
proxima s lead product is the mammosite radiation therapy system rts for treatment of breast cancer 
under the terms of the merger agreement  we will acquire all of the outstanding shares and options of proxima in exchange for approximately million in cash  plus a two year earnout based on incremental sales growth in breast related products 
the purchase price will be paid with our available cash 
the transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of and will be subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and clearance under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act 
long term debt and contractual obligations on march   we completed the sale of million aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes due the convertible notes were sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to exemptions from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as amended 
we used the proceeds from the offering along with existing cash to finance the acquisition of novacept 
total proceeds from the private placement were million  net of debt issue costs of million 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per year on the principal amount  payable semi annually in arrears in cash on march and september of each year  beginning september  holders may require us to repurchase the notes on march of  and at a repurchase price equal to of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest and liquidated damages  if any  to  but excluding  the repurchase date 
we may redeem any of the notes beginning march   by giving holders at least days notice 
we may redeem the notes either in whole or in part at a redemption price equal to of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest and liquidated damages  if any  to  but excluding  the redemption date 
our future contractual cash obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter operating leases      inventory purchase commitments     long term debt principal   interest       total contractual cash obligations    the contractual obligations do not include any obligations that we have relating to our planned acquisition of proxima therapeutics  inc long term debt relates to our million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes described above 
the amounts in the table above include interest and principal payable assuming redemption at the earliest redemption date of march  these amounts assume that conversion of the notes into shares of our common stock does not occur 
our operating lease obligations relate primarily to our facilities  but also include certain automobiles and office equipment outside of the united states 
these operating leases have expiration dates ranging from through in addition to operating leases  we have also entered into certain long term supply contracts with remaining terms of up to eight years to assure continuity of supply of certain key components and raw materials while maintaining high quality and reliability 
in certain of these contracts  a minimum purchase commitment has been established 
our inventory purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements over the related terms and are in the normal course of business 
we expect that our cash and cash equivalents  investment securities and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our projected operating cash needs  including capital expenditures  lease and purchase commitments and tax payments 
however  from time to time  we review our capital structure and financing arrangements 
as a result of these reviews  we may periodically explore alternatives to our current structure  including the refinancing of our existing debt securities  the issuance of additional debt securities and the emplacement of a credit facility 
in addition  if we make future acquisitions  we may be required to seek additional capital 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet financing arrangements apart from the operating leases described above 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue  the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share  requiring that the dilutive effect of contingent convertible debt instruments coco s be included in dilutive earnings per share regardless of whether the triggering contingency has been satisfied 
this change in accounting principle became effective for periods ending after december  and  as required  has been applied on a retroactive basis  but had no impact on prior period dilutive earnings per share 
as a result of this new rule  potential common shares for the year ended december  included the effect of approximately million shares representing million weighted average shares for the period deemed outstanding related to the assumed conversion of the million convertible notes issued in march  regardless of whether any of the triggering contingencies had been satisfied 
these accounting rules also require that net income be adjusted to eliminate the interest expense related to the contingent convertible notes  net of the tax effect 
inclusion of the coco s decreased our diluted earnings per share for fiscal year by per share see notes p and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
on november   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing 
this standard clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and waste material spoilage 
such abnormal expenses must be recognized in the period in which they are incurred 
in addition  sfas no 
requires the allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
unallocated overheads must be recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement to have a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption 
in march  the fasb issued eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which provides new guidance for assessing impairment losses on debt and equity investments 
additionally  eitf issue no 
includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
the fasb has delayed the application of the accounting provisions until but requires new disclosures for annual periods ending after june  we do not expect the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement to have a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this standard is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values and is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  we expect to adopt sfas no 
r on july   using the standard s modified prospective application method 
adoption of sfas no 
r will not affect our cash flows or financial position  but it will reduce reported income and earnings per share because we will be required to recognize compensation expense for share purchase rights granted under our employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans  whereas we have not been required to record such expense under current accounting rules 
under sfas no 
r  we will recognize compensation expense for our share purchase rights over the vesting period  which is generally four years following the grant date 
had we expensed employee stock options and employee share purchase rights under sfas no 
for the year ended december   net income and diluted earnings per share would have been reduced by million and per share  respectively see note q in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
as share purchase rights are determined each year  the impact to our financial statements of the adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted with certainty 
however  the fair value of stock option awards disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements  but not included in compensation expense  over the last three fiscal years ranged from to per share 
under sfas no 
r  the fair value would be amortized into compensation expense over the vesting period of the stock options 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments 
we do not participate in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments for which the fair value disclosure would be required under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  or derivative commodity instruments 
all of our investments are in investment grade commercial paper  corporate bonds  municipal bonds and us government and agency securities that are carried at fair value on our books 
accordingly  we have no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
primary market risk exposures 
our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and investment securities is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but we believe this risk is immaterial due to the short term nature of these investments 
our business outside the united states is conducted primarily in local currencies  except in costa rica  where the majority of business is conducted in the us dollar 
we have no foreign exchange contracts  option contracts  or other foreign hedging arrangements 
we estimate that any market risk associated with our foreign operations is not significant and is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations
