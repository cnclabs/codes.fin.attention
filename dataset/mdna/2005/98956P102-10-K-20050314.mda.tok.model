as used in this discussion  the company means zimmer holdings  inc and its subsidiaries 
the company believes that the following developments or trends are important to understanding the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december  acquisitions of centerpulse and implex the centerpulse acquisition  completed in the fourth quarter of  had a significant impact on financial results for the year ended december  centerpulse accounted for percentage points of the company s percent sales growth for the year ended december  in addition  for the year ended december   the company incurred million of centerpulse and implex acquisition and integration expenses 
the company s gross profit margin for the year ended december  was also impacted by the centerpulse and implex acquisitions  as an inventory step up charge reduced reported gross profit by million percent of sales 
inventory step up as used herein represents the difference between the cost basis and the fair value of acquired centerpulse and implex inventories 
sfas no 
requires the recorded values for acquired inventories to be adjusted from cost to fair value at the date of acquisition based upon estimated sales price less distribution costs and a profit allowance 
inventory step up charge s as used herein represents the amount of non cash expense that is recorded upon the sale of acquired inventories 
net synergies associated with the acquisition and integration of centerpulse were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to an original estimate of million 
as anticipated  only modest synergies were recognized in cost of goods sold during more significant cost of goods synergies are expected to be recognized in and upon depletion of acquired inventories  upon completion of the transfer of production from centerpulse s us manufacturing facility in austin  texas to other company manufacturing facilities in warsaw  indiana  winterthur  switzerland and ponce  puerto rico and upon completion of the manufacturing portion of the integration plan including  for example  in sourcing forgings and castings 
operating expense synergies  principally in selling  general and administrative expenses  have exceeded the company s original expectations  reflecting more rapid than expected execution and achievement of operational efficiencies 
however  these cost synergies were partially offset by negative sales synergies losses  also anticipated  and increases in other expenses 
estimated sales losses  including distributor buy backs accounted for as sales returns related to distribution restructuring  were million for the year ended december  increases in other expenses during include higher distributor commissions  professional fees connected with corporate compliance and training programs and relocation and recruiting to fill open positions 
net synergies for are expected to approximate million compared to the company s original estimate of million 
net synergies for are expected to be in excess of million compared to the company s original estimate of to million 
the company continues to manage the integration of centerpulse 
as of december   the company has completed over percent of the  scheduled milestones required to execute the entire integration 
the company has made substantial progress in developing global combined product strategies  in integrating the sales and business organizations  and in melding essential activities as diverse as global accounting policies and procedures  manufacturing processes and e mail systems 
during  the company  among other things combined and trained sales organizations created common branding worldwide created common worldwide financial consolidation and quality systems implemented a global product development system to improve speed to market consolidated its orthobiologics research activities in austin  texas in sourced a variety of formerly out sourced manufacturing functions initiated a worldwide supply chain strategic plan for manufacturing and distribution networks unified professional medical education initiatives

in addition to the remaining manufacturing integration milestones  other integration activities still to be completed include the establishment of common information technology systems and certain warehouse consolidations 
the company expects to incur approximately million of integration expenses during to complete the remaining integration milestones 
the company completed the acquisition of implex on april  during  the company paid approximately million in initial implex acquisition costs  net of cash acquired 
the acquisition was a culmination of a distribution and strategic alliance agreement relating to the development and distribution of reconstructive implant and trauma products incorporating trabecular metal technology 
pursuant to the former distribution and strategic alliance agreement  the company sold products incorporating trabecular metal technology 
prior to the acquisition  over percent of implex sales were trabecular metal technology sales to the company 
therefore  the acquisition did not result in the immediate addition of significant new customers or sales for the company 
post acquisition profit margins on company products incorporating trabecular metal technology also did not immediately improve as these sales consisted primarily of inventory that the company already had on hand at the acquisition date 
in addition  during the company recorded amortization expense of approximately million related to acquired technology intangible assets 
therefore  the acquisition reduced diluted eps by an estimated for the year ended december  the company expects to realize significantly improved future profit margins on trabecular metal technology product sales as it sells inventory manufactured after the acquisition date 
in addition  due to continued strong demand for products incorporating trabecular metal technology  the company expects to triple its trabecular metal technology manufacturing capacity  which will lead to future sales increases and improved profit margins as a result of manufacturing efficiencies 
demand volume and mix trends on a pro forma basis  volume and mix improvements contributed percentage points of sales growth during the year ended december  orthopaedic procedure volume on a global basis continues to rise at mid to high single digit rates driven by an aging global population  proven clinical benefits  new material technologies  advances in surgical techniques such as the company s mis procedures and technologies and more active lifestyles  among other factors 
in addition  the continued shift in demand to premium products  such as longevity and durasul highly crosslinked polyethylene liners  trabecular metal technology products  high flex knees  knee and hip revision products and porous hip stems  continue to positively impact sales growth

in addition  operating segment mix and product category mix both had a positive impact on gross margins due to higher sales growth in the more profitable americas segment compared to europe and asia pacific  higher sales growth of reconstructive implants and the continued shift to premium products 
offsetting these favorable impacts were a variety of other items  including increased royalty expenses and higher losses on foreign exchange contracts included in cost of products sold  partially offset by reduced manufacturing costs due to automation  vertical integration and process improvements 
operating expenses r d as a percentage of net sales was percent for years ended december  and r d increased to million from million reflecting a full year of centerpulse research and development expenses and increased spending on active projects focused on areas of strategic significance 
the company s pipeline includes projects with a total investment equal to or greater than million 
of the projects  approximately two thirds involve new platforms  mis or other technologies 
for example  the company s orthobiological research group in austin  texas is developing innovative solutions for hip fracture and cartilage regeneration 
during  the company delivered more than major development projects to market 
the company has strategically targeted r d spending to be at the high end of what management believes to be an average of percent for the industry

operating profit  income taxes and net earnings operating profit for the year ended december  increased percent to million from million in the comparable period 
operating profit growth was driven by zimmer standalone sales growth  operating profit contributed by centerpulse  effectively controlled operating expenses and the absence of in process research and development expense in compared to million in these favorable items were partially offset by centerpulse and implex inventory step up of million in compared to million in and intangible asset amortization of million in versus million in the effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes  minority interest and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle decreased to percent for the year ended december  from percent for the same period in a major component of the decrease percent  or million was the result of revaluing deferred taxes of acquired centerpulse operations due to a reduction in the ongoing swiss tax rate 
the major reasons

sales and gross profit from centerpulse also reduced reported gross margins as centerpulse has a greater percentage of sales based in europe  where gross margins are historically lower than the us and japan 
increased zimmer standalone average selling prices in all geographic segments  the continued conversion from cemented implants to higher margin porous implants and the ongoing efforts to reduce manufacturing costs through automation  in sourcing and process improvements had positive impacts on gross profit 
the company s operating plans annually call for reductions in unit manufacturing cost of its products as a direct result of a number of factors  including but not limited to  increased volume  improvements in material technology  replacement of used machinery and equipment with higher speed equipment  changes in the configuration of manufacturing cells designed to increase throughput  labor automation as well as in sourcing 
focus on inventory cost reduction is a strategic imperative 
the company will continue to direct efforts on driving down costs of products sold  general and administrative expenses and holding costs associated with working capital 
research and development as a percentage of net sales was percent in compared to percent in  as research and development expenses increased percent from the prior year compared to a percent increase in sales 
research and development expense increased to million from million reflecting research and development expenses from centerpulse and increased spending on active projects focused on areas of strategic significance  including mis technologies  innovative materials such as trabecular metal technology and highly crosslinked polyethylene  lifestyle designs  revision implants and biological solutions 
the company has strategically targeted r d spending to be at the high end of what management believes to be an average of percent for the industry 
maintaining a robust product development pipeline has enabled zimmer to achieve significant contributions in revenue from new products  which management defines as products introduced within the prior month period 
for example  in the fourth quarter  new product revenue  excluding centerpulse  represented percent of sales  at the high end of the company s stated quarterly and annual goal of percent  in place since management expects over the next year or two to continue to invest in r d at almost percent of sales on a higher revenue base as investments in spine  biologics and new technology increase

detailed planning  monitoring and control over these expenses have also contributed to the improvement 
while well managed  the company introduced programs and activities in that involved significant investments  which  in part  are reflected in sg a 
as an example  the zimmer institute saw very active use in the zimmer institute  which is used for surgeon training  product development activities such as prototype evaluations and product and instrument training for independent field sales representatives  provided training for over surgeons  physician assistants and nurses on the mis incision hip replacement procedure and the mis quad sparing total knee procedure over the course of the cost of training is borne by the company and reported in sg a 
the acquisition of centerpulse resulted in higher sg a as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter of the change in accounting principle for instruments favorably impacted sg a by million  or percent of net sales  in acquisition and integration expenses related to the acquisition of centerpulse and incentive were million  including million of sales agent and lease contract termination expenses  million of integration consulting expenses  million of employee severance and retention expenses  million of professional fees  million of costs for meetings and activities associated with the initial cross training of employees and independent sales representatives  million of investment banking fees incurred by centerpulse  million of personnel expenses and travel for full time integration team members  million of employee relocation expenses and million of other miscellaneous acquisition and integration expenses 
operating profit increased percent to million 
operating profit growth was driven by strong organic sales growth  operating profit contributed by centerpulse and effectively controlled operating expenses 
in addition  the change in accounting principle for instruments favorably impacted operating profit by million 
these favorable items were offset by centerpulse inventory step up of million  centerpulse in process research and development write offs of million and centerpulse acquisition and integration expenses of million 
the company s effective tax rate for the year ended december  was percent  compared to percent in the decrease from percent to percent was due to expanded operations in puerto rico and the implementation of certain business strategies in which resulted in reducing taxes in certain jurisdictions and increased credits  offset by non deductible in process research and development charges

the following table sets forth the operating profit as a percentage of sales by segment for the years ended december   and percent of net sales year ended december  americas europe asia pacific year ended december  compared to year ended december  in the americas  operating profit as a percentage of sales improved slightly due to improved gross margins and controlled operating expenses 
gross profit margins increased as a result of improved average selling prices  lower royalty expenses as a percentage of net sales and the impact of a more favorable product sales mix 
product sales mix made favorable contributions as the company sold a higher concentration of more profitable reconstructive implants and spinal implants  while less profitable trauma and osp products became a smaller percentage of net sales 
royalties as a percentage of net sales declined as certain royalty contracts have fixed components and caps  or ceilings  on payments 
in addition to improved gross margins  the company effectively controlled operating expenses  including general and administrative expenses 
these improvements were offset primarily by increased selling expenses as a percentage of net sales due to the restructuring of certain distributor contracts

the following table illustrates the company s contractual obligations and and and contractual obligations total thereafter debt obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations critical accounting estimates the financial results of the company are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods 
significant accounting policies which require management s judgment are discussed below 
excess inventory and instruments the company must determine as of each balance sheet date how much  if any  of its inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at its carrying cost 
similarly  the company must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply 
reserves are established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to net realizable value 
to determine the appropriate level of reserves  the company evaluates current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of its products and instrument systems and components 
the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work in progress inventory  which is recorded at cost 
obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off 
management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions  competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 
income taxes the company estimates income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction 
realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on the company s ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits 
the company evaluates deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provides valuation allowances if it is determined to be more likely than not that the deferred tax benefit will not be realized 
federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us the company operates within numerous taxing jurisdictions 
the company is subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve 
the company makes use of all available information and makes reasoned judgments regarding matters requiring interpretation in establishing tax expense  liabilities and reserves 
the company believes adequate provisions exist for income taxes for all periods and jurisdictions subject to review or audit 
commitments and contingencies accruals for product liability and other claims are established with internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims  related fees and for claims incurred but not reported 
an actuarial model is used by the company to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims 
historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model 
the amounts established represent management s best estimate of the ultimate costs that it will incur under the various contingencies 
goodwill and intangible assets the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually  or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets  most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets 
changes to these assumptions could result in the company being required to record impairment charges on these assets

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks as part of its ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices that could impact its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the company manages its exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities  and on a limited basis  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
derivative financial instruments are used solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company is primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its transactions and net assets denominated in euros  swiss francs  japanese yen  british pounds  canadian dollars and australian dollars 
the company manages the foreign currency exposure centrally  on a combined basis  which allows the company to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets 
in order to reduce the uncertainty of foreign exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies  the company enters into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign exchange forward contracts with major financial institutions 
these forward contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions  primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions  for periods consistent with commitments 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income  then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings 
the notional amounts of outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts  principally euros  swiss francs  japanese yen  british pounds  canadian dollars and australian dollars  entered into with third parties  at december  and  were  million and million  respectively 
for contracts outstanding at december   the company has an obligation to purchase us dollars and sell euros  swiss francs  japanese yen  british pounds  canadian dollars and australian dollars or purchase swiss francs and sell us dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january through december the weighted average contract rates outstanding are euro usd  usd swiss franc  usd yen  british pound usd  usd canadian dollar and australian dollar usd 
the company maintains written policies and procedures governing its risk management activities 
the company s policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions 
on this basis  with respect to cash flow hedges  changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments 
as part of its risk management program  the company also performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue  operating results  cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates 
a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at december   indicated that  if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by percent relative to the euro  swiss franc  japanese yen  british pound  canadian dollar and australian dollar  with no change in the interest differentials  the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through  depending on the direction of the change  by an average approximate amount of million  million  million  million  million and million for the euro  swiss franc  japanese yen  british pound  canadian dollar and australian dollar contracts  respectively 
any change in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction 
consequently  foreign exchange contracts would not subject the company to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets  liabilities  and transactions being hedged 
the company had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately  million at december   primarily in swiss francs  japanese yen and euros 
approximately  million of the net asset exposure at december  relates to goodwill recorded in the europe and asia pacific geographic segments 
the company enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency 
as a result  foreign currency translation gains losses recognized in earnings under sfas no 
 foreign currency translation are generally offset with gain losses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period 
commodity price risk the company purchases raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome  titanium  tantalum  polymer and sterile packaging 
the company enters into to month supply contracts  where available  on these commodities to alleviate the impact of market fluctuation in prices 
as part of the company s risk management program  sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes are performed 
a percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents zimmer holdings  inc 
and subsidiaries form k interest rate risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could impact its results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to interest rate risks through its regular operations and financing activities 
presently  the company invests its cash and equivalents in money market and investment grade short term debt instruments 
the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of its invested principal funds by limiting default and market risk 
currently  the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk arises principally from the variable rates associated with its credit facilities 
the company is subject to interest rate risk through movements in interest rates on the committed senior credit facility and its uncommitted credit facilities 
presently  all of its debt outstanding bears interest at short term rates 
the company currently does not hedge its interest rate exposure  but may do so in the future 
based upon the company s overall interest rate exposure as of december   a change of percent in interest rates or basis points  assuming the amount outstanding remains constant  would result in an annual increase of interest expense of approximately million 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no such action  nor management actions to mitigate interest rate changes 
further  this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk  are primarily cash  cash equivalents  counterparty transactions  and accounts receivable 
the company places its investments in highly rated financial institutions and money market instruments  and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one entity 
the company does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on its cash and equivalents and investments 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the financial institutions with which it conducts business 
however  this loss is limited to the amounts  if any  by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed the obligation of the company 
the company also minimizes exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions 
credit risk is managed through the monitoring of counterparty financial condition and by the use of standard credit guidelines 
the company does not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business 
however  essentially all of the company s trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and  accordingly  are exposed to their respective business  economic and country specific variables 
repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries national economic and health care systems 
exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring procedures and the company believes that reserves for losses are adequate 
there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer or other major concentration of credit risk
