item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this annual report 
general 
we operate as a real estate investment trust  or reit  that principally acquires  renovates  develops and manages community and neighborhood shopping centers located predominantly in high growth markets in the southern united states and in the boston  massachusetts metropolitan area 
our shopping centers are primarily anchored by supermarkets or other necessity oriented retailers such as drug stores or discount retail stores 
as of december   our portfolio consisted of properties  comprising supermarket anchored shopping centers  eight drug store anchored shopping centers  other retail anchored shopping centers  four retail development parcels  and three commercial properties  as well as a non controlling interest in one unconsolidated joint venture that owns a parcel of land 
we believe we distinguish ourselves by owning and operating shopping centers anchored by supermarkets or necessity oriented retailers in high density areas that are experiencing higher than average population growth or that provide particularly strong barriers to additional competition 
our goal is to own and operate properties containing dominant supermarket operators and a diverse tenant mix 
we believe that these characteristics combine to reduce the vulnerability of our properties to economic downturns  enhance consumer traffic through our properties and generate more stable cash flows over time 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from tenants under existing leases at our properties 
our business is generally dependent on the performance of the economy in the areas in which we own properties and the cost of financing available to fund our growth 
changes in the economic environment tend to have a direct effect on our tenants businesses and  therefore  their ability to continue to pay us rent 
in  the overall us economy demonstrated sustained economic growth 
this growth  as well as the prevailing low interest rate environment  contributed to the growth in our cash flows and allowed us to increase the occupancy rates at our centers during the year 
during the later part of  however  the federal reserve raised interest rates and has continued to do so in early we expect further increases in which will make our cost of capital higher 
overview 
in  we followed a disciplined approach and took advantage of the improving economic environment in our markets 
we focused on acquiring shopping centers in high growth  high density metropolitan areas of the united states  developing and redeveloping centers in these areas and selling properties that no longer met our investment criteria 
during  we expanded our geographic diversity beyond the southern united states where we have operated historically by acquiring six retail properties in the boston  massachusetts metropolitan area 
our property acquisitions during were financed using our revolving lines of credit  proceeds from the sale of properties  issuances of equity and public debt and assumed mortgages 
in the event we consummate future acquisitions  we anticipate using similar financing sources 
however  there can be no assurances that these sources will be available to us in the future at reasonable terms or at all 
the highlights of our activity include we acquired properties and three land parcels for aggregate consideration of approximately million 
we sold properties for aggregate consideration of approximately million  and also sold a property held by a joint venture 
we completed the development of a drug store anchored shopping center containing  square feet of gross leasable area and added  square feet to an existing center  started development of a supermarket anchored center and have over developments and redevelopments in various stages of work 
during march of  we raised million in an offering of unsecured senior notes 
the unsecured senior notes have a stated interest rate of and mature in april of we swapped million of these notes to a floating rate of month libor in arrears plus 
we expanded our geographic diversity into the boston  massachusetts metropolitan area by acquiring six supermarket anchored centers  that aggregate  square feet of gross leaseable area for an aggregate consideration of approximately million 
we increased the base rental rate by on lease renewals aggregating  square feet to per square foot 
we executed new leases totaling million square feet at an average rate of per square foot and increased our occupancy rate to in the core shopping center portfolio 
business uncertainties 
our long term operating cash flow is dependent on the continued occupancy of our properties  the rents that we are able to charge to our tenants and the ability of these tenants to make their rental payments 
the main long term threat to our business is our dependence on the viability of our anchor and other tenants 
general economic downturns and competition from national and regional supercenters  such as wal mart and target or other discount retailers  may have an increasingly adverse impact on the business of our tenants by taking customers or reducing operating margins 
for example  on february   winn dixie stores  inc  an anchor tenant at of our shopping centers occupying  square feet of gross leasable area and accounting for approximately million in annualized minimum rent  filed for bankruptcy protection 
although winn dixie has not yet rejected any of its leases at our centers  if it elects to close some or all its stores at these centers and terminate those leases  it would adversely affect our operating results  including funds from operations 
we believe  however  that these risks are mitigated by concentrating on high density  urban areas  leasing to the dominant supermarket operators in the markets in which we own properties and maintaining a diverse tenant mix 
other than winn dixie  we are not currently aware of any pending tenant bankruptcies that are likely to materially affect our rental revenues 
in addition  although we have enjoyed a low interest rate environment in recent years  the increase in interest rates over the last six months has had  and anticipated future increases in the coming months will have an adverse effect on the cost of our future borrowings  including borrowings under our revolving credit facilities  which are based on variable interest rates  and the million of our senior notes that we have swapped to a variable rate 
as interest rates rise  the interest we incur on these loans will increase 
notwithstanding these business uncertainties  we are optimistic that we are well positioned to take advantage of the sustained growth of the economy and that the growth in rents and occupancy will mitigate increases in operating or financing costs 
short term liquidity needs 
as of december   we had million in cash and million available to be drawn under our revolving credit facilities 
our cash flow from operations was million for the year ended december  our short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for operating and other expenses directly associated with our portfolio of properties  general and administrative expenses including payroll and related costs  interest expense and scheduled principal payments on our outstanding debt  capital expenditures incurred to facilitate the leasing of space eg  tenant improvements and leasing commissions  development and redevelopment activities  quarterly dividends paid to our common stockholders and distributions made to holders of operating partnership units 
historically  we have satisfied these requirements principally through cash generated from operations 
we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our short term liquidity requirements  however  there are risks inherent in our business  including those risks described in item business risk factors  that may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow  and therefore  on our ability to meet these requirements 
certain of our mortgage loans involving an aggregate principal balance of approximately million contain prohibitions on transfers of ownership which may have been violated by our previous issuances of common stock or in connection with past acquisitions and may be violated by transactions involving the company s capital stock in the future 
if a violation were established  it could serve as a basis for a lender to accelerate amounts due under the affected mortgage 
to date  no lender has notified us that it intends to accelerate its mortgage 
in the event that the mortgage holders declare defaults under the mortgage documents  we will  if required  prepay the remaining mortgage from existing resources  refinancing of such mortgages  borrowings under our other lines of credit or other sources of financing 
based on discussions with various lenders  current credit market conditions and other factors  we believe that the mortgages will not be accelerated 
accordingly  we believe that the violations of these prohibitions will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
our current development plans include development and redevelopment projects  the aggregate cost of which including costs incurred in prior years on these projects is expected to be approximately million and of which million remains unfunded based on our current plans 
we intend to fund these costs from our unsecured revolving credit facilities and cash generated from operations 
we are likely to initiate other projects over the course of which have an undetermined cost 
we may incur significant expenditures in connection with the re leasing of our retail space  principally in the form of tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
the amounts of these expenditures can vary significantly  depending on negotiations with tenants and the willingness of tenants to pay higher base rents over the life of the leases 
we also incur expenditures for certain recurring capital expenses 
we expect to pay for re leasing and recurring capital expenditures out of cash from operations 
as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income to our stockholders on an annual basis 
therefore  as a general matter  it is unlikely that we will be able to retain any substantial cash balances that could be used to meet our liquidity needs 
instead  these needs must be met with cash generated from current operations and external sources of capital 
during  we paid million of dividends on our common stock or per share 
the maintenance of these dividends is subject to various factors  including the discretion of our board of directors  our ability to pay dividends under maryland law  the availability of cash to make the necessary dividend payments and the effect of reit distribution requirements 
long term liquidity needs 
our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the principal amount of our long term debt as it matures  significant non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically at our properties  development and redevelopment projects that we undertake at our properties and the costs associated with acquisitions of properties or other companies 
historically  we have satisfied these requirements principally through what we believe to be the most advantageous source of capital available at the time  which has included the incurrence of new debt through borrowings under credit facilities and the issuance of debt securities  sales of common stock  capital raised through the disposition of assets  and joint venture transactions 
we believe that these sources of capital will continue to be available in the future to fund our long term capital needs  however  there are risks inherent in our business  including those risks described in item business risk factors  that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources 
our ability to incur additional unsecured debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including our degree of leverage  the value of our unencumbered assets  our credit rating and borrowing restrictions imposed by existing lenders 
currently  we have investment grade credit ratings for our unsecured senior debt from two major rating agencies standard poor s and moody s investors service 
a downgrade in outlook or rating by a rating agency can occur at any time if the agency perceives an adverse change in our financial condition  results of operations or ability to service debt 
if such a downgrade occurs  it would increase the interest rates currently payable under our existing credit facilities and certain of our debt securities  would likely increase the costs associated with obtaining future financing  and adversely affect our ability to obtain future financing 
the indentures under which our publicly traded debt securities are issued also contain certain restrictions on our ability to incur debt and other financial covenants 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding future contractual obligations  excluding interest  as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years mortgage notes payable scheduled amortization balloon payments total mortgage obligations unsecured revolving credit facilities unsecured senior notes capital leases operating leases development and redevelopment total contractual obligations the following table sets forth certain information regarding future interest obligations on outstanding debt as of december  in thousands payments due by period interest obligations total less than year years years more than years mortgage notes unsecured senior notes unsecured revolving credit facilities total interest obligations million of the outstanding balance has been swapped to a floating interest rate based on the month libor in arrears  plus 
the contractual and interest obligation for the unsecured senior notes do not reflect this interest rate swap 
interest on the unsecured revolving credit facility is variable  these amounts assume the weighted average interest rate remains the same as the rate at december  of 
we have entered into employment contracts with several of our key executives 
these contracts provide for base pay  bonuses based on our results of operations  options and restricted stock grants and reimbursement of other various expenses 
off balance sheet arrangements we have an off balance sheet joint venture and other unconsolidated arrangements with varying structures 
as of december   our off balance sheet arrangements were as follows letters of credit totaling million have been provided as security for certain performance requirements  and we have committed to fund million  based on current plans and estimates  in order to complete pending development and redevelopment projects 
these obligations  comprised principally of construction contracts  are generally due as the work is performed and are expected to be financed by our available credit facilities 
the unconsolidated joint venture owns a parcel of land that is held for future development or sale 
we are obligated to fund of any working capital that is required as determined jointly by us and our joint venture partner 
the current obligations are a nominal amount to pay property taxes and other carrying costs 
the joint venture currently has no outstanding debt obligations or contractual commitments and we have not guaranteed any obligations or retained any contingent interest in any assets 
we expect to fund these obligations from working capital and availability under our revolving credit facilities 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides additional information related to our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates and if necessary  adjusts its estimates and judgments  including those related to real estate and development assets  revenue recognition in conjunction with providing development  leasing and management services and equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
real estate properties and development assets 
we capitalize acquisition and construction costs  property taxes  interest and other miscellaneous costs that are directly identifiable with a project  from pre acquisition until the time that construction is complete and the development is ready for its intended use  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and sfas no 
we allocate the capitalized project costs to the various components of the project based on the components relative fair values 
our cost allocation method requires the use of management estimates regarding the fair market value of each project component 
management bases its estimates on current market appraisals  comparable sales  existing sale and purchase contracts  replacement cost  historical experience  and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the fair market values of real estate assets 
actual results may differ from these estimates and anticipated returns on a project  as well as the gain or loss on disposition of the individual project components  could vary significantly from estimated amounts 
management reviews long lived assets used in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable and the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount 
if such asset is considered to be impaired  we record impairment losses and reduce the carrying amount of the impaired asset to an amount that reflects the fair value of the asset at the time impairment is evident 
our impairment review process relies on management s judgment regarding the indicators of impairment  the remaining life of the asset used to generate the asset s undiscounted cash flows  and the fair value of the asset at a particular point in time 
management uses historical experience  current market appraisals and various other assumptions to form the basis for making judgments about the impairment of real estate assets 
under different assumptions or conditions  the asset impairment analysis may yield a different outcome  which would alter the ultimate return on our assets  as well as the gain or loss on the eventual disposition of the asset 
business combinations 
we are actively pursuing acquisition opportunities and will not be successful in all cases  costs incurred related to these acquisition opportunities are expensed when it is probable that we will not be successful in the acquisition 
the results of operations of any acquired property are included in our financial statements as of the date of its acquisition 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies and properties to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
fair value is defined as the amount at which that asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
in order to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies and properties to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  we identify and estimate the fair value of the land  buildings and improvements  review the leases to determine the existence of  and estimate the fair value of  any contractual or other legal rights and investigates the existence of  and estimate the fair value of  any other identifiable intangibles 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangibles 
the cost approach is used as the primary method to estimate the fair value of the buildings  improvements and other assets 
the cost approach is based upon the current costs to develop the particular asset in that geographic location  less an allowance for physical and functional depreciation 
the assigned value for buildings and improvements is based on an as if vacant basis 
the market value approach is used as the primary method to estimate the fair value of the land 
the determination of the fair value of contractual intangibles is based on the costs incurred to originate a lease  including commissions and legal costs  excluding any new leases negotiated in connection with the purchase of a property 
in place lease values are based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each lease and our overall relationship with each tenant 
among the factors considered in the allocation of these values include the nature of the existing relationship with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality  the expectation of lease renewals  the estimated carrying costs of the property during a hypothetical expected lease up period  current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
estimated carrying costs include real estate taxes  insurance  other property operating costs and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the hypothetical expected lease up periods  given the specific market conditions 
above market  below market and in place lease values are determined based on the present value using a discount rate reflecting the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the leases negotiated and in place at the time of acquisition and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the property or equivalent property  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
the value of contractual intangibles is amortized over the remaining term of each lease 
other than as discussed above  we have determined that our real estate properties do not have any other significant identifiable intangibles 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangibles and the assumptions of what marketplace participants would use in making estimates of fair value include  but are not limited to future expected cash flows  estimated carrying costs  estimated origination costs  lease up periods and tenant risk attributes  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired lease will continue to be used in our portfolio and discount rates used in these calculations 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may not always reflect unanticipated events and changes in circumstances may occur 
in making such estimates  management uses a number of sources  including appraisals or other market data  as well as  information obtained in its pre acquisition due diligence and marketing and leasing activities 
goodwill 
we are required to perform annual impairment tests of our goodwill and intangible assets and more frequently in certain circumstances 
goodwill is no longer amortized 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values  which include the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires us to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
the key assumptions we made to determine the fair value of our reporting units each property is considered a reporting unit under sfas no 
included a net operating income  b cash flows  and c the estimated fair value  which was based on our experience in evaluating acquisitions and market conditions 
a variance in the net operating income or discount rate could have had a significant impact on the amount of the goodwill impairment charge recorded 
management cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled million at december  such events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our tenants  or a material negative change in our relationships with significant tenants 
revenue recognition 
as lessor  we retain substantially all the risks and benefits of property ownership and account for our leases as operating leases 
rental income is recognized over the lease term on a straight line basis 
revenue from percentage rent is recognized when tenants reported sales have reached certain levels specified in the respective leases 
recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period when the applicable costs are incurred 
termination fees are recognized when a tenant s lease is terminated 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required rent payments 
the computation of this allowance is based on the tenants payment history and current credit quality 
if our estimate of collectibility differs from the cash received the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 
we do not consider ourselves to be in control of joint ventures when major business decisions require the approval of at least one other managing equity owner 
accordingly  we account for the one joint venture in which we do not retain unilateral control under the equity method 
we calculate the equity in income or loss earned from our unconsolidated joint ventures based on each equity owners economic ownership  which is estimated based on anticipated stabilized cash flows as they would be allocated to each equity owner based on how cash flow is distributed 
generally  under the terms of the respective joint venture agreements  net ordinary cash flow is distributed to each equity owner in accordance with such owner s equity ownership percentages 
results of operations our consolidated results of operations often are not comparable from period to period due to the impact of property acquisitions  dispositions  developments and redevelopments 
a large portion of the change in our statement of operations line items is related to these changes in our property portfolio 
the activity of the former irt property company is included in our operating results commencing on february   the date we completed our merger with irt 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases on each of our properties 
these revenues include fixed base rents  recoveries of expenses that we have incurred and that we pass through to the individual tenants and percentage rents that are based on specified percentages of tenants revenues  in each case as provided in the particular leases 
our primary cash expenses consist of our property operating expenses  which include real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance  management expenses  insurance  utilities and other expenses  general and administrative expenses  which include payroll  office expenses  professional fees and other administrative expenses  and interest expense  primarily on mortgage debt  unsecured senior debt and revolving credit facilities indebtedness 
in addition  we incur substantial non cash charges for depreciation and amortization on our properties 
we also capitalize certain expenses  such as taxes and interest  incurred in respect of property under development or redevelopment until the property is ready for its intended use 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following summarizes items from our audited consolidated statements of operations that we think are important in understanding our results of operations and or those items which have significantly changed in compared to in thousands for the year ended december  change total rental revenue property operating expenses rental property depreciation and amortization general and administrative expenses interest expense total rental revenue increased by million  or  to million in from million in the following factors accounted for this difference properties acquired during increased rental revenue by approximately million  the full year benefited from properties acquired during which increased rental revenue by approximately million  the acquisition of irt increased rental revenue by approximately million  the completion of development and redevelopment properties increased rental revenue by million  and same property rental revenue increased by million in due to higher occupancy at the centers and increases in rental rates 
property operating expenses increased by million  or  to million for from million in the following factors accounted for this difference properties acquired during increased operating expenses by approximately million  properties acquired during increased the full year operating expenses by million  the acquisition of irt increased operating expenses by approximately million  the completion of development and redevelopment properties increased operating expenses by  and same property operating expenses decreased by  as a result of lower property maintenance expenses 
rental property depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million for from million in the following factors accounted for this difference properties acquired during increased depreciation and amortization by million  properties acquired during increased full year depreciation and amortization expense by million  the acquisition of irt increased depreciation and amortization expense by approximately million  completion of development and redevelopment properties increased depreciation and amortization by million  and same property depreciation and amortization increased by  related to leasing and tenant improvement amortization 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for from million in compensation and employer related expenses increased by million  including million of deferred compensation expense associated with the issuance of restricted stock that vests over time and  of compensation and related expenses due to an increase of staffing 
the general and administrative expenses also included an increase in professional fees of  related to the compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and a write off of million of pre acquisition due diligence costs related to a corporate transaction that did not materialize interest expense increased by million  or  to million for from million in this difference was primarily due to an increase of million attributable to the million unsecured senior notes issued in march  interest incurred on the assumption of debt related to the acquisition of properties during increased interest by million  properties acquired during  including the acquisition of irt  increased interest expense by million due to assumption of mortgage loans  interest incurred on same properties decreased by  due to the repayment of certain existing mortgage notes  interest on the revolving credit facilities decreased by  due to repayment of outstanding balances received from the proceeds upon the issuance of the senior notes and decreased borrowing activities  and capitalized interest decreased due to the completion of development and redevelopment activities which increased interest expense by  we sold properties including one property held by a joint venture  and have one property held for sale at december  the million operating results of these properties are reflected as income from rental properties sold or held for sale 
the sales of the properties produced gains of million for the discontinued operations of million reflect a reclassification of operations for properties sold during and we recognized gains of million in related to the sales of properties during during  the limited partners of irt partners lp elected to convert their partnership interest for our common stock 
this conversion resulted in a decrease in the minority interest 
as a result of the foregoing  net income increased by million  or  to million for from million in year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following summarizes items from our audited condensed consolidated statements of operations that we think are important in understanding our operations and or those items which significantly changed in compared to in thousands for the year ended december  change total rental revenue property operating expenses rental property depreciation and amortization general and administrative expenses interest expense total rental revenue increased by million  or  to million in from million in the following factors accounted for this difference the acquisition of irt increased rental revenue by approximately million  properties acquired during increased rental revenue by approximately million  properties acquired during increased rental revenue by approximately million  same property rental revenue increased by approximately million  and the completion of development and redevelopment properties increased rental revenue by approximately million 
property operating expenses increased by million  or  to million for from million in the following factors accounted for this difference the acquisition of irt increased property operating expenses by approximately million and property management expenses by million as a result of managing a larger portfolio of properties  properties acquired during increased operating expenses by approximately million  properties acquired during increased operating expenses by approximately million  same property operating expenses increased by approximately  and the completion of development and redevelopment properties increased operating expenses by  rental property depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million for from million in the following factors accounted for this difference the acquisition of irt increased depreciation and amortization by approximately million  properties acquired during increased depreciation and amortization by approximately million  properties acquired during increased depreciation and amortization by approximately million  same property depreciation and amortization increased by  related to leasing and tenant improvement amortization  and the completion of development and redevelopment properties increased depreciation and amortization by  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for from million in compensation and employer related expenses increased by million and other general office expenses increased by  these expense increases were due to the increase in staffing resulting from the irt acquisition 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million for from million in this difference was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of million as a result of the assumption of mortgage loans and senior notes in the acquisition of irt  an increase of  attributable to the debt related to the acquisition of properties during  and an increase in revolving credit facility interest of million primarily related to the acquisition of irt 
these increases in interest expense were partially offset by the repayment of nine loans which reduced interest by  and an increase in capitalized interest related to development activity  which reduced interest expense by million 
during  we settled certain mortgage notes at a discount and recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt of  minority interest increased by  related to the interests that were assumed as part of the acquisition of irt 
as a result of the foregoing  net income increased by million  or  to million for from million in liquidity and capital resources we anticipate that cash flows from operating activities will continue to provide adequate capital for dividend payments in accordance with the irs reit requirements and our operating needs 
depending on capital market conditions  we anticipate using cash on hand  borrowings under our existing unsecured revolving credit facilities  assumptions of mortgages issuance of unsecured public debt and equity as well as other similar financing to provide the necessary capital to meet our needs 
cash flows 
net cash provided by operations of million for the year ended december  included i net income of million  ii adjustments for non cash and gain on sale items which increased cash flow by million  and iii a net change in operating liabilities over operating assets of million  compared to net cash provided by operations of million for the year ended december   which included i net income of million  ii adjustments for non cash and gain on sale items which increased cash flow by million  and iii an increase in net operating assets over operating liabilities of million 
net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  included the acquisition of i three parcels of land held for future development  and seventeen shopping centers for million  ii construction  development and other capital improvements of million  iii increased leasing costs of million  iv the purchase of securities held for investment of million  offset by a proceeds from the sale of properties of million  b distributions from joint ventures of million  c proceeds from payments of notes receivable of million  and e proceeds from the sale of securities held for investment of million 
these amounts should be compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  which included i the acquisition of one parcel of land held for future development  an out parcel and ten shopping centers for million  ii construction  development and other capital improvements of million  iii the acquisition of irt for million  net of cash received  and iv increased leasing costs of million  offset by a proceeds from the sale of six properties and two joint venture interests of million  b proceeds from funds escrowed in connection with the sale of properties to utilize tax deferred exchanges of million  c proceeds from re payments of notes receivable of million  and d proceeds from other sources of million

these amounts should be compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  which included i net borrowings on revolving credit facilities of million  less the pay down of million on the credit facility assumed in the irt merger  ii net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million  and iii proceeds from the repayment of notes receivable of million  offset by a the repayment of ten mortgage notes aggregating million and monthly principal payments on mortgage notes of million  b cash dividends paid to common stockholders of million  and c other miscellaneous uses of million 
debt 
the following is a summary of our borrowings consisting of mortgage notes payable  unsecured senior notes payable and unsecured revolving credit facilities in thousands december  mortgage notes payable fixed rate mortgage loans unamortized net premium on mortgage notes payable total the weighted average interest rate at december  and was and  respectively  excluding the effects of the net premium adjustment 
each of the existing mortgage loans is secured by a mortgage on one or more of our properties 
certain of the mortgage loans involving an aggregate principal balance of approximately million contain prohibitions on transfers of ownership which may have been violated by our previous issuances of common stock or in connection with past acquisitions and may be violated by transactions involving our capital stock in the future 
if a violation were established  it could serve as a basis for a lender to accelerate amounts due under the affected mortgage 
to date  no lender has notified us that it intends to accelerate its mortgage 
in the event that the mortgage holders declare defaults under the mortgage documents  we will  if required  prepay the remaining mortgage from existing resources  refinancing of such mortgages  borrowings under our other lines of credit or other sources of financing 
based on discussions with various lenders  current credit market conditions and other factors  we believe that the mortgages will not be accelerated 
accordingly  we believe that the violations of these prohibitions will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
december  unsecured senior notes payable senior notes  due senior notes  due senior notes  due senior notes  due fair value of interest rate swap unamortized net premium on unsecured senior notes payable total we swapped million of the million notes to a floating interest rate based on the month libor in arrears plus 
the weighted average interest rate at december  and was and  respectively  excluding the effects of the interest rate swap and net premium adjustment 
the indentures under which the notes were issued have several covenants which limit our ability to incur debt  require us to maintain unencumbered asset ratios and limit our ability to consolidate  sell  lease  or convey substantially all of our assets to  or merge with any other entity 
these notes have also been guaranteed by most of our subsidiaries 
the interest rate on the senior notes is subject to a basis point increase if we do not maintain an investment grade debt rating 
currently our unsecured senior debt is rated investment grade by moody s at baa and standard poor s at bbb  both with a stable outlook 
december  unsecured revolving credit facilities wells fargo city national bank total we have entered into a million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks for which wells fargo bank  national association is the sole lead arranger and administrative agent 
this facility bears interest at our option at i libor plus to  depending on the credit ratings of our senior unsecured long term notes  or ii at the greater of x wells fargo s prime rate and y the federal funds rate plus 
the facility is guaranteed by most of our subsidiaries 
based on our current rating  the libor spread is 
the facility also includes a competitive bid option which allows us to conduct auctions among the participating banks for borrowings in an amount not to exceed million  a million swing line facility for short term borrowing and a million letter of credit commitment and may  at our request  be increased up to a total commitment of million 
the facility expires february  with a one year extension option 
in addition  the facility contains customary covenants  including financial covenants regarding debt levels  total liabilities  interest coverage  ebitda coverage ratios  unencumbered properties and permitted investments 
the facility also prohibits stockholder distributions in excess of of funds from operations calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ending 
notwithstanding this limitation  we can make stockholder distributions to avoid income taxes on asset sales 
if a default under the facility exists  our ability to pay dividends would be limited to the amount necessary to maintain the company s status as a reit unless the default is a payment default or bankruptcy event in which case we would be prohibited from paying any dividends 
the weighted average interest rate as of december  and was and  respectively 
we also have a million unsecured credit facility with city national bank of florida  of which there was no outstanding balance as of december  and this facility also provides collateral for million in outstanding letters of credit 
as of december   the availability under the various credit facilities was approximately million  net of outstanding balances and letters of credit 
at december   our fully diluted market capitalization totaled billion  comprising million shares of common stock and million of net debt excluding any unamortized fair market premium discount and net of cash 
our ratio of net debt to total market capitalization was  and our ratio of net debt to gross real estate cost and securities investments was 
our debt level could subject us to various risks  including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest  and the risk that the resulting reduced financial flexibility could inhibit our ability to develop or improve our rental properties  withstand downturns in our rental income or take advantage of business opportunities 
in addition  because we currently anticipate that only a small portion of the principal of our indebtedness will be repaid prior to maturity  it is expected that it will be necessary to refinance the majority of our debt 
accordingly  there is a risk that such indebtedness will not be able to be refinanced or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our current indebtedness

maturity unsecured variable rate revolving credit facilities wells fargo city national bank libor total unsecured variable rate revolving credit facilities total debt the rate in effect on december  million of the outstanding balance has been swapped to a floating interest rate based on the month libor in arrears  plus 
the indicated rate and weighted average rate for the unsecured senior notes do not reflect this interest rate swap 
our mortgage and outstanding revolving credit facilities indebtedness outstanding at december  will require approximate balloon and scheduled principal payments as follows in thousands secured debt unsecured debt year due scheduled amortization balloon payments revolving credit facilities senior notes total thereafter total we may not have sufficient funds on hand to repay these balloon amounts at maturity 
therefore  we expect to refinance this indebtedness either through additional mortgage financing secured by individual properties or groups of properties  by unsecured private or public debt offerings or by additional equity offerings 
our results of operations could be affected if the cost of new debt is greater or lesser thanthe cost of the meeting debt 
if new financing is not available  we could be required to sell assets and our business would be adversely affected 
development activity 
as of december   we had over development and redevelopment projects underway or in the planning stage totaling approximately million of asset value and requiring approximately million to complete based on current plans and estimates 
the more significant of these include cvs plaza in miami  florida where we are completing the lease up of the local space at a new  square foot drug store anchored shopping center that we built across the street from our recently completed publix supermarket anchored plaza alegre shopping center  shops at skylake in north miami beach  florida  where we are in the process of adding  square feet of retail and office space  centre pointe plaza in smithfield  north carolina and eustis square in eustis  florida where we have reconfigured and redeveloped previously vacant anchor and other space and are completing the associated lease up  and the development of two supermarket anchored shopping centers  one in homestead  florida and the other in mcdonough  georgia  both on parcels of land we currently own 
these developments and redevelopments are scheduled for completion between early and the end of shelf registration 
we have filed universal shelf registration statements with the securities and exchange commission  which will permit us  from time to time  to offer and sell various types of securities  including common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  depositary shares and warrants 
the registration statements provide us additional flexibility in accessing capital markets to fund future growth and for general corporate purposes 
we now have approximately million of availability under our existing shelf registration statements 
equity 
for the year ended december   we issued  shares of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options at prices ranging from to per share 
we also issued million shares of common stock at prices ranging from to per share pursuant to our divided reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
as of december   we have million shares remaining for sale under our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
future capital requirements 
we believe  based on currently proposed plans and assumptions relating to our operations  that our existing financial arrangements  together with cash generated from our operations  will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for a period of at least twelve months 
in the event that our plans change  our assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate or cash flows from operations or amounts available under existing financing arrangements prove to be insufficient to fund our expansion and development efforts or to the extent we discover suitable acquisition targets the purchase price of which exceeds our existing liquidity  we would be required to seek additional sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all  and any future equity financing could be dilutive to existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  our business operations could be materially adversely affected 
distributions 
we believe that we currently qualify  and intend to continue to qualify in the future  as a reit under the internal revenue code 
as a reit  we are allowed to reduce taxable income by all or a portion of our distributions to stockholders 
as distributions have exceeded taxable income  no provision for federal income taxes has been made 
while we intend to continue to pay dividends to our stockholders  we also will reserve such amounts of cash flow as we consider necessary for the proper maintenance and improvement of our real estate and other corporate purposes while still maintaining our qualification as a reit 
our cash distributions for the year ended december  were million 
new accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for the classification and measurement of financial instruments that possess characteristics similar to both liability and equity instruments 
sfas no 
also addresses the classification of certain financial instruments that include an obligation to issue equity shares 
on october   the fasb voted to defer  for an indefinite period  the application of the guidance in fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
we have adopted certain provisions of sfas no 
which did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we are still evaluating the potential impact of the provisions of sfas that have been deferred to future periods 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the new standard will be effective for public entities excluding small business issuers in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june   irrespective of the entity s fiscal year 
early adoption is permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
sfas r allows for two transition alternatives for public companies a modified prospective transition or b modified retrospective transition 
under the modified prospective transition method  companies are required to recognize compensation cost for share based payments to employees based on their grant date fair value from the beginning of the fiscal period in which the recognition provisions are first applied 
measurement and attribution of compensation cost for awards that were granted prior to  but not vested as of the date sfas r is adopted would be based on the same estimate of the grant date fair value and the same attribution method used previously under sfas either for financial statement recognition or pro forma disclosure purposes 
prior periods are not restated 
for periods prior to adoption  the financial statements are unchanged and the pro forma disclosures previously required by sfas continue to be required under the new standard to the extent those amounts differ from those in the income statement 
for periods subsequent to adoption  the impact of this transition method generally is the same as if the modified retrospective method were applied 
accordingly  pro forma disclosure will not be necessary for periods after the adoption of the new standard 
under the modified retrospective transition method  companies are allowed to restate prior periods by recognizing compensation cost in the amounts previously reported in the pro forma footnote disclosure under the provisions of sfas new awards and unvested awards would be accounted for in the same manner as the modified prospective method 
because of the mid year effective date  companies are permitted to apply the modified retrospective transition alternative either a to all periods presented or b to the start of the fiscal year in which sfas r is adopted 
we are currently evaluating the different alternatives 
had we adopted sfas in  our diluted earnings per share would have been lower 
in december of  the fasb issued statement  exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in that opinion  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
statement amends opinion by eliminating the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
this statement shall be applied prospectively and is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  this pronouncement is prospective and has no effect on the company s financial position or results of operations as of december  environmental matters we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations 
the operation of dry cleaning facilities at our shopping centers is the principal environmental concern 
we require that the tenants who operate these facilities do so in material compliance with current laws and regulations and we have established procedures to monitor their operations 
additionally  we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers 
where available  we have applied and been accepted into state sponsored environmental programs 
several properties in our portfolio will require or are currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation 
however  we have environmental insurance policies covering all of our properties 
we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position  liquidity or operations 
inflation and recession considerations most of our leases contain provisions designed to partially mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
most of our leases require the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
a small number of our leases also include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rents based on a tenant s gross sales above predetermined levels  which sales generally increase as prices rise  or escalation clauses which are typically related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
our financial results are affected by general economic conditions in the markets in which our properties are located 
an economic recession  or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions  could result in the inability of some of our existing tenants to meet their lease obligations and could otherwise adversely affect our ability to attract or retain tenants 
supermarkets  drugstores and other anchor tenants that offer day to day necessities rather than luxury items anchor our existing properties 
these types of tenants  in our experience  generally maintain more consistent sales performance during periods of adverse economic conditions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk the primary market risk to which we have exposure is interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates can affect our net income and cash flows 
as changes in market conditions occur and interest rates increase or decrease  interest expense on the variable component of our debt will move in the same direction 
we intend to utilize variable rate indebtedness available under our unsecured revolving credit facilities in order to initially fund future acquisitions  development costs and for other operating needs 
with respect to our fixed rate mortgage notes and fixed rate senior unsecured notes  changes in interest rates generally do not affect our interest expense as these notes are predominantly at fixed rates for extended terms 
because we intend to hold our existing fixed rate obligations either to maturity or until the sale of the associated property  these fixed rate obligations do not pose an interest rate risk to our results of operations or our working capital position  except upon the refinancing of these obligations 
another possible risk is from increases in long term interest rates that may occur over a period of several years  as this may decrease the overall value of our real estate 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding floating rate debt  including million of fixed rate borrowings that we have converted to floating rate borrowings through the use of hedging agreements 
we do not believe that the interest rate risk represented by our floating rate debt is material as of december   in relation to our million of outstanding debt  our billion of total assets and the billion total market capitalization as of that date 
if interest rates on our variable rate debt increase by  the increase in annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
if interest rates on our variable rate debt decrease by  the decrease in interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
this assumes that the amount outstanding under our variable rate debt remains at approximately million including the million of fixed rate debt converted to floating rate debt through the use of hedging agreements  the balance as of december  the fair value of our fixed rate debt is million  which includes the mortgage notes and fixed rate portion of the senior unsecured notes payable excluding the unamortized premium discount 
if interest rates increase by  the fair value of our total fixed rate debt would decrease by approximately million 
if interest rates decrease by  the fair value of our total outstanding fixed rate debt would decrease by approximately  this assumes that our total outstanding fixed rate debt remains at million  the balance as of december  hedging activities to manage  or hedge  our exposure to interest rate risk  we follow established risk management policies and procedures  including the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
we require that the hedges or derivative financial instruments be effective in managing the interest rate risk exposure that they are designated to hedge 
this effectiveness is essential to qualify for hedge accounting 
hedges that meet these hedging criteria are formally designated as such at the inception of the contract 
when the terms of an underlying transaction are modified  or when the underlying hedged item ceases to exist  resulting in some ineffectiveness  the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument will be included in earnings 
additionally  any derivative instrument used for risk management that becomes ineffective is marked to market each period 
the company is exposed to credit risk  in the event of non performance by the counter parties to the hedge agreements 
the company believes that it mitigates its credit risk by entering into these agreements with major financial institutions 
net interest differentials to be paid or received under a swap contract and or collar agreement are included in interest expense as incurred or earned 
during  the company entered into a million notional principal variable rate interest swap with an estimated fair value of million at december  this swap converted fixed rate debt to variable rate based on the month libor in arrears plus  and matures april  the estimated fair value of the derivative financial instrument has been determined  using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies 
however  considerable judgment is necessarily required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the company could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value 
other market risks as of december   we had no material exposure to any other market risks including foreign currency exchange risk  commodity price risk or equity price risk 
for purposes of the securities and exchange commission s market risk disclosure requirements  we have estimated the fair value of our financial instruments at december  the fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information available to management as of december  although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts as of december   future estimates of fair value and the amounts which may be paid or realized in the future may differ significantly from amounts presented
