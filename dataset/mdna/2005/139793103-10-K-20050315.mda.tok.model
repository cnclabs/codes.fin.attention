overview 
capital bank is a full service state chartered community bank conducting business throughout north carolina 
the bank operates through four north carolina regions  triangle  sandhills  triad and western 
the bank was incorporated on may  and opened its first branch in june of that same year in raleigh 
in  the shareholders of the bank approved the reorganization of the bank into a bank holding company 
in  the company received approval to become a financial holding company 
in the third quarter of  the bank reintroduced non insured investment products and services through capital bank financial services a division of the bank  creating a partnership with capital investment group  a leading raleigh  north carolina based broker dealer 
the bank employs commission based financial advisors to offer full service brokerage to individual and corporate customers 
as of december   the company conducted no business other than holding stock in the bank and each of the trusts 
as a community bank  the bank s profitability depends primarily upon its levels of net interest income  which is the difference between interest income from interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
the bank s operations are also affected by its provision for loan losses  other operating income  and other operating expenses 
during  the company s focus was on the following priorities o strong  sustainable earnings o a sound credit culture o disciplined growth in existing or adjacent markets o unparalleled customer service by experienced community bankers for the year ended december   the company achieved record earnings as net income exceeded million for the first time in the company s history and net interest margin expanded basis points for the year 
nonperforming assets declined during the year and net charge offs declined significantly 
the company sold three branches in northern north carolina and opened locations in the higher growth markets of greensboro  wake forest and asheville 
the company believes our service worth talking about continues to enhance our customer experience in all communities we serve 
the company also strengthened its management team during the year appointing grant yarber as chief executive officer and hiring rick edwards as chief financial officer in april 
in addition  new executives were hired for the sandhills region and the mortgage division during the year 
the company believes it has an experienced management team that is dedicated to providing exceptional value to its customers and shareholders 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to the reserve for loan losses  investment and intangible asset values  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements o loan loss reserves the company records estimated loan loss reserves based on known problem loans and estimated risk in the existing loan portfolio 
the reserve calculation takes into account historic write off trends and current market and economic conditions 
if economic conditions were to decline significantly or the financial condition of the bank s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional reserves may be required 
o investments the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions and associated market values of investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
in addition  accounting standard setters are evaluating changes in accounting for unrealized losses on the company s investment portfolio which could require us to record and realize certain unrealized losses through earnings 
o valuation allowances the company assesses the need to record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company considers anticipated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for the valuation allowance which  at this time  it deems not to be necessary 
in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
o goodwill goodwill is not amortized  but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis at the reporting unit level 
identified intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis 
an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied value 
o impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  including identified intangible assets  are evaluated for impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
such evaluations are based on undiscounted cash flow projections 
the disposal of long lived assets is measured based on the lower of the book or fair value less the costs to sell 
results of operations 
the company reported net income of million   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on a fully diluted per share basis  net income for   and was   and  respectively 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between total interest income and total interest expense and is the company s principal source of earnings 
the amount of net interest income is determined by the volume of interest earning assets  the level of rates earned on those assets  and the volume and cost of supporting funds 
net interest income increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
the increase during the period is primarily due to increases in market rates on the bank s interest earning assets as its loans shifted upwards with increases in the prime rate and premium amortization slowed on its investment portfolio from lower prepayments 
over the last six months of  the federal reserve made five basis point bp upward adjustments in the open market committee s benchmark federal funds rate 
another bp increase occurred on february  since the bank s loan portfolio adjusts with prime at a faster rate than the time deposit portfolio  the increasing rate environment has had a positive effect on net interest spread and net interest margin 
as the time deposits mature and reprice  the margin could be negatively impacted based on pricing competition to retain these deposits 
in addition  the bank s net interest income was positively affected by a shift in the mix of its earning assets as the bank replaced lower yielding federal funds with higher yielding loans 
average federal funds and short term investments  yielding only in  dropped by million from december  to december  while average loans  yielding in  increased by almost million 
the increase in average loans takes into account the effect of the following two nonrecurring transactions that occurred during the period o the company completed the sale of its northern region branches in warrenton  seaboard and woodland to other financial institutions in september in those branch sales  the company sold approximately million of deposits and million of loans  as well as other assets 
the million of deposits sold were comprised of million non interest bearing demand  million of money market  savings and interest checking and million of time deposits 
a pre tax gain of million was recognized on the sale  which is included in non interest income 
o in december  the company sold approximately million of its mortgage loans 
in conjunction with this sale  a loss of  was recorded in non interest income 
a charge off of  associated with these loans was taken in the third quarter of for reserves previously established 
despite these significant transactions  both of which would have had negative effects on earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  average earning assets increased million from december  to december  and average interest bearing liabilities increased by million 
net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and other borrowed funds 
net interest margin is the total of net interest income divided by average earning assets 
average earning assets in were million  up when compared to million for the net interest margin was on a fully tax equivalent te basis in  a bp increase from the net interest margin of 
on a te basis  net interest spread was and for and  respectively 
interest income increased in to million from million in this increase is primarily due to the growth in the bank s loan portfolio and increases in overall yield as discussed above 
the average yield on interest earning assets for was  a bp increase from the yield of 
the average loan portfolio as a percentage of earning assets was in  up from the average balances of loans  which had yields of and for and  respectively  increased from million in to million in the average balances of federal funds and other short term investments decreased from million in to million in as these funds were used to fund loan growth  and the average yield in this category increased bps from to over the same time period 
investment yield increased on an te basis from in to in this increase reflects increases in market interest rates over the last year as mortgage backed security mbs pay downs have decreased from the prior year when the borrowers making up the underlying securities moved to refinance their mortgages 
increases in mbs payment speeds in the prior year accelerated the amortization of premiums associated with the assets and decreased the investment yield 
interest expense remained relatively flat from when measured against interest expense in both years was million 
average total interest bearing deposits  including savings  interest bearing demand deposits and time deposits declined slightly  from million in to million in  largely as a result of selling three branches which had deposits of million 
in addition  the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits declined bps between and as those customers with time deposits shortened up the terms on those deposits in anticipation of higher future rates 
the average rate on borrowings also declined from in to in this decline in a rising interest rate environment reflects the full year effect of interest rate swap agreements put into effect in july of which converted portions of the bank s fixed rate long term debt to a floating rate 
we would expect the cost of borrowings to increase in as rates continue to increase 
decreases in interest expense in the areas discussed above were offset by an increase in interest paid on subordinated debt associated with two trust preferred offerings done in the average outstanding balance of subordinated debt increased year over year from million in to million in  adding an additional  of interest expense as a result of the volume increase 
both subordinated debt issues are variable rate in nature and should increase in expense for the following two tables set forth certain information regarding the company s yield on interest earning assets and cost of interest bearing liabilities and the component changes in net interest income 
the first table reflects the company s effective yield on earning assets and cost of funds 
yields and costs are computed by dividing income or expense for the year by the respective daily average asset or liability balance 
changes in net interest income from year to year can be explained in terms of fluctuations in volume and rate

provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is the amount charged against earnings for the purpose of establishing an adequate allowance for loan losses 
loan losses are  in turn  charged to this allowance rather than being reported as a direct expense 
in and  amounts expensed as loan loss provisions were million and million  respectively 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses is established based on management s estimate of the inherent risks associated with lending activities  estimated fair value of collateral  past experience and present indicators such as delinquency rates and current market conditions 
the allowance is regularly reviewed and adjusted  as necessary 
loans of  or more are subject to specific review for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
the allowance for loan losses was million and million on december  and  respectively  and represented approximately and of total loans outstanding on those dates 
during the year  the company reclassified  of the allowance which related to loss exposure on unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit into a separate other liability account 
the company experienced higher loan charge offs during when compared to management believes that this was due in part to a weakened economy and in part to some large credit issues identified in the second quarter of as a result of those credit issues  management engaged two independent credit review firms in the latter part of to perform a detailed analysis of the bank s loan portfolio 
as a result of the review  management identified loans during that period aggregating approximately million that were classified as a loss 
in addition  management significantly increased its internal loan watch list 
during  the company charged off an aggregate of million in loans  net of  in recoveries 
of that amount  million related to five business customer relationships 
during  the company charged off an aggregate of million in loans  net of  in recoveries 
included in the charge offs for was  related to one loan that had been classified as impaired at december  and for which a specific reserve of  had been established at that time 
also as a result of the loan review  the company effected certain changes to try to mitigate such credit losses going forward  including procedural changes in the loan approval and credit review processes  changes in individual lending limits and centralization of the company s lending operations functions into one facility 
the company also added a lender support area where all consumer loans are centrally underwritten and approved 
management has allocated the allowance for loan losses by category  as shown in the following table 
this allocation is based on management s assessment of the risks associated with the different types of lending activities

the decreases were largely attributable to the resolution of the one impaired loan for which a specific reserve of  had been established 
the majority of our nonperforming loans are secured by real estate collateral which should mitigate our exposure to losses compared those loans that are unsecured or collateralized with other types of assets 
other operating income 
other operating income was million and million for years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in other operating income for is primarily attributable to a substantial drop in fee income recorded by the bank s mortgage department as a result of industry wide decreased mortgage refinance business caused by increases in mortgage loan interest rates 
mortgage origination fees fell to million for from the million earned in the twelve month period ended december  securities gains also fell during the period from  during the year ended december  to  during the same period of the mortgage revenue and securities gains decline between the two periods was partially offset by two significant non recurring transactions occurring in the third quarter of which were discussed previously 
fees associated with deposit accounts remained fairly flat year over year with recorded balances of million in both and the sale of the three mature branches impacted service charges in the latter part of as the sold branches had higher fee income than the newly opened branches 
total service charges and fees as a percent of the average total deposit base increased from 
in to 
in other operating expense 
other operating expense represents the costs of operating the company 
management regularly monitors all categories of other operating expense in an attempt to improve productivity and operating performance 
other operating expense decreased to million in from million in at december  there were branches and the average number of full time equivalent employees during the year was at december  there were branches and the average number of full time equivalent employees during the year was salary and employee benefits expense for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
commission expense decreased from million in to  in these commissions are driven largely by mortgage fee income which decreased 
in addition  during the company incurred million in severance expenses related to certain executive and senior officers who separated from the company compared to severance expenses during of only  occupancy expense increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily a result of lease expenses associated with new locations and additional space needed for expansion of existing departments 
furniture and equipment expense increased from million in to million in due to the increase in assets associated with the new locations and general expansion 
telecommunications expense increased from  to  as we added bandwidth for more rapid data communication 
the increased bandwidth was required to implement upgrades in the data processing software from its main data processing supplier 
public relations and advertising costs increased or  from  to  due to the branch openings and deposit campaign in other expenses decreased from million in to million in the primary cause for the decrease was a  write down in real estate owned made in september of there were no such significant real estate write downs in however  this decrease was partially offset by increases in other areas including increased travel and entertainment expenses from  to  and an increase in franchise taxes from  to  all such increases were a direct result of changes in the business plan of the company  the changing of the footprint of the organization  or expansion of existing departments 
provision for income taxes 
the company recorded an income tax expense of million in compared to  for the increase in income tax expense is primarily the result of a significant increase in pretax net income year over year 
pretax net income for was million compared to million for pretax net income for includes the effect of several large loan charge offs  increases to the loan loss provision and severance expenses as discussed above 
the overall effective rate adjusted upwards from in to in the rate for reflects the impact of permanent differences such as nontaxable municipal bond interest and insurance income on a smaller net income base 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note income taxes 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  net interest income 
net interest income increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
the increase during the period is primarily due to increases in the average volume of interest bearing assets and liabilities as the bank experienced internal growth 
the increase was negatively affected by a decline in market rates during rates dropped by bps in july in  the federal reserve held interest rates steady for a majority of the year  but made one move in november that resulted in an additional bp drop in the prime rate to 
in addition  during  the prime rate dropped from in january to in december with a decline in rates of at least bps in every month of except july as the federal reserve made separate moves to reduce interest rates in efforts to stimulate the economy 
the company felt the effects of these changes over an extended period of time due to the long term repricing or maturity dates of some of its assets and liabilities 
since the bank s loan portfolio adjusts with prime at a faster rate than the deposit portfolio  the declining rate environments had a negative effect on net interest spread and net interest margin 
average earning assets in were million  up when compared to million for the net interest margin was in  a bp decline from the net interest margin of 
net interest spread was and for and  respectively 
interest income increased in to million from million in this increase was primarily due to the growth in the bank s loan portfolio 
the average yield on interest earning assets for was  a decline of bps from the yield of 
the decrease in average yield during was primarily attributable to the overall decline in market rates as explained above 
the average loan portfolio as a percentage of earning assets was in  up from the average balances of loans  which had yields of and for and  respectively  increased from million in to million in the average balances of federal funds and other short term investments decreased from million in to million in  and the average yield in this category dropped bps from to over the same time period 
investment yield decreased from in to in this decrease reflects the results of the decline in market interest rates over the last three years as mbs pay downs increased significantly when the borrowers making up the underlying securities moved to refinance their mortgages 
increases in mbs payment speeds accelerated the amortization of premiums associated with the purchases and dropped the investment yield 
interest expense increased in to million from the million recorded during this increase was primarily due to a significant increase in average interest bearing deposits  which went from million in to million in in addition  average borrowed funds increased year over year from million in to million in also  during the company incurred junior subordinated debt associated with two trust preferred securities offerings 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note subordinated debentures 
the income effects of increases in volume were significantly offset by declines in rates during the period 
the average rates on interest bearing deposits decreased from in to in the decrease in average rates during is reflective of the overall decrease in market rates offered during as compared to the previous year 
as previously mentioned  the bank s loan portfolio adjusts with prime at a faster rate than its deposit portfolio as a result of the federal reserve s actions to decrease interest rates 
much of the effect of the rapid rate declines of did not take place on the deposit portfolio until and in particular  the average rate on time deposits  which represented of all interest bearing liabilities during  dropped bps in from in to in provision for loan losses 
in and  amounts expensed as loan loss provisions were million and million  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses was million and million on december  and  respectively  and represented approximately and of total loans outstanding on those dates 
the company experienced higher loan charge offs during when compared to the previous year 
management believes that this is due in part to a weakened economy and in part to some large credit issues identified in the second quarter of as a result of these credit issues  management engaged two independent credit review firms in the latter part of to perform a detailed analysis of the bank s loan portfolio 
as a result of the review  management identified loans during that period aggregating approximately million that were classified as a loss 
in addition  management significantly increased its internal loan watch list 
during  the company charged off an aggregate of million in loans  net of  in recoveries 
of that amount  million related to five business customer relationships 
during  the company charged off million in loans  net of  in recoveries 
also as a result of the loan review  the company effected certain changes to try to protect against such credit losses going forward  including procedural changes in the loan approval and credit review processes  changes in individual lending limits and centralization of the company s lending functions into one facility 
the company also added a lender support area where all consumer loans are centrally underwritten and approved 
other operating income 
other operating income was million and million for years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of 
the increase in other operating income for was primarily attributable to increases in fees associated with deposit accounts and a large increase in fees associated with the company s mortgage loan origination activities 
the large increase in fees associated with the mortgage loan origination activities was a direct result of attractive mortgage rates during and due to the lower interest rate environment 
mortgage loan origination fees increased from million during to million for fees associated with deposit accounts increased primarily as a result of the increased volume of average deposit accounts 
however  the total average deposit base increased from million in to million in service charges and fees increased from million in to million in total service charges and fees as a percent of the average total deposit base dropped from 
in to 
in finally  the company realized gains of  on the sale of investment securities during versus a realized gain of  in other operating expense 
other operating expense increased to million in from million in the increase in reflects a full year of expenses associated with the integration of the four additional branches in connection with the acquisition of first community corporation in january and three additional branches in connection with the acquisition of high street corporation in december at december  there were branches and the average number of full time equivalent employees was salary and employee benefits expense for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
increases were the result of additional personnel hired as new branches and departments were added or obtained through acquisition as discussed above 
in addition  during the company incurred million in severance expenses related to certain executive and senior officers who separated from the company 
commission expense increased from million in to million in because these commissions are driven by the underlying mortgage fee income  the increase   or  closely related to the increase in mortgage origination fees 
occupancy expense increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily a result of lease expenses associated with new locations and additional space needed for expansion of existing departments 
furniture and equipment expense increased from million in to million in due to the increase in these assets needed for the new locations and general expansion 
other operating expenses increased from million in to million in the increases in other operating expenses from to included a increase in telephone expenses from  to  a increase in postage from  to  and a increase in public relations and advertising costs from  to  in addition  courier costs  or those costs associated with getting customer transactions to the bank s outside processing center  increased due to the additional branches being serviced by such couriers 
all such increases were a direct result of a full year of expense on the new branches or expansion of existing departments 
in the third quarter of  the bank also incurred write downs of the carrying value of certain real estate held for sale of  provision for income taxes 
throughout  the company recorded income tax expenses of million 
the company recorded an income tax expense of  in the decrease in income tax expense was primarily the result of the loss recorded in the third quarter of and an overall drop in net taxable income 
the third quarter loss reflects the significant charge offs  the increase in the allowance for loan losses and the related loan loss provision recorded during that period 
the overall effective rate dropped from in to in that rate reflects the impact of permanent differences such as nontaxable municipal bond interest on a smaller net income base 
total permanent differences in were million in compared to  in the largest single component of this increase was an increase in municipal bond interest  which increased from  in to  in see notes to consolidated financial statements note income taxes for additional information on our tax expense 
financial condition 
the company s financial condition is measured in terms of its asset and liability composition  asset quality  capital resources  and liquidity 
the growth and composition of assets and liabilities during and reflect the repositioning of the company s markets and product lines as several branches were sold or closed  three new branches were opened  a large mortgage portfolio was sold and the company experienced internal growth as a result of its internal business development activities 
total assets were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in total assets of million in  or  reflects strong internal growth considering the fact that  while the company completed no acquisitions during  it did sell off approximately million in deposits and million in loans in two non routine transactions discussed previously 
the largest component of asset growth was the increase in loans 
total liabilities increased from million in to million in the main cause for the increase between the periods is an increase in time deposits of million as the company has used this source as its primary means to fund loan growth 
stockholders equity increased from million in to million in the increase  million or  primarily reflects an increase of million in retained earnings  comprised of million of net income less dividends of million 
common stock increased  largely the result of issuances of stock pursuant to stock options exercises 
assets cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents  including non interest bearing and interest bearing cash and federal funds sold  decreased from million in to million in the decrease is primarily the result of growth in loans and the outlay of cash needed to fund those loans exceeding growth in deposits and borrowings 
loan portfolio 
total loans were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
loan growth  excluding the branch sale and mortgage portfolio sold previously discussed  was million or annualized 
the increase was the result of internal growth as the company completed no acquisitions in and reflects improvement in our operations during accordingly  the company s business development activities were key factors in the growth of the loan portfolio during at december   commercial loans  mortgage loans  consumer loans  and equity lines were million  million  million  and million  respectively 
at december   commercial loans  mortgage loans  consumer loans  and equity lines were million  million  million  and million  respectively 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note loans and allowances for loan losses 
the commercial loan portfolio is comprised mainly of loans to small and mid sized businesses with revenues up to million 
there were no significant concentrations of credit to any one industry  class  or category 
the following table reflects the maturities of the commercial loan portfolio and the mix of the commercial loans that mature greater than one year in the loan portfolio between fixed rate and adjustable rate notes 
dollars in thousands commercial loans due within one year  due one through five years  due after five years  commercial loans due after year fixed rate  variable rate  although there were no large concentrations of credit to any particular industry  the economic trends of the area served by the company are influenced by the significant industries within the region 
the company s primary business activity is with customers located in the research triangle area of north carolina raleigh  durham  and chapel hill and its surrounding counties  the alamance county area burlington and graham  north carolina  and the interstate corridor between asheville and hickory  north carolina 
the ultimate collectibility of the company s loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in the market conditions of these geographic regions 
the company uses a centralized risk management process to ensure uniform credit underwriting that adheres to company policy 
lending policies are reviewed on a regular basis to confirm that the company is prudent in setting its underwriting criteria 
credit risk is managed through a number of methods including loan grading of commercial loans  committee approval of larger loans  and class and purpose coding of loans 
management believes that early detection of credit problems through regular contact with the company s customers coupled with consistent reviews of the borrowers financial condition are important factors in overall credit risk management 
management charged off loans totaling million  million  and million net of recoveries  as uncollectible during  and  respectively 
the large increase in the amount was the result of five large commercial loan relationships that totaled million  or of the total amount charged off  as well as continued softening in the economy and isolated instances of specific business problems 
at december  and  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was and  respectively 
management believes the allowance for loan losses of million at provides adequate coverage of the probable losses in the loan portfolio 
investment securities 
investment securities represent the second largest component of earning assets 
the company s securities portfolio consists primarily of debt securities issued by us government agencies and securities issued by fannie mae and freddie mac which have been segregated into one of two categories available for sale or held to maturity 
the available for sale classification allows flexibility in the management of interest rate risk  liquidity  and loan portfolio growth while the held to maturity classification protects the balance sheet against market value fluctuations in a rising rate environment 
the company has the intent and the ability to hold held to maturity securities until their maturity or prepayment 
securities available for sale are carried at their fair value and the mark to market adjustment was  in net unrealized gains at december  after considering applicable tax benefits  the mark to market adjustment increased total stockholders equity by  future fluctuations in stockholders equity may occur due to changes in the fair values of available for sale securities 
growth of the investment securities portfolio in will depend on loan growth  the interest rates available for reinvesting maturing securities and changes in the interest rate yield curve 
due to an expected rising interest rate environment  the company may curtail or refrain from the reinvestment of cash flows from its investment portfolio  instead using proceeds to pay off wholesale funding liabilities and deleveraging the balance sheet thereby improving capital ratios but lowering net interest income 
the company may also increase the investment portfolio depending on core deposit growth 
on december  and  the recorded value of investments totaled million and million  respectively 
at december   million of these securities were classified as available for sale and recorded at market value and million were classified as held to maturity and recorded at amortized cost 
at december   all investments were classified as available for sale 
the company has reviewed the investment portfolio and has not recorded any other than temporary impairment 
the company anticipates that substantially all of the book value of the investments will be recovered over the life of any securities whose market value is below amortized cost

money market investments and federal funds 
at december  and  the company had  and million  respectively  in short term money market investments and federal funds 
these figures include interest bearing cash accounts 
the decrease between the periods was the result of a need to use interest earning cash and fed funds to fund a growth in loans during a period when deposits were declining 
deposits 
total deposits increased from million at december  to million at december  of these amounts  million and million were in the form of non interest bearing demand deposits at december  and  respectively  and million and million were in the form of interest bearing deposits at december  and  respectively 
balances in certificates of deposit of  and over were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the largest area of growth was in brokered deposits  which grew from million at december  to million at december  as the company used this form of wholesale funding to fund loan growth during the year and to replace funding provided by the three sold branches 
the following table reflects the maturities of certificates of deposit of  and over as of december  maturity average dollars in thousands amount rate three months or less  over three months to six months  over six months to twelve months  over twelve months  debt

the company had average outstanding fhlb advances of million and million with effective costs of borrowing of and at december  and  respectively 
at december   approximately million are fixed rate advances and million are variable rate advances including million of long term advances for which the fixed interest rate has been converted to a variable rate through interest rate swaps discussed below 
capital resources 
total shareholders equity for and  excluding unrealized gains net of taxes on available for sale securities of  in and  in  was million and million  respectively 
the increase is primarily the result of the change in retained earnings  comprised of million of net income less dividends of million 
common stock increased  largely the result of issuances of stock pursuant to stock options exercises 
the company paid cash dividends of per share during and per share during at december   the company had a leverage ratio of  a tier capital ratio of  and a risk based capital ratio of 
these ratios exceed the federal regulatory minimum requirements for a well capitalized bank and increased from year end levels 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note regulatory matters and restrictions for additional information on regulatory capital requirements 
the board of directors has also authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock through public or private transactions 
the company did not repurchase any shares in management plans to utilize share repurchases to manage the capital levels of the company 
subsequent to year end  we repurchased  shares at an average cost of per share 
asset liability management 
asset liability management functions to maximize profitability within established guidelines for interest rate risk  liquidity  and capital adequacy 
measurement and monitoring of liquidity  interest rate risk  and capital adequacy are performed centrally through the asset liability management committee  and reported under guidelines established by management  the board of directors and regulators 
oversight on asset liability management matters is provided by the board of directors through its asset liability management committee 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for information about interest rate risk 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
to ensure the company is positioned to meet immediate and future cash demands  management relies on internal analysis of its liquidity  knowledge of current economic and market trends and forecasts of future conditions 
regulatory agencies set certain minimum liquidity standards including the setting of a reserve requirement by the federal reserve 
the company must submit weekly reports to the federal reserve to ensure that it meets those requirements 
at december   the company met all of its liquidity requirements 
the company had million in its most liquid assets  cash and cash equivalents at december  the company s principal sources of funds are deposits  short term borrowings and capital 
core deposits total deposits less certificates of deposits in the amount of  or more  one of the most stable sources of liquidity  together with equity capital funded million or of total assets at december  at december   core deposits and equity capital totaled million or of total assets 
the company s liquidity can best be demonstrated by an analysis of its cash flows 
in  the company used a net increase in deposits of million to fund million in net new internal loan growth 
excluding the effect of million in deposits sold and million in loans sold as a result of the sale of three branches in the third quarter and million in loans sold related to a specific loan portfolio  net deposit growth was million and net loans funded was million 
in addition  the company had other financing activities including net repayment of borrowings from the fhlb of million 
operating activities also provided million of liquidity for the year ended december   compared to million and  in and  respectively 
the principal elements of operating activities are net income  increased for significant non cash expenses for the provision for loan losses and depreciation and amortization 
a secondary source of liquidity for the company comes from investing activities  principally the sales of  maturities of and cash flows from investment securities 
during and  due to the declining interest rate environment  the cash flow from mortgage backed securities accelerated as borrowers holding the underlying mortgages refinanced and certain securities with call features were called 
the cash received from these events  combined with maturities  amounted to million and million in and  respectively 
as rates began to rise  the refinance market slowed down and with it  the cash flow from the mortgage backed securities declined 
repayments on these obligations in were million 
as of december   the company had negligible investment securities that would mature in the next months  although certain mbs securities will have principal reductions and agency securities may be called by the issuer 
during  the company purchased million of investment securities to replace the securities sold  called or matured during the same period and to meet liquidity needs 
additional sources of liquidity are available to the bank through the federal reserve system and through membership in the fhlb system 
as of december   the bank had a maximum borrowing capacity of million through the fhlb of atlanta 
these funds can be made available with various maturities and interest rate structures 
borrowings cannot exceed twenty percent of total assets or twenty times the amount of fhlb stock owned by the borrowing bank 
at december   the bank owned million worth of fhlb stock or percent of its outstanding advances of million 
borrowings are collateralized by a blanket lien by the fhlb on the bank s qualifying assets 
the company also has sources of liquidity from other sources such as federal funds lines  repurchased agreement lines and brokered cds 
these liquidity sources require collateral in the case of repurchase agreements but are generally unsecured or easily utilized by the company 
the following table reflects expected maturities of contractual obligations and expected expirations of ongoing commitments that affect the company s liquidity

the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historic dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the rate of inflation has been relatively moderate over the past few years  however  the effect of inflation on interest rates can materially impact bank operations  which rely on the spread between the yield on earning assets and rates paid on deposits and borrowings as the major source of earnings 
operating costs  such as salaries and wages  occupancy and equipment costs  can also be negatively impacted by inflation 
risk factors in addition to the other information provided in this annual report of form k  you should consider the following material risk factors carefully before deciding to invest in the company s securities 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company  that the company currently deems not material or that are similar to those faced by other companies in the company s industry or business in general  such as competitive conditions  may also impact the company s business operations 
if any of the events described below occur  our business  financial condition  or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in that event  the trading price of the company s common stock may decline  in which case the value of your investment may decline as well 
our results are impacted by the economic conditions of our principal operating regions our operations are concentrated throughout central and western north carolina 
as a result of this geographic concentration  our results may correlate to the economic conditions in these areas 
deterioration in economic conditions in any of these market areas  particularly in the industries on which these geographic areas depend  may adversely affect the quality of our loan portfolio and the demand for our products and services  and accordingly  our results of operations 
we are exposed to risks in connection with the loans we make a significant source of risk for us arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers  guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans 
we have underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and credit policies  including the establishment and review of the allowance for loan losses  that we believe are appropriate to minimize this risk by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance  tracking loan performance and diversifying our loan portfolio 
such policies and procedures  however  may not prevent unexpected losses that could adversely affect our results of operations 
we compete with larger companies for business the banking and financial services business in our market areas continues to be a competitive field and is becoming more competitive as a result of o changes in regulations  o changes in technology and product delivery systems  and o the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers 
we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets  and our results of operations could be adversely affected by the nature or pace of change in competition 
we compete for loans  deposits and customers with various bank and nonbank financial services providers  many of which have substantially greater resources including higher total assets and capitalization  greater access to capital markets and a broader offering of financial services 
our trading volume has been low compared with larger banks the trading volume in the company s common stock on the nasdaq national market has been comparable to other similarly sized banks 
nevertheless  this trading is relatively low when compared with more seasoned companies listed on the nasdaq national market or other consolidated reporting systems or stock exchanges 
thus  the market in the company s common stock may be limited in scope relative to other companies 
we depend heavily on our key management personnel the company s success depends in part on its ability to retain key executives and to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel who have experience both in sophisticated banking matters and in operating a small to mid size bank 
competition for such personnel is strong in the banking industry and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining the personnel we require 
we expect to effectively compete in this area by offering financial packages that include incentive based compensation and the opportunity to join in the rewarding work of building a growing bank 
technological advances impact our business the banking industry is undergoing technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
in addition to improving customer services  the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or successfully market such products and services to our customers 
government regulations may prevent or impair our ability to pay dividends  engage in acquisitions or operate in other ways current and future legislation and the policies established by federal and state regulatory authorities will affect our operations 
we are subject to supervision and periodic examination by the federal deposit insurance corporation and the north carolina state banking commission 
banking regulations  designed primarily for the protection of depositors  may limit our growth and the return to you  our investors  by restricting certain of our activities  such as o the payment of dividends to our shareholders  o possible mergers with or acquisitions of or by other institutions  o our desired investments  o loans and interest rates on loans  o interest rates paid on our deposits  o the possible expansion of our branch offices  and or o our ability to provide securities or trust services 
we also are subject to capitalization guidelines set forth in federal legislation  and could be subject to enforcement actions to the extent that we are found by regulatory examiners to be undercapitalized 
we cannot predict what changes  if any  will be made to existing federal and state legislation and regulations or the effect that such changes may have on our future business and earnings prospects 
the cost of compliance with regulatory requirements including those imposed by the securities and exchange commission may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably 
there are potential risks associated with future acquisitions and expansions we intend to continue to explore expanding our branch system through selective acquisitions of existing banks or bank branches in the research triangle area and other north carolina markets 
we cannot say with any certainty that we will be able to consummate  or if consummated  successfully integrate  future acquisitions  or that we will not incur disruptions or unexpected expenses in integrating such acquisitions 
in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate potential acquisitions that would bolster our ability to cater to the small business  individual and residential lending markets in north carolina 
in attempting to make such acquisitions  we anticipate competing with other financial institutions  many of which have greater financial and operational resources 
in addition  since the consideration for an acquired bank or branch may involve cash  notes or the issuance of shares of common stock  existing shareholders could experience dilution in the value of their shares of our common stock in connection with such acquisitions 
any given acquisition  if and when consummated  may adversely affect our results of operations or overall financial condition 
in addition  we may expand our branch network through de novo branches in existing or new markets 
these de novo branches will have expenses in excess of revenues for varying periods after opening which could decrease our reported earnings 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional risks and expenses changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of and new sec regulations  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours 
these laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases  and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies  which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  our efforts to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased expenses and a diversion of management time and attention 
in particular  our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related regulations regarding management s required assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and our external auditors audit of that assessment has required the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
we expect these efforts to require the continued commitment of significant resources 
further  the members of our board of directors  members of the audit or compensation committees  our chief executive officer  our chief financial officer and certain other of our executive officers could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties 
as a result  our ability to attract and retain executive officers and qualified board and committee members could be more difficult 
in addition  it may become more difficult and more expensive to obtain director and officer liability insurance

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company hopes to reach its strategic financial objectives through the effective management of market risk 
like many financial institutions  the company s most significant market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the company s primary goal in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the effect that changes in interest rates have on interest income and expense 
this is accomplished through the active management of asset and liability portfolios  which includes the strategic pricing of asset and liability accounts and ensuring a proper maturity combination of assets and liabilities 
the goal of these activities is the development of maturity and repricing opportunities in the company s portfolios of assets and liabilities that will produce consistent net interest income during periods of changing interest rates 
the company s asset liability committee alco  made up of members of management and the board  monitors loan  investment  and liability portfolios to ensure comprehensive management of interest rate risk 
these portfolios are analyzed to ensure proper fixed and variable rate mixes under several interest rate scenarios 
the asset liability management process is intended to accomplish relatively stable net interest margins and assure liquidity by coordinating the amounts  maturities  or repricing opportunities of earning assets  deposits  and borrowed funds 
the alco has the responsibility to determine and achieve the most appropriate volume and combination of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and ensure an adequate level of liquidity and capital  within the context of corporate performance objectives 
the alco also sets policy guidelines and establishes long term strategies with respect to interest rate risk exposure and liquidity 
the alco meets regularly to review the company s interest rate risk and liquidity positions in relation to present and prospective market and business conditions  and adopts balance sheet management strategies intended to ensure that the potential impact of earnings and liquidity as a result of fluctuations in interest rates is within acceptable guidelines 
in  the bank began using financial instruments  commonly known as derivatives  to manage various financial risks 
the derivatives used presently by the bank consist of interest rate swaps and swaptions 
a derivative is a financial instrument that derives its cash flows  and therefore its value  by reference to an underlying instrument  index  or referenced interest rate 
the bank uses derivatives to hedge its interest bearing liabilities 
these hedges resulted in a net increase in net interest income of  in and  in the company anticipates the benefit to net interest income of the swaps and swaptions will decrease in as short term interest rates continue to increase 
derivative contracts are written in amounts referred to as notional amounts 
notional amounts only provide the basis for calculating payments between counterparties and do not represent amounts to be exchanged between parties and are not a measure of financial risk 
on december   the bank had derivative financial instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling million 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note derivative financial instruments for additional information 
as a financial institution  most of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
this differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies balance sheets  which are comprised primarily of fixed assets or inventories 
movements in interest rates and actions of the board of governors of the federal reserve system frb to regulate the availability and cost of credit have a greater effect on a financial institution s profitability than do the effects of higher costs for goods and services 
through its balance sheet management function  which is monitored by the alco  the company is positioned to respond to changing needs for liquidity  changes in interest rates and inflationary trends 
the company utilizes an outside asset liability management advisory firm to help management evaluate interest rate risk and develop asset liability management strategies 
one tool used is a computer simulation model which projects the company s performance under different interest rate scenarios 
analyses are prepared quarterly which evaluate the company s performance in a base strategy that reflects the company s and operating plan 
three interest rate scenarios flat  rising and declining are applied to the base strategy to determine the effect of changing interest rates on net interest income 
the december  analysis indicates that interest rate risk exposure over a twelve month time horizon is within the guidelines established by the board of directors 
the company s interest rate sensitivity is illustrated in the following table 
the company continues to be asset sensitive at december  as its assets reprice faster than its liabilities 
the table reflects rate sensitive positions at december   and is not necessarily indicative of positions on other dates 
the carrying amounts of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are presented in the periods in which they next reprice to market rates or mature and are aggregated to show the interest rate sensitivity gap 
to reflect anticipated prepayments  certain asset and liability categories are shown in the table using estimated cash flows rather than contractual cash flows

in the rising rate scenario  which contemplates a bp increase in interest rates over a twelve month period  the company is expected to see its annualized net interest income improve by million  or 
conversely  the company will see a decline in net interest income of  or  if rates decline bps  as is contemplated in the declining rate scenario 
the table does not reflect the impact of the hedging strategies mentioned above 
these interest rate hedges  accounted for as fair value hedges  were designed to convert million of long term advances from fixed rates to a variable rate which is reset quarterly based on libor 
the swaps are collateralized by certain investment securities and mature as follows effective year amount variable rate  libor  libor
