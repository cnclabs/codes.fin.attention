table of contents insurance although we believe our properties are adequately covered by insurance  we cannot predict at this time if we will be able to obtain appropriate coverage at a reasonable cost in the future 
our insurance costs have fluctuated significantly in recent years  increasing significantly in mid  while decreasing in connection with our renewal 
in  the terrorism risk insurance act of tria  was enacted and mandated that insurance carriers offer insurance covering physical damage from terrorist incidents certified by the united states government as foreign terrorist acts 
under tria  the united states government will reimburse insurance carriers  subject to certain deductibles  for up to of any claims from such certified terrorist acts  subject to an overall cap 
tria permits insurance carriers to exclude losses due to biological  chemical or radioactive contamination 
in may  we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company which provides million in coverage against losses due solely to biological  chemical or radioactive contamination arising out of a certified terrorist act 
in the event of a covered loss  we expect our captive insurance company to recover of its losses  less certain deductibles  from the united states government  but it has not reinsured its remaining exposure and may have insufficient capital to fully pay our claim 
in  due to the rising cost of california earthquake insurance  we reviewed our probable maximum loss pml and industry practice related to earthquake coverage for various factors 
as a result of this review  we determined that it was possible to lower our earthquake coverage from million to million 
we believe this will be sufficient coverage but there can be no assurance that such coverage will adequately compensate us for any loss  that our coverage would continue after a loss  or that a loss  even if covered  would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations

item legal proceedings hq global stockholders we are currently involved in a lawsuit filed in april by two stockholders of hq global arising out of the june merger transaction involving hq global and vantas incorporated 
these two stockholders originally brought claims against hq global  the board of directors of hq global  frontline capital group and us in delaware chancery court 
the two stockholders allege that  in connection with the merger transaction  we breached our fiduciary duties to the two stockholders and breached a contract with the stockholders 
the claim relates principally to the allocation of consideration paid to us with respect to our interest in an affiliate of hq global that conducted international executive suites operations 
the stockholders asked the court to rescind the transaction  or in the alternative to award compensatory and rescissory damages 
the court determined that it would not rescind the merger transaction  but held open the possibility that compensatory damages could be awarded or that another equitable remedy might be available 
in connection with the hq global vantas merger transaction  we agreed to indemnify all of the individuals who served as directors of hq global at the time of the transaction  including oliver t 
carr  jr 
who 
table of contents retired from our board of directors as of april   thomas a 
carr and philip l 
hawkins  who currently serve as directors and executive officers of us  with respect to any losses incurred by them arising out of the above litigation as well as related litigation that was resolved in our favor in the second quarter of  if they first tried and were unsuccessful in getting the losses reimbursed by hq global or from insurance proceeds 
it was expected at the time that these former directors would be indemnified against any of these losses by hq global  as required by hq global s certificate of incorporation and bylaws 
hq global indicated that it did not intend to satisfy its indemnity obligation to these directors 
as a result  we have paid the costs incurred by these directors in connection with the above litigation 
we have paid approximately  of costs pursuant to this indemnification arrangement  all of which represents amounts paid to legal counsel for these directors for this suit and the related litigation that was resolved in our favor in the second quarter of the directors of hq global involved in the delaware litigation filed a proof of claim in the company s bankruptcy proceedings for their legal fees 
a settlement of this claim was reached on june  in pertinent part  pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement  the parties i executed a mutual release of claims  ii agreed that the directors will be deemed to hold collectively a single allowed unsecured non priority claim in the amount of  against the estate of hq global  and iii preserved the rights of the directors to pursue claims  if any  they may have against hq global s insurance carriers which have denied coverage for the claims in the delaware litigation 
this settlement has been approved by the bankruptcy court 
we do not expect to receive any material proceeds as a result of the directors settlement of their proof of claim 
we believe that these claims  including those asserted against us and against the former directors who we are obligated to indemnify  are without merit and that we and the former directors will ultimately prevail in this action  although we cannot assure you that the court will not find in favor of these stockholders 
if the court did find in favor of these stockholders  such adverse result or any indemnification obligation arising from such adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
currently  these stockholders have not asserted the amount of any potential damages and  based on the preliminary proceedings to date  we are unable to determine a potential range of loss with respect to the claims against us or the former directors 
other proceedings we are party to a variety of other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
all of these matters  taken together  are not expected to have a material adverse impact on us

part ii item market for registrant s common equity related stockholder matters our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange nyse under the symbol cre 
as of december   there were stockholders of record 
the following table sets forth the high and low sale prices of our common stock as reported on the nyse composite tape  and the dividends paid per share of common stock for each quarterly period for the past two years 
q q q q full year high low dividend q q q q full year high low dividend 
table of contents in order to qualify as a reit  we are required to make ordinary dividend distributions to our stockholders 
the amount of these distributions must equal at least i 
the sum of a of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and b of the net income after tax  if any  from foreclosure property  minus ii 
the sum of certain non cash income items 
for federal income tax purposes  distributions may consist of ordinary income  capital gains  nontaxable return of capital or a combination of those items 
distributions that exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits calculated for tax purposes constitute a return of capital rather than a dividend  which reduces a stockholder s basis in the shares of common stock and will not be taxable to the extent that the distribution equals or is less than the stockholder s basis in the stock 
to the extent a distribution exceeds both current and accumulated earnings and profits and the stockholder s basis in the stock  that distribution will be treated as a gain from the sale or exchange of that stockholder s shares 
every year  we notify stockholders of the taxability of distributions paid during the preceding year 
the following table sets forth the approximate taxability of common stock distributions paid in   and ordinary income non taxable distribution cash flows from operations are an important factor in our ability to sustain our dividend at its current rate 
cash flows from operations increased slightly from million in to million in we expect our cash flows from operations to be lower in than and tenant improvements are expected to remain at elevated levels as a result of factors mentioned in the introduction to our management s discussion and analysis  including but not limited to  lower expected lease termination fees  continued declines in rental rates compared to the rates on expiring leases and costs associated with a new lease in washington  dc for approximately  rentable square feet 
this lease requires the space to be taken out of service for a period of two to four months for remodeling for the new tenant  includes eight months of abated rent and requires significant capital investment in tenant improvements and lease commissions 
we expect that these factors will negatively impact our cash flow from operations and our ability to cover our current common stock dividend payment level using cash flows from operations 
we currently expect to maintain our common stock dividend rate of per quarter in as a result  we may need to borrow under our line of credit or sell assets in order to maintain our common stock dividend at the current rate 
there can be no assurance that circumstances may not change and as a result of poorer than expected operating results or the inability to obtain financing on favorable terms  or at all  that we will not later reduce our common stock dividend below the current rate 
we generally are restricted from paying dividends that would exceed of our funds from operations during any four quarter period

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the discussion that follows is based primarily on our consolidated financial statements as of december  and  and for the years ended december   and and should be read along with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the ability to compare one period to another may be significantly affected by acquisitions completed  development properties placed in service and dispositions made during those years 
the number of operating office buildings that we owned and were consolidated in the financial statements were in  in and in as a result of the weak economic climate over the last several years  the office real estate markets were materially affected 
the contraction of office workforces reduced demand for office space and overall vacancy rates for office properties increased in all of our markets through and our operations were adversely impacted 
in  vacancy rates appeared to peak in many of our markets and some positive net absorption of space started to occur 
in  the positive trend of reduced vacancy rates and positive net absorption continued in most of our markets 
as a result of improved job growth  leasing activity is up significantly  and we believe that market rental rates have stabilized in all of our markets and are beginning to improve in some of our markets including washington  d 
c and southern california 
rental economics are expected to improve in most of our markets by the end of due to the improving market conditions described above and the elimination of most of our poor credit quality tenants through lease defaults and terminations in the last few years  we believe that our average occupancy in most markets stabilized in the second half of our occupancy in the portfolio of operating properties increased to at december  compared to at december  and at december  if demand continues to improve in  we expect that our overall portfolio average occupancy may improve further 
our occupancy improved slightly in over due to acquisitions of properties with higher occupancies and dispositions of certain low occupancy properties 
our same store properties we owned in both years occupancy was in compared to in  although same store occupancy began to improve in the second half of increasing from at june  to at december  in connection with terminating tenants in  we earned million of termination fees 
these fees are non recurring in nature and while we expect we will earn modest termination fees in  we expect that they will be substantially lower than in rental rates on space that was re leased in decreased an average of in comparison to rates that were in effect under expiring leases 
while market rental rates have stabilized in our markets  rental rates on in place leases in certain markets remain significantly above current market rental rates 
we estimate that market rental rates on leased space expiring in will be  on average  approximately lower than straight lined rents on expiring leases 
we have million square feet of space on which leases are currently scheduled to expire in we expect real estate service revenue to be significantly lower in than due to lower development and leasing fees 
during and continuing in  we experienced increases in tenant improvement and leasing costs as compared to historical levels as a result of competitive market conditions 
we expect that tenant improvements will continue at high levels in due to continuing competitive market conditions 
additionally  we expect to incur unusually high levels of tenant improvements and lease commissions due to the commencement of a  square foot lease in washington  dc in connection with this lease  we expect to incur million of tenant improvements and lease commissions in with additional amounts being incurred in the existing tenant will vacate the space on june  and this space will be taken out of service during the period required to prepare the space for the new tenant  which we estimate to be between two and four months 
in addition to high levels of tenant improvements and commissions  we will not recognize any revenue from the new lease during the period the space is not in service 

table of contents in december  our board of directors approved a plan to restructure the manner in which we hold our assets by converting to what is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership reit  or upreit  structure 
to effect the upreit restructuring  we formed carramerica realty operating partnership  lp  or the operating partnership  to which we contributed substantially all of our assets on june  in exchange for of the units of common and preferred partnership interest in the operating partnership and the assumption by the operating partnership of substantially all of our liabilities  including the assumption of the obligations under our unsecured credit facility and our senior unsecured notes 
at december   we owned all of the outstanding units of partnership interest of the operating partnership 
since the upreit restructuring  substantially all of our business is being conducted through the operating partnership and our primary asset is our interest in the operating partnership 
we undertook the upreit restructuring to enable us to better compete with other office reits  many of which are structured as upreits  for the acquisition of properties from tax motivated sellers 
as a result of the upreit restructuring  the operating partnership can issue units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership to tax motivated sellers who contribute properties to the operating partnership  thereby enabling those sellers to realize certain tax benefits that would be unavailable if we purchased properties directly for cash 
general during we completed the following significant transactions we issued million principal amount of senior unsecured notes in march with net proceeds of approximately million which were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our unsecured line of credit 
the notes mature on april  we entered into a million interest rate swap in connection with the issuance of the senior unsecured notes which qualifies for fair value hedge accounting 
we issued million principal amount of senior unsecured notes in august with net proceeds of approximately million which were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our unsecured line of credit 
the notes mature on september  we retired million of senior unsecured notes with proceeds from our unsecured line of credit 
we disposed of operating properties buildings generating net proceeds of approximately million 
a joint venture in which we are partner disposed of an operating property generating net proceeds to the joint venture of million 
we purchased operating properties buildings with million rentable square feet for million 
we acquired for million a interest in a joint venture which purchased operating properties and land 
we entered into a three year million unsecured revolving credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank as administrative agent for a syndicate of banks 
we completed our upreit conversion in june during  we completed the following significant transactions we repurchased  shares of our common stock for approximately million 
we redeemed million shares of our series b  c and d redeemable preferred stock for million excluding dividends 
we disposed of five operating properties and one parcel of land generating net proceeds of approximately million 
we acquired interests in four operating properties  directly or through joint ventures  for an aggregate investment of million  including assumed debt 
we issued million shares of preferred stock for net proceeds of approximately million 

table of contents during  we completed the following significant transactions we acquired five operating properties for an aggregate purchase prices of approximately million including assumed debt 
we disposed of four operating properties one owned through a joint venture for aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
our critical accounting policies and estimates relate to estimating the depreciable lives of assets  evaluating the impairment of long lived assets and investments  allocating the purchase cost of acquired properties  assessing our probable liability under lease guarantees for hq global workplaces  inc hq global and evaluating the collectibility of accounts receivable 
depreciation of rental properties is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated lives of our assets by class are as follows base building to years building components to years tenant improvements lesser of the terms of the leases or useful lives of the assets furniture  fixtures and equipment to years we make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our assets 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income 
should we lengthen the expected useful life of an asset  it would be depreciated over a longer period  resulting in less depreciation expense and higher annual net income 
should we shorten the expected useful life of an asset  it would be depreciated over a shorter period  resulting in more depreciation expense and lower annual net income 
we assess the carrying value of our long lived assets on a regular basis 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a rental property to be held and used or land held for development may be impaired  we perform a recoverability analysis based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the property in the future 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  the property and related assets  such as tenant improvements  lease commissions and in place lease intangibles  are written down to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
if we decide to sell rental properties or land holdings  we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of the assets 
if the evaluation indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from estimated net sales proceeds  the property and related assets are written down to estimated fair value less costs to sell and an impairment loss is recognized 
our estimates of cash flows and fair values of the properties are based on current market conditions and consider matters such as rental rates and occupancies for comparable properties  recent sales data for comparable properties and  where applicable  contracts or the results of negotiations with purchasers or prospective purchasers 
changes in estimated future cash flows due to changes in our plans or views of market and economic conditions could result in recognition of additional impairment losses which  under applicable accounting guidance  could be substantial 
we allocate the purchase cost of acquired properties to the related physical assets and in place leases based on their fair values 
the fair values of acquired office buildings are determined on an if vacant basis considering a variety of factors  including the physical condition and quality of the buildings  estimated rental and absorption rates  estimated future cash flows and valuation assumptions consistent with current market conditions 
the if vacant fair value is allocated to land  where applicable  buildings  tenant improvements and equipment based on property tax assessments and other relevant information obtained in connection with the acquisition of the property 
the fair value of in place leases includes the effect of leases with above or below market rents  where applicable  customer relationship value and the cost of acquiring existing tenants at the date of acquisition 
above market and below market in place lease values are determined on a lease by lease basis based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between a the 
table of contents contractual amounts to be paid under the lease and b our estimate of the fair market lease rate for the corresponding space over the remaining non cancellable terms of the related leases 
the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental revenue over the initial term and any below market renewal periods of the related leases 
capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a decrease to rental revenue over the initial term of the related leases 
customer relationship values are determined based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and our overall relationship with the tenant 
characteristics we consider include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant  prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
the value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the lesser of the initial lease term and any expected renewal periods or the remaining useful life of the building 
we determine the fair value of the cost of acquiring existing tenants by estimating the lease commissions avoided by having in place tenants and the avoided lost operating income for the estimated period required to lease the space occupied by existing tenants at the acquisition date 
the cost of acquiring existing tenants is amortized to expense over the initial term of the respective leases 
should a tenant terminate its lease early  the unamortized portion of the in place lease value is charged to expense 
changes in the assumptions used in the allocation of the purchase cost among the acquired assets would affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses 
as a result of the bankruptcy of hq global  we were required to make estimates regarding our probable liability under guarantees of hq global s performance under four office leases 
after carefully evaluating the facts and circumstances of each property and developments in the bankruptcy proceedings  we accrued a loss of million in  our best estimate of the probable liability related to these guarantees 
our estimated loss was based on such factors as the expected period of vacancy for the space before it could be relet  expected rental rates and other factors 
circumstances surrounding these guarantees changed and we accrued a net additional loss of million in the third quarter of our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is established based on analysis of the risk of loss on specific accounts 
the analysis places particular emphasis on past due accounts and considers information such as the nature and age of the receivable  the payment history of the tenant or other debtor  the amount of security we hold  the financial condition of the tenant and our assessment of its ability to meet its lease obligations  the basis for any disputes and the status of related negotiations  etc 
our estimate of the required allowance  which is reviewed on a quarterly basis  is subject to revision as these factors change and is sensitive to the effects of economic and market conditions on our tenants  particularly in our largest markets ie  the san francisco bay and washington  ie metro areas 
we increased our provision for uncollectible accounts and related accrued straight line rents by approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease in the addition to our provision for uncollectible accounts in was due primarily to a reduction in delinquent tenants accounts as marginal tenants leases were terminated or sublet and the effects of an improving economy

liquidity and capital resources general our primary sources of capital are our real estate operations and our unsecured credit facility 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and million available for borrowing under our unsecured credit facility 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from tenants under leases at our properties 
our operating cash flow therefore depends materially on the rents that we are able to charge to our tenants  and the ability of these tenants to make their rental payments 
our primary uses of cash are to fund distributions to securityholders  to fund capital investment in our existing portfolio of operating assets  and to fund new acquisitions and our development activities 
as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income to our stockholders on an annual basis 
we also regularly require capital to invest in our existing portfolio of operating assets in connection with large scale renovations  routine capital improvements  deferred maintenance on properties we have recently acquired  and our leasing activities  including funding tenant improvements  allowances and leasing commissions 
the amounts of the leasing related expenditures can vary significantly depending on negotiations with tenants and the willingness of tenants to pay higher base rents over the life of the leases 
during  we expect that we will have significant capital requirements  including the following items 
there can be no assurance that our capital requirements will not be materially higher or lower than these expectations 
funding dividends on our common and preferred stock and making distributions to third party unit holders in certain of our subsidiaries  approximately million to invest in our existing portfolio of operating assets  including approximately million to fund tenant related capital requirements  million to retire our senior unsecured notes maturing march  which we expect to pay at or before the scheduled maturity date from amounts drawn on our line of credit or from the proceeds of property dispositions and other borrowings  and approximately million to fund mezzanine loans we have committed to make in connection with two projects for which we are providing development management services 
we expect to meet our capital requirements using cash generated by our real estate operations  by borrowings on our unsecured credit facility  and from proceeds from the sale of properties 
we could also raise additional debt or equity capital in the public market or fund acquisitions of properties through property specific mortgage debt 

table of contents we believe that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations and the disposition of assets and have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop our business  to fund our operating and administrative expenses  to continue to meet our debt service obligations  to pay dividends in accordance with reit requirements  to acquire additional properties and land  and to pay for construction in progress 
if we cannot raise the expected funds from the sale of properties and or if we are unable to obtain capital from other sources  we may not be able to pay the dividend required under the terms of our preferred stock or to maintain our status as a reit  make required principal and interest payments  make strategic acquisitions or make necessary routine capital improvements with respect to our existing portfolio of operating assets 
also if  as a result of general economic downturns  our credit rating is downgraded  rental rates on new leases are significantly lower than expiring leases or our properties do not otherwise perform as expected  we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise have access to capital on favorable terms  or at all 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition  results of operations and the trading prices of our securities 
in addition  if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments  the holder of the mortgage could foreclose on the property  resulting in loss of income and asset value 
an unsecured lender could also attempt to foreclose on some of our assets in order to receive payment 
in most cases  very little of the principal amount that we borrow is repaid prior to the maturity of the loan 
we may refinance that debt when it matures  or we may pay off the loan 
if principal amounts due at maturity cannot be refinanced  extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions  such as new equity capital  our cash flow may be insufficient to repay all maturing debt 
prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of a refinancing such as possible reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans may result in higher interest rates and increased interest expense 
capital structure we manage our capital structure to reflect a flexible long term investment approach  generally seeking to match the stable return nature of our assets with a mix of equity and various debt instruments 
we expect that our capital structure will allow us to obtain additional capital from diverse sources that could include additional equity offerings of common stock and or preferred stock  public and private debt financings and possible asset dispositions 
our ability to raise funds through sales of debt and equity securities is dependent on  among other things  general economic conditions  general market conditions for reits  rental rates  occupancy levels  market perceptions about us  our debt rating and the current trading price of our stock 
we will continue to analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time  but the capital markets may not consistently be available on terms that are attractive 
in december  our board of directors approved a plan to restructure the manner in which we hold our assets by converting to what is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership reit  or upreit  structure 
to effect the upreit restructuring  we formed carramerica realty operating partnership  lp  or the operating partnership  to which we contributed substantially all of our assets on june  in exchange for of the units of common and preferred partnership interest in the operating partnership and the assumption by the operating partnership of substantially all of our liabilities  including the assumption of the obligations under our unsecured credit facility and our senior unsecured notes 
at december   we owned all of the outstanding units of partnership interest of the operating partnership 
since the upreit restructuring  substantially all of our business is being conducted through the operating partnership and our primary asset is our interest in the operating partnership 
we undertook the upreit restructuring to enable us to better compete with other office reits  many of which are structured as upreits  for the acquisition of properties from tax motivated sellers 
as a result of the upreit restructuring  the operating partnership can issue units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership to tax motivated sellers who contribute properties to the operating partnership  thereby enabling those sellers to realize certain tax benefits that would be unavailable if we purchased properties directly for cash 
the operating partnership is capitalized through the issuance of units 
we serve as the sole general partner of the operating partnership and currently own the general partnership interest and substantially all of the common limited partnership interest 
our wholly owned subsidiary  carramerica op  llc  a delaware limited liability company  owns a nominal common limited partnership interest in the operating partnership 
together  we and carramerica op  llc own a number of common units in the operating partnership equal to the number of shares of our common stock outstanding 
in connection with the upreit conversion  the operating partnership issued to us  series e cumulative redeemable preferred partnership units with terms that are substantially the same as the economic terms of our series e preferred stock 

table of contents the operating partnership is managed by us as the sole general partner of the operating partnership 
even if we in the future admit additional limited partners  as the sole general partner of the operating partnership  we will generally have the exclusive power under the partnership agreement to manage and conduct the business of the operating partnership  subject to certain limited approval and voting rights of the limited partners  in most cases including us 
real estate operations as a result of the weak economic climate over the last several years  the office real estate markets were materially affected 
the contraction of office workforces reduced demand for office space and overall vacancy rates for office properties increased in all of our markets through and our operations were adversely impacted 
in  vacancy rates appeared to peak in many of our markets and some positive net absorption of space started to occur 
in  the positive trend of reduced vacancy rates and positive net absorption continued in most of our markets 
as a result of improved job growth  leasing activity is up significantly  and we believe that market rental rates have stabilized in all of our markets and are beginning to improve in some of our markets including washington  d 
c and southern california 
rental economics are expected to improve in most of our markets by the end of due to the improving market conditions described above and the elimination of most of our poor credit quality tenants through lease defaults and terminations in the last few years  we believe that our average occupancy in most markets stabilized in the second half of our occupancy in the portfolio of operating properties increased to at december  compared to at december  and at december  if demand continues to improve in  we expect that our overall portfolio average occupancy may improve further 
our occupancy improved slightly in over due to acquisitions of properties with higher occupancies and dispositions of certain low occupancy properties 
our same store properties we owned in both years occupancy was in compared to in  although same store occupancy began to improve in the second half of increasing from at june  to at december  in connection with terminating tenants in  we earned million of termination fees 
these fees are non recurring in nature and while we expect we will earn modest termination fees in  we expect that they will be substantially lower than in rental rates on space that was re leased in decreased an average of in comparison to rates that were in effect under expiring leases 
while market rental rates have stabilized in our markets  rental rates on in place leases in certain markets remain significantly above current market rental rates 
we estimate that market rental rates on leased space expiring in will be  on average  approximately lower than straight lined rents on expiring leases 
we have million square feet of space on which leases are currently scheduled to expire in debt financing we generally use unsecured  corporate level debt  including senior unsecured notes and our unsecured credit facility  to meet our borrowing needs 
as a component of this financing strategy  we continue to unencumber our assets where possible by repaying existing mortgage debt with unsecured debt 
as of december   we had reduced our fixed rate mortgage debt to approximately million  or of our total debt  from million  or of our total debt  as of december  we generally use fixed rate debt instruments in order to match the returns from our real estate assets 
we also utilize variable rate debt for short term financing purposes or to protect against the risk  at certain times  that fixed rates may overstate our long term costs of borrowing if assumed inflation or growth in the economy implicit in higher fixed interest rates do not materialize 
at times  our mix of variable and fixed rate debt may not suit our needs 
at those times  we use derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps and caps  forward interest rate options or interest rate options in order to assist us in managing our debt mix 
we will either hedge our variable rate debt to give it a fixed interest rate or hedge fixed rate debt to give it a variable interest rate 
as a result of rising interest rates during  we increased our percentage of fixed rate debt to from in we have three investment grade ratings 
as of december   fitch rating services and standard poors have each assigned their bbb rating to our prospective senior unsecured debt offerings and their bbb rating 
table of contents to our prospective cumulative preferred stock offerings 
moody s investor service has assigned its baa rating with a stable outlook to our prospective senior unsecured debt offerings and its baa rating to our prospective cumulative preferred stock offerings 
a downgrade in rating by any one of these rating agencies could result from  among other things  a change in our financial position or a downturn in general economic conditions 
any such downgrade could adversely affect our ability to obtain future financing or could increase the interest rates on our existing variable rate debt 
however  we have no debt instruments under which the principal maturity would be accelerated upon a downward change in our debt rating 
our total debt at december  is summarized as follows in thousands fixed rate mortgages secured notes payable unsecured credit facility senior unsecured notes unamortized discount and fair value adjustment  net our fixed rate mortgage debt bore an effective weighted average interest rate of at december  and had a weighted average maturity of years 
we repaid million of fixed rate debt in  of which million was early extinguished 
in connection with these extinguishments  we incurred prepayment penalties of million which are included in interest expense 
we also converted million of mortgage debt to notes payable secured by letters of credit 
million of our total debt at december  bore a libor based variable interest rate and million of our debt was subject to variable interest rates through interest rate swap agreements 
the interest rate on borrowings on our unsecured credit facility at december  was 
our primary external source of liquidity is our credit facility 
on june   we entered into a new million  three year unsecured revolving credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank as administrative agent for a syndicate of banks 
the facility replaced and was used to repay all amounts outstanding under our previous unsecured senior credit facility 
we may increase the facility to million by our request at any time within months of the closing  provided the funding commitments are increased accordingly 
the facility can be extended one year at our option 
the facility carries an interest rate of basis points over day libor  or as of december  as of december   million was drawn on the credit facility  million in letters of credit were outstanding  and we had million available for borrowing 
our unsecured credit facility contains financial and other covenants with which we must comply 
some of these covenants include a minimum ratio of annual ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to interest expense of at least to  a minimum ratio of annual ebitda to fixed charges of at least to  a maximum ratio of aggregate unsecured debt to tangible fair market value of our unencumbered assets of  a maximum ratio of total secured debt to tangible fair market value of a maximum ratio of total debt to tangible fair market value of our assets of  and restrictions on our ability to make dividend distributions in excess of of funds from operations or the minimum amount necessary to enable us to maintain our status as a reit 
as of december   we are in compliance with all debt covenants  however  our ability to draw on our unsecured credit facility or incur other unsecured debt in the future could be restricted by the covenants 
our maximum ratio of total debt to tangible fair market value of our assets cannot exceed 
as of december   our total debt to tangible fair market value was and could restrict our ability to draw the full amount available to us under our credit facility or to incur significant other debt 
we anticipate reducing our total debt ratio by paying down our outstanding unsecured debt obligations using the proceeds from property dispositions expected 
table of contents to close in in addition  we expect to receive from our credit facility lenders a modification of the total debt covenant increasing the maximum ratio of total debt to tangible fair market value of our assets to 
there can be no assurance  however  that planned property dispositions will close or that our credit facility lenders will consent to modifications to the total debt covenant 
if our total debt ratio increases further and we do not obtain the modification of the ratio to  it could impact our business and operations  including limiting our ability to incur additional unsecured debt  including drawing on our unsecured line of credit which is our primary source of liquidity  or to invest in properties

since the start of this program in mid through december   we have acquired approximately million of our common shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
we continue to monitor market conditions and other alternative investments in order to evaluate whether repurchase of our securities is appropriate 

table of contents we pay dividends quarterly 
the maintenance of these dividends is subject to various factors  including the discretion of the board of directors  the ability to pay dividends under maryland law  the availability of cash to make the necessary dividend payments and the effect of reit distribution requirements  which require at least of our taxable income to be distributed to stockholders 
the table below details our dividend and distribution payments for and in thousands preferred stock dividends unit distributions common stock dividends cash flows from operations are an important factor in our ability to sustain our common stock dividend at its current rate 
cash flows from operations increased slightly from million in to million in we expect our cash flows from operations to be lower in than and tenant improvements are expected to remain at elevated levels as a result of factors mentioned in the introduction to our management s discussion and analysis  including but not limited to  lower expected lease termination fees  continued declines in rental rates compared to the rates on expiring leases and costs associated with a new lease in washington  dc for approximately  rentable square feet 
this lease requires the space to be taken out of service for a period of two to four months for remodeling for the new tenant  includes eight months of abated rent and requires significant capital investment in tenant improvements and lease commissions 
we expect that these factors will negatively impact our cash flows from operations and our ability to cover our current common stock dividend payment level using cash flows from operations 
we currently expect to maintain our common stock dividend rate of per quarter in as a result  we may need to borrow under our line of credit or sell assets in order to maintain our common stock dividend at the current rate 
there can be no assurance that circumstances may not change and as a result of poorer than expected operating results or the inability to obtain financing on favorable terms  or at all  that we will not later reduce our common stock dividend below the current rate 
we generally are restricted from paying dividends that would exceed of our funds from operations during any four quarter period 
capital commitments we will require capital for development projects currently underway and in the future 
as of december   we had under construction approximately  rentable square feet in an office building in a joint venture project in which we own a minority interest

through december   approximately million or of total project costs had been expended on this project 
we have financed our investment in the joint venture project under construction at december  primarily from borrowings under our credit facility

 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities vies in which the equity investors lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest or where the equity investment at risk is not sufficient for the entity to finance its activities without subordinated financial support from other parties 
the adoption of interpretation no

the adoption of the revised interpretation no 
in also had no effect on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
in particular  it requires that mandatorily redeemable financial instruments be classified as liabilities and reported at fair value and that changes in their fair values be reported as interest cost 
sfas no 
was effective for us as of july  and adoption did not affect our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based compensation 
it replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
it is required to be applied by us beginning july  we intend to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application method which requires  among other things  that we recognize compensation cost for all awards outstanding at july   for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered 
because we have used a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation costs for all employee stock compensation awards granted  modified or settled since january   and do not expect to have significant unvested awards from periods prior to january  outstanding at july   adoption of sfas no 
r is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchange of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
the amendments made by sfas no 
are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured on the fair value of assets exchanged 
the statement eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
the statement is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  funds from operations funds from operations ffo is a widely used measure of operating performance for real estate companies 
we provide ffo as a supplement to net income calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
although ffo is a widely used measure of operating performance for equity reits  ffo does not represent net income calculated in accordance with gaap 
as such  it should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance 
in addition  ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities  determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as follows net income computed in accordance with gaap  less gains or plus losses from sales of operating properties and items that are classified as extraordinary items under gaap  
table of contents plus depreciation and amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real estate industry  plus or minus adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as a measure of our performance because it excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance  such as gains on sales of real estate and real estate related depreciation and amortization  which can make periodic comparison of operating performance more difficult 
our management believes  however  that ffo  by excluding such items  which can vary among owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  can help compare the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 
our ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits 
these other reits may not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or may interpret the current nareit definition differently than us 
the following table provides the calculation of our ffo and a reconciliation of ffo to net income for the periods presented in thousands net income adjustments minority interest ffo allocable to unitholders depreciation and amortization minority interests non unitholders share of depreciation  amortization and net income gain on sale of assets ffo as defined by nareit ffo as defined by nareit for the years ended december   and  includes impairment losses on real estate of million  million and million  respectively

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future earnings and cash flows and the fair values of our financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market rates

we manage our risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities with projected cash outflows to fund debt payments  acquisitions  capital expenditures  distributions and other cash requirements 
we may also use derivative financial instruments at times to limit market risk 
derivative financial instruments may be used to convert variable rate debt to a fixed rate basis  to convert fixed rate debt to a variable rate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions

this assumes the amount outstanding under our credit facility remains at million  our balance at december  the book value of our credit facility approximates market value at december if the market rates of interest on our interest rate swap agreements change by or approximately basis points  our annual interest expense would change by approximately million 
a change in interest rates generally does not impact future earnings and cash flows for fixed rate debt instruments  except for those senior notes which have been hedged with interest rate swaps 
as fixed rate debt matures  and additional debt is incurred to fund the repayments of maturing loans  future earnings and cash flows may be impacted by changes in interest rates 
this impact would be realized in the periods subsequent to debt maturities 
the following is a summary of the fixed rate mortgages and senior unsecured debt maturities at december  in thousands thereafter  if we assume the repayments of fixed rate borrowings are made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the respective credit arrangements  a percent change in the market interest rate for the respective fixed rate debt instruments would change the fair market value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million 
the estimated fair market value of the fixed rate debt instruments and the senior unsecured notes at december  was million and  million  respectively
