item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations outlook and overview the financial results for reflect the improvement in market conditions that we reported in the first quarter of these market conditions are to a great extent due to the continuation of strong demand combined with uncertainty over disruptions in supply of oil and gas  which have fostered record high oil and gas prices over the past year 
we have experienced substantial increases in utilization and dayrates in most of our drilling segments during and anticipate that these market conditions will continue during we expect our rental tools business to continue to benefit from these market conditions during although we anticipated in our annual report that we would be reporting positive earnings by the fourth quarter of  the improvements in utilization and dayrates have been more than offset by non routine matters that have delayed our return to profitability 
we are not currently aware of any additional matters of this nature that would adversely affect our operating and financial results in a material way for the foreseeable future and we expect to be profitable in our positive outlook on operations is due in certain respects to the continuation of projects that either commenced or were committed to during the latter part of our eight rig operation in mexico reached percent operating status late in the third quarter of and should continue at this level for the next two years  with options for extensions beyond that period 
we also began receiving dayrates under our new contract for barge rig in the caspian sea during the last few days of this contract is a two well contract with options for an additional four wells 
in turkmenistan we are negotiating to move a third rig into the country  which had previously operated in russia 
in addition  we have entered into a contract to provide operations and maintenance support to a second offshore rig in sakhalin island  russia 
these last two operations are significant contributions to our existing operations in the commonwealth of independent states cis which are anchored by our drilling operations in kazakhstan and have the potential for additional growth in the near future 
in nigeria  two barge rigs have returned to work under long term contracts 
barge rig began a three year contract in september and barge rig began a two year contract with a one year option in late december our domestic utilization rate as of march  was percent 
our upgraded barge rig began operating in october at a significantly higher dayrate due to its ultra deep drilling capacity  for which we anticipate continued demand due to the high level of natural gas prices 
we have moved barge rig from nigeria to the us gulf of mexico to take advantage of the strong demand for deep barge drilling in this segment of our operations 
we expect barge rig to begin work in the us gulf of mexico early in the second quarter of based on the current trend  we anticipate dayrates and utilization to show modest improvement throughout our rental tools segment  quail tools  continues to expand its market share in the us the fourth quarter margin for quail tools was one of its best in history 
quail tools also established an international presence in by providing rental tools to operations in mexico and sakhalin island  russia 
we anticipate quail tools financial results will remain strong throughout we have also made substantial progress toward our goal of million in debt reduction  primarily through the sale of assets 
as previously reported  we sold our jackup and platform rigs in august  which  together with insurance proceeds of million from the damage to barge rig and jackup rig  allowed us to further reduce our debt by million  through february  this results in achieving percent of the debt reduction goal we established at the end of we also restructured million in debt by issuing new senior floating rate notes due in addition  although the interest rate on the majority of the debt paid off during was  the restructuring allowed us to 
table of contents results of operations continued outlook and overview continued reduce the average stated interest rate on our remaining debt from to 
we are continuing our efforts to sell additional assets to reach our debt reduction goal and to reduce our overall interest cost 
as we have reported during our recent conference calls  profitable growth and completion of our debt reduction goal are primary objectives for even though we anticipate higher levels of activity in  we will continue to conserve cash by closely monitoring our capital expenditures  working capital  inventory and general and administrative expenses 
we are positioned to show improved results for and we expect earnings to be in line with previously announced guidance of net income per share in the to range 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we recorded a net loss of million for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the loss from continuing operations was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the income loss from discontinued operations was million and million for and  respectively 
an impairment of million is included in discontinued operations related primarily to the sale of us jackup and platform rigs that were completed in  except for jackup rig which was sold in january revenues increased million to million in as compared to the increase is attributed to higher utilization in the us barge operations  international land operations and our rental tools operations  quail tools

however  we monitor our business segments based on several criteria  including drilling and rental gross margin 
management believes that this information is useful to our investors because it more closely tracks cash generated by segment 
such gross margin amounts are reconciled to our most comparable gaap measure as follows international us drilling drilling rental tools dollars in thousands year ended december  drilling and rental operating income depreciation and amortization drilling and rental gross margin year ended december  drilling and rental operating income loss depreciation and amortization drilling and rental gross margin drilling and rental operating income drilling and rental revenues less direct drilling and rental operating expenses  including depreciation and amortization expense 
us drilling segment us drilling revenues increased million in to million due to higher utilization and dayrates 
as of december  the us drilling segment consisted of barge rigs  nine deep drilling barge rigs  four intermediate drilling barge rigs and six workover barge rigs 
during the fourth quarter of  two workover barge rigs were impaired and removed from the marketable rig fleet 
in addition  during the second quarter of  deep drilling barge rig was moved to mexico to begin work on a two year contract for pemex 
average utilization for the barge rigs increased to percent from an average utilization during of percent 
the increase in utilization accounted for approximately million of the increase in revenues 
average dayrates increased approximately  per day as compared to accounting for the remaining million of the revenue increase 
during the third quarter of we upgraded barge rig enabling it to drill effectively in ultra deep shelf drilling 
the rig began drilling under a multi well program in late october at a significantly higher dayrate of approximately  per day  compared to the previous dayrate of approximately  per day 
in addition  we have relocated barge rig from nigeria to the us gulf of mexico to take advantage of the increased utilization and dayrates 
the rig will undergo maintenance and refurbishment and will be available for contract in april as a result of higher dayrates and utilization  gross margins in the us drilling segment increased million to million 
gross margins during the fourth quarter of were negatively impacted by million for the move of barge rig from nigeria to the us gulf of mexico 
international drilling segment international drilling revenues increased million to million in as compared to international land drilling revenues increased million to million offset by a reduction in international offshore drilling revenues of million to million 
international drilling gross margins decreased by million to million due almost entirely to reduced activity in the international offshore barge rigs 
international land operations experienced increased utilization in all regions except the latin america countries of colombia  bolivia and peru 
during the second and third quarters of we moved seven land rigs which had been located in colombia  bolivia and argentina to mexico to begin a two year 
table of contents results of operations continued international drilling segment continued drilling contract for halliburton de mexico halliburton contributing million in revenues 
in our asia pacific region  we increased revenues by million as a result of new drilling contracts in bangladesh  new zealand and papua new guinea when compared to in our cis region we increased revenues by million by adding a second rig in turkmenistan in march and from the full year impact of our five year labor agreement on sakhalin island 
the sakhalin island contract commenced operations in june rig which had been operating in northern russia completed its drilling activities in june and was stacked for the remainder of the year 
we are currently negotiating a contract to operate this rig in turkmenistan which would commence in the third quarter of utilization in colombia  bolivia and peru decreased significantly during most of  resulting in million less revenues when compared to in peru  operations under the contract utilizing rig were suspended  at the request of the customer  effective april  since april we have been receiving a reduced standby rate 
we expect this rig to return to a full operating dayrate during the third quarter of in bolivia no rigs worked during because we do not anticipate any change in this market for the foreseeable future  we decided to close the operation and recognized a million impairment charge during the fourth quarter of  reducing the net carrying value of the bolivia assets to net realizable value 
three land rigs remain in colombia and  as of the end of and into the first quarter of  all three are operating 
international land gross margins increased million in when compared to the increase is primarily the result of increased activity as noted above in the cis and asia pacific regions 
in addition  gross margins increased in the last half of as our seven land rigs began operations in mexico  even with increased costs related to the amortization of a loss on mobilization and startup costs 
the quarterly amortization approximates million and will be fully amortized by the end of the first quarter in when compared to  international land gross margins were negatively impacted by a million decrease in latin america operations  excluding mexico 
the decrease is primarily attributed to the standby situation in peru and the reduced activity in colombia 
international offshore drilling revenues decreased million to million in as compared to the decrease in revenues was attributable to a million decrease in the caspian sea operation and a million decrease in our nigerian operations  partially offset by increased revenues of million from our barge rig in mexico 
in november  our arctic class barge rig completed its initial four year contract and was demobilized and stacked throughout most of during the fourth quarter of  we signed a two well contract with options for an additional four wells 
barge rig began recognizing revenues under this new contract in late december in nigeria  revenues decreased significantly due to reduced utilization 
barge rig worked throughout but returned to port for repairs in june and its initial five year contract expired mid september a three year contract extension was signed in september at a dayrate approximately percent less than the initial five year term 
barge rig operated the first five months of and was stacked until mid december in mid december  barge rig began mobilizing under a new two year contract with a one year option 
barge rig remains evacuated since sustaining substantial damage due to community unrest in march in december  we received insurance proceeds in the amount of million  a portion of which was used in february to reduce long term debt 
during the fourth quarter of  we made the decision to move barge rig from nigeria to the us gulf of mexico region 
international offshore gross margins decreased million in as compared to costs to maintain barge rig in a stacked condition approximated million per quarter and we also settled an assessment of duties  taxes and penalties for barge rig with the customs control in mangistau  kazakhstan  in the third quarter of for million  resulting in a negative gross margin of million 
in nigeria  lower utilization on the barge rigs caused reduced revenues in ongoing costs to maintain the barges in stacked condition and increased insurance cost caused by losses incurred  both negatively impacted gross margin 
in addition  nigerian tax authorities assessed additional value 
table of contents results of operations continued international drilling segment continued added tax vat  resulting in a charge of million in the second quarter of all of these factors combined to reduce the million gross margin in nigeria to breakeven in barge rig commenced operations in mexico in may under a new two year contract for pemex 
prior to receiving this contract  the barge rig had operated in the us gulf of mexico 
rental tools segment rental tools revenues increased million to million in the increases in revenues were attributable to a million increase from the new iberia  louisiana facility  million from the victoria  texas facility  million from the odessa  texas facility  and million from the evanston  wyoming facility 
both the new iberia  louisiana and victoria  texas operations experienced an increase in customer demand due to increased deep water drilling in the gulf of mexico 
all locations experienced increased customer demand and saw an expansion in customer base 
other financial data depreciation and amortization expense decreased million to million in the decrease is primarily attributable to the continued commitment to our capital expenditure program that calls for limiting expenditures to scheduled ongoing maintenance projects  expenditures required under our preventive maintenance program and for capital projects with an attractive rate of return 
general and administrative expense increased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to during the first quarter of we incurred an expense of million related to the accelerated vesting of certain restricted stock including our portion of the fica expense 
the restricted shares were granted in july and were scheduled to vest over seven years  but included an accelerated vesting feature based on stock performance goals 
in accordance with the accelerated vesting feature   shares of the grant vested in march based on meeting the initial stock performance goal of per share for consecutive days 
subsequent to december   the remaining  shares vested in march after the closing stock price of was met for consecutive days which will result in an expense of million 
this expense will be recognized during the first quarter of in the second quarter of  we expensed million related to severance costs associated with our former chief operating officer 
in addition  during  we incurred approximately million related to the documentation and testing for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of sox 
during  we recognized a provision for reduction in carrying value of certain assets of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that two workover barge rigs in the us gulf of mexico fleet were not economically marketable 
as a result  we recorded an impairment of million and will dispose of the two barge rigs 
in the asia pacific region  we reduced the carrying amount of two rigs to net realizable value  which resulted in recording an impairment charge of million 
also  during the fourth quarter of  we made the decision to dispose of all the assets in bolivia  which included two land rigs  inventory and spare parts 
we incurred an impairment charge of million to reduce the cost basis of these assets to net realizable value 
we expect to close the bolivia office the second quarter of during the second quarter of  we reclassified our latin america assets from discontinued operations to continuing operations and recognized a million charge to adjust the value of the latin america assets to their fair value 
gaap requires that an operation reclassified from discontinued operations to continuing operations be measured at the lower of its a carrying amount before the asset was classified as held for sale  adjusted for any depreciation expense that would have been recognized had the asset been continuously classified as held and used  or b fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell 
the million represents the depreciation that would have been recognized had the assets been continuously classified as held and used 
in addition  during we

parker 
the value of the asset was reduced to the cash surrender value of the insurance policies 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in  three non marketable rigs in the asia pacific region and certain spare parts and equipment in new iberia  louisiana were impaired by million to estimated salvage value 
subsequent to december   we signed an agreement to sell the new iberia  louisiana land and buildings for a net sales price of million 
this resulted in an impairment of million at december   as the net book value of the property exceeded the net sales price 
the transaction closed in august and no additional gain or loss was recognized upon disposition 
interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to the net reduction of million to our outstanding debt balance in the majority of the debt reduction occurred in august with proceeds from the sale of our jackup and platform rigs 
in august and september of  we entered into three variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements 
the swap agreements did not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly  we are reporting the mark to market change in the fair value of the interest rate derivatives currently in earnings 
for the year ended december   we recognized a non cash charge for a decrease in the fair value of the derivative positions of million 
this amount is included in other income expense in the selected financial data 
on september   we issued million of senior floating rate notes and concurrently repurchased million of our senior notes at a premium and paid off million of our delay draw term loan 
total charges of million consisting of the percent premium on the repurchase of the senior notes  the write off of the previously capitalized debt issuance costs associated with the repurchase of the senior notes and the repayment of the delay draw term loan  and legal and other fees were recorded as loss on extinguishment of debt in the statement of operations 
in  in conjunction with the refinancing of a portion of our debt  we incurred million expense related to the retirement of our senior notes 
these costs have been recorded as loss on extinguishment of debt and include costs of the call premium on the senior notes  write off of remaining capitalized debt issuance costs offset by the write off of the remaining swap gain that was being amortized over the remaining life of the senior notes 
these amounts are included in other income expenses in the selected financial data 
we have a percent interest in a joint venture in kazakhstan  aralparker  which owns and operates two drilling rigs and other drilling equipment 
aralparker is included in the consolidated financial statements of parker drilling company 
during  aralparker generated net income of million and accordingly  we have recognized an expense for minority interest of million 
during  aralparker generated a loss of million resulting in income from minority interest of million 
income tax expense from continuing operations consists of foreign tax expense of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   income tax expense from continuing operations consisted of foreign tax expense of million 
foreign taxes decreased million in due primarily to reduced activity in nigeria in addition to barge rig in kazakhstan being stacked the majority of the year 
partially offsetting these reductions were increased taxes in papua new guinea related to current and prior year assessments and the startup of operations in mexico 
although we incurred a net loss in the current year  no additional deferred tax benefit was recognized since the sum of our deferred tax assets  principally the net operating loss carryforwards  exceeded the deferred tax liabilities  principally the excess of tax depreciation over book depreciation

the proceeds of the senior notes  plus an initial draw of million under the delay draw term loan facility  were used to retire million of the senior notes due that had been tendered pursuant to a tender offer dated september  the balance of the proceeds from the senior notes and the initial draw down under the term loan facility were used to retire the remaining million of senior notes that were not tendered 
we redeemed the remaining bonds on november  at a call premium of percent 
the new revolving credit facility is available for working capital requirements  general corporate purposes and to support letters of credit 
availability under the revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base limitation based on percent of eligible receivables plus a value for eligible rental tools equipment 
the credit facility calls for a borrowing base calculation only when the credit facility has commitments of at least million 
as of december   the total commitments of the credit facility were million  of which million related to letters of credit and million related to the mark to market value of the variable to fixed  interest rate swap agreements relating to our senior floating rate notes  thus a borrowing base calculation was not required 
we had total debt of million at december  the debt included million aggregate principal amount of senior notes  which are due november   million aggregate principal amount of senior floating rate notes bearing interest at a rate of the three month libor plus  which are due september   and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes  which are due october  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources continued financing activity continued as of december   we had approximately million of liquidity 
this liquidity was comprised of million of cash on hand and an estimated million of undrawn availability under the new revolving credit facility 
on february   we purchased an additional million face value of our senior notes pursuant to a redemption notice dated january  at the redemption price of percent 
the following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations as of december  less than more than total year years years years dollars in thousands contractual cash obligations long term debt principal long term debt interest operating and capital leases total contractual obligations commercial commitments revolving credit facility standby letters of credit total commercial commitments long term debt includes the principal and interest cash obligations of the senior notes  the senior notes and the senior floating rate notes 
the unamortized premium of million at december  related to the senior notes is not included in the contractual cash obligations schedule 
some of the interest on the senior floating rate notes has been fixed through variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements 
the issuer bank of america  na of each swap has the option to extend each swap for an additional two years at the termination of the initial swap period 
for this table  the highest interest rate currently hedged is used in calculating the interest on future floating rate periods 
operating leases consist of lease agreements in excess of one year for office space  equipment  vehicles and personal property 
we have a million revolving credit facility 
as of december  we had availability of million  of which none has been drawn down  but million of availability has been used to support letters of credit that have been issued and million of availability has been reserved for the mark to market value of variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements relating to our senior floating rate notes  resulting in an estimated million availability 
the revolving credit facility expires in december we have entered into employment agreements with the executive officers of the company  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we do not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities  off balance sheet financing arrangements or guarantees of third party financial obligations 
we have no energy or commodity contracts 
other matters business risks internationally  we specialize in drilling geologically challenging wells in locations that are difficult to access and or involve harsh environmental conditions 
our international services are primarily utilized by major and national oil companies and integrated service providers in the exploration and development of reserves of oil 
in the united states  we primarily drill in the transition zones of the us gulf of mexico for major and independent oil and gas companies 
business activity is primarily dependent on the exploration and development activities of the companies that make up our customer base 
generally  temporary fluctuations in oil and gas prices do not materially affect these companies exploration and 
table of contents other matters continued business risks continued development activities and consequently do not materially affect our operations  except for the us gulf of mexico  where drilling contracts are generally for a shorter term  and oil and gas companies tend to respond more quickly to upward or downward changes in prices 
many international contracts are of longer duration and oil and gas companies have committed to longer term projects to develop reserves and thus our international operations are not as susceptible to shorter term fluctuations in prices 
however  sustained increases or decreases in oil and natural gas prices could have an impact on customers long term exploration and development activities  which in turn could materially affect our operations 
generally  a sustained change in the price of oil would have a greater impact on our international operations while a sustained change in the price of natural gas would have a greater effect on us operations 
due to the locations in which we drill  our operations are subject to interruption  prolonged suspension and possible expropriation due to political instability and local community unrest 
further  we are exposed to potential liability issues from pollution and to loss of revenues in the event of a blowout 
the majority of the political and environmental risks are transferred to the operator by contract or otherwise insured 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  materials and supplies obsolescence  property and equipment  goodwill  income taxes  workers compensation and health insurance and contingent liabilities for which settlement is deemed to be probable 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while we believe that such estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies as they are complex and require significant judgments  assumptions and or estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
other significant accounting policies are summarized in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of property  plant and equipment 
we periodically evaluate our property  plant and equipment to determine that the net carrying value is not in excess of the net realizable value 
we review our property  plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may be impaired 
for example  evaluations are performed when we experience sustained significant declines in utilization and dayrates and we do not contemplate recovery in the near future  or when we reclassify property and equipment to assets held for sale or as discontinued operations as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we consider a number of factors  including estimated undiscounted future cash flows  appraisals less estimated selling costs and current market value analysis in determining net realizable value 
assets are written down to fair value if the fair value is below net carrying value 
we recorded impairments to our long lived assets of million  million and million in   and  respectively 
we also recorded million and million of impairments to our discontinued operations assets in and  respectively 
asset impairment evaluations are  by nature  highly subjective 
they involve expectations about future cash flows generated by our assets  reflect management s assumptions and judgments regarding future 
table of contents other matters continued critical accounting policies continued industry conditions and their effect on future utilization levels  dayrates and costs 
the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets 
impairment of goodwill 
we periodically assess whether the excess of cost over net assets acquired is impaired based generally on the estimated future cash flows of that operation 
if the estimated fair value is in excess of the carrying value of the operation  no further analysis is performed 
if the fair value of each operation  to which goodwill has been assigned  is less than the carrying value  we will deduct the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and compare the residual amount to the carrying value of the goodwill to determine if impairment should be recorded 
changes in the assumptions such as dayrate and utilization used in the fair value calculation could result in an estimated reporting unit fair value that is below the carrying value  which may give rise to an impairment of goodwill 
in addition to the annual review  we also test for impairment should an event occur or circumstances change that may indicate a reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
in  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and as a result  we discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we performed an impairment review at year end and recorded an impairment of million 
our annual impairment tests of goodwill at year end and indicated that the fair value of operations to which goodwill relates exceeded the carrying values as of december  and  accordingly  no impairments were recorded 
insurance reserves 
our operations are subject to many hazards inherent to the drilling industry  including blowouts  explosions  fires  loss of well control  loss of hole  damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters 
any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death  damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities  suspension of operations  environmental damage and damage to the property of others 
generally  drilling contracts provide for the division of responsibilities between a drilling company and its customer  and we seek to obtain indemnification from our customers by contract for certain of these risks 
to the extent that we are unable to transfer such risks to customers by contract or indemnification agreements  we seek protection through insurance 
however  there is no assurance that such insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above 
moreover  our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of an insurance coverage deductible 
based on the risks discussed above  it is necessary for us to estimate the level of our liability related to insurance and record reserves for these amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
reserves related to insurance are based on the facts and circumstances specific to the insurance claims and our past experience with similar claims 
the actual outcome of insured claims could differ significantly from estimated amounts 
we maintain actuarially determined accruals in our consolidated balance sheet to cover self insurance retentions for workers compensation  employers liability  general liability and automobile liability claims 
these accruals are based on certain assumptions developed utilizing historical data to project future losses 
loss estimates in the calculation of these accruals are adjusted based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims 
these loss estimates and accruals recorded in our financial statements for claims have historically been reasonable in light of the actual amount of claims paid 
as the determination of our liability for insurance claims is subject to significant management judgment and in certain instances is based on actuarially estimated and calculated amounts  and such liabilities could be material in nature  management believes that accounting estimates related to insurance reserves are critical 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary 
table of contents other matters continued critical accounting policies continued differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences and the net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we established a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period  we include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues and expenses on dayrate contracts as the drilling progresses 
for meterage contracts  which are rare  we recognize the revenues and expenses upon completion of the well 
revenues from rental activities are recognized ratably over the rental term which is generally less than six months 
mobilization fees received and related mobilization costs incurred  if significant  are deferred and amortized over the term of the related drilling contract 
accounting for derivative instruments 
we follow sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
established accounting and disclosure requirements for most derivative instruments and hedge transactions involving derivatives 
sfas no 
also requires formal documentation procedures for hedging relationships and effectiveness testing when hedge accounting is to be applied 
in august and september  we entered into two variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements to reduce our cash flow exposure to increases in interest rates on our senior floating rate notes 
the interest rate swap agreements provide us with interest rate protection on the million senior floating rate notes due we did not elect to pursue hedge accounting for the interest rate swap agreements  which were executed to provide the economic hedge against cash flow variability on the floating rate notes 
we assessed the key characteristics of the interest rate swap agreements and the notes and determined that the hedging relationship would not be highly effective 
this ineffectiveness is caused by the existence of embedded written call options in the interest rate swap agreements and not in the notes 
accordingly  we will recognize the volatility of the swap agreements on a mark to market basis in the statement of operations 
for the year ended december   we recognized a non cash decrease in the fair value of the interest rate derivatives of million 
this non cash expense is reported in the statement of operations as changes in fair value of derivative positions 
the non cash decrease in fair value is reported in the balance sheet as other long term liabilities 
for additional information see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the fair market value adjustment of these swap agreements will generally fluctuate based on the implied forward interest rate curve for the three month libor 
if the implied forward interest rate curve decreases  the fair market value of the interest swap agreements will decrease and we will record an additional charge 
if the implied forward interest rate curve increases  the fair market value of the interest swap agreements will increase  and we will record income 
we will analyze the position of the swap agreements on a quarterly basis and record the mark to market impact based on the analysis 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
clarifies the accounting for idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material to require that all of the aforementioned items be recognized as current period costs 
arb no 
previously required that these items reach a level of abnormality before they were expensed 
sfas no 
eliminates the abnormality requirement and 
table of contents other matters continued recent accounting pronouncements continued establishes current period recognition 
sfas no 
will become effective for us beginning with the calendar year the adoption of this standard should not have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
under apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  the fundamental premise was that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
there was  however  an exception that allowed the exchange of similar productive assets to be recorded on a carryover basis of the original asset 
this standard eliminates this exception and replaces it with a general exception that allows for a carryover basis only for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange is considered to have commercial substance if the entity s future cash flows are expected to change as a result of the exchange 
sfas no 
will become effective for us for nonmonetary transactions entered into beginning with the calendar year we do not anticipate that the statement will have significant effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
also in december  the fasb revised sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation through issuance of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r eliminates the alternative under the original statement to account for situations in which an entity compensates employees with share based payments using the intrinsic value method established in apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires that all such transactions be accounted for using the fair value method 
we plan to adopt sfas no 
r on july  using the modified prospective method without restatement of prior interim periods of the current fiscal year 
the impact of adopting sfas no 
r will be to record expense for previously issued but unvested employee stock options and any employee stock options that we issue in the future 
we expect the dollar impact on our financial statements to be consistent with the impact disclosed in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company entered into two variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements as a strategy to manage the floating rate risk on the million senior floating rate notes 
the first agreement  signed on august   fixed the interest rate on million at for a three year period beginning september  and terminating september  and fixed the interest rate on an additional million at for the two year period beginning september  and terminating september  in each case  an option to extend each swap for an additional two years at the same rate was given to the issuer  bank of america  na the second agreement  signed on september   fixed the interest rate on million at for the three month period beginning december  and terminating march  options to extend million at a fixed interest rate of for the six month period beginning march  and to extend million at a fixed interest rate of for the month period beginning march  and terminating september  were given to the issuer  bank of america  na subsequent to year end  bank of america  na allowed these options to expire unexercised 
these swap agreements do not meet the hedge criteria in sfas no 
and are  therefore  not designated as hedges 
accordingly  the change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps is recognized currently in earnings 
as of december   the company had the following derivative instruments outstanding related to its interest rate swaps swap notional fixed fair agreement effective date termination date amount floating rate rate value dollars in thousands september  september   three month libor plus basis points september  september   three month libor plus basis points december  march   three month libor plus basis points
