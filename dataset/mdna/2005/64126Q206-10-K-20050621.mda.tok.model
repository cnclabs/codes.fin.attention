item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in item herein 
management is of the opinion that inflation and changing prices  including foreign exchange fluctuations  will have little  if any  effect on our consolidated financial position or results of our operations 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that involve the use of complicated processes  assumptions  estimates and or judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element  item or account in the consolidated financial statements 
accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events  or the present status of an asset or liability 
the accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made 
additionally  different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
we have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of the board of directors and have identified the following critical accounting policies for the current year 
principles of consolidation we consolidate entities when we have the ability to control the operating and financial decisions and policies of that entity 
the determination of our ability to control or exert significant influence over an entity involves the use of judgment 
we apply the equity method of accounting where we can exert significant influence over  but do not control  the policies and decisions of an entity 
see the executive overview below or note to our consolidated financial statements for our equity method investments 
we use the cost method of accounting where we are unable to exert significant influence over the entity 
equity method of accounting our investments in ic bh  rci  route casinos and sunrise are accounted for using the equity method of accounting because the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over the investees 
significant influence is generally deemed to exist where we have an ownership interest in the investee of between and  although other factors such as the degree of ultimate control  representation on the investee s board of directors or similar oversight body are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate 
we record our equity in the income or losses of our investees using the same reporting periods as presented  except we report our equity in income or losses three months in arrears for rci which has a calendar fiscal year and one month in advance for ic bh which has a fiscal year ending on the last sunday in april 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded for allocated earnings or losses of our equity investments that are not currently reportable or deductible for federal income tax purposes 
we utilize the equity method of accounting for our interest of in route casinos because the operating activities of the joint venture are currently controlled by the minority venturer 
as disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we are involved in pending legal proceedings with the minority venturer in route casinos in which the minority venturer has asserted that the operating agreement governing the venture is void and unenforceable 
we have assessed whether this circumstance indicates utilization of the cost method of accounting for this investment and have concluded that the equity method best reflects the underlying nature of our investment 
the operating agreement provides that all material decisions of the joint venture are made by the members  including us  on a unanimous basis 
we believe the operating agreement to be binding and enforceable on the venture and our joint venture partner and  therefore  conclude that we have significant influence over the affairs of the venture 
we also believe that we are able to reasonably estimate the revenues and expenses of the venture to the extent necessary to apply the equity method of accounting  as described in more detail below under the heading use of estimates 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results can  and often do  differ from those estimates 
we have estimated our share of operational activities of route casinos and have recorded such amounts using the equity method of accounting see equity method of accounting because we do not receive current revenue and expense information from the venture as a consequence of ongoing litigation see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the estimated revenues are based on published net win numbers provided by the route casino to the state of new mexico gaming control board for the  gaming devices leased to the casino by route casinos 
estimated expenses are comprised of debt service payments on the  gaming devices supplied to the casino  the supply of parts for the repair of these gaming devices  and a monthly overhead fee to the other member of the route casinos  that was initially agreed to by us and the other member 
the direct expenses related to the debt service of the gaming devices and the other member s overhead are stable costs with little variable activity 
we believe the net profits determined from the estimated revenues and expenses are reasonable  however  actual financial results may materially and adversely vary from our estimates 
capitalized development costs we capitalize certain third party legal  professional  and other miscellaneous fees directly related to the procurement  evaluation and establishment of contracts for development projects 
development costs are recorded on the cost basis and are amortized over the estimated economic term of the contract 
we review each project on a quarterly basis to assess whether any changes to our estimates are appropriate 
if accumulated costs of a specific project exceed the net realizable value of such project or the project is abandoned  the costs are charged to earnings 
we amortize capitalized development costs of dcc  over the five year term of the credit enhancement fee contract 
each quarter  we recognize as expense a percentage of our capitalized development costs determined by dividing actual credit enhancement fees received for the quarter by estimated credit enhancement fees to be received over the five year term of the contract 
we believe this method is appropriate because it matches income and expenses over the term of the contract 
we also review estimated credit enhancement fees to be received over the remaining term of the contract on a quarterly basis to assess whether any changes to our estimates are appropriate 
as of june   we have not found it necessary to change the estimated amount of credit enhancement fees over the remaining term of the contract 
asset and investment impairments we apply the provisions of statement of financials accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  to account for asset and investment impairments 
under these standards  we evaluate an asset or investment for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recovered 
these events include market declines that are believed to be other than temporary  changes in the manner in which we intend to use a long lived asset  decisions to sell an asset or investment and adverse changes in the legal or business environment such as adverse actions by regulators 
when an event occurs  we evaluate the recoverability of our carrying value based on either i the long lived asset s ability to generate future cash flows on an undiscounted basis or ii the fair value of our investment in unconsolidated affiliates 
if an impairment is indicated or if we decide to exit or sell a long lived asset or group of assets  we adjust the carrying value of these assets downward  if necessary  to their estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
our fair value estimates are generally based on market data obtained through the sales process or an analysis of expected discounted cash flows 
the magnitude of any impairments are impacted by a number of factors  including the nature of the assets to be sold and our established time frame for completing the sales  among other factors 
we also reclassify the asset or assets as either held for sale or as discontinued operations  depending on  among other criteria  whether we will have any continuing involvement in the cash flows of those assets after they are sold 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish provisions for losses on accounts and notes receivable if we determine that we will not collect all or part of the outstanding balance 
we regularly review collectibility and establish or adjust our allowance as necessary using the specific identification method 
we make advances to indian tribes and other third parties under executed promissory notes for project costs related to the development of gaming and entertainment properties 
due diligence is conducted by our management with the assistance of legal counsel prior to entering into arrangements with indian tribes and other third parties to provide financing in connection with their efforts to secure and develop the properties 
repayment terms are largely dependent upon the operating performance of each opportunity for which the funds have been loaned 
interest income is not accrued until it is reasonably assured that the project will be completed and that there will be sufficient profits from the facility to cover the interest to be earned under the respective note 
if projected cash flows are not sufficient to recover amounts due  the note is evaluated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  to determine the appropriate discount to be recorded on the note for it to be considered a performing loan 
if the note is performing  interest is recorded using the effective interest method based on the value of the discounted note balance 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we review on a quarterly basis each of our notes receivable to evaluate whether the collection of our note receivable is still probable 
in our analysis  we review the economic feasibility and the current financial  legislative and development status of the project 
if our analysis indicates that the project is still economically feasible  we will continue recording the note receivable as an asset 
if our analysis indicates that the project is no longer economically feasible  then the note receivable would be written down to its estimated fair value 
revenue recognition we record revenues from credit enhancement fees  interest on notes receivable and royalties on the accrual basis as earned 
the dates on which payments are collected may vary dependent upon the term of the contracts or note receivable agreements 
for certain notes receivable related to indian gaming projects  interest income is not accrued until it is reasonably assured that the project will be completed and that there will be sufficient profits from the gaming facility to cover the interest to be earned under the respective notes 
if the note is performing  interest is recorded using the effective interest method based on the value of the discounted note balance 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires the use of an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
under this approach  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences  using currently enacted tax laws  attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
we record current income taxes based on our current taxable income  and we provide for deferred income taxes to reflect estimated future tax payments and receipts 
we account for tax credits under the flow through method  which reduces the provision for income taxes in the year the tax credits first become available 
we reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance when  based on our estimates  it is more likely than not that a portion of those assets will not be realized in a future period 
the estimates utilized in recognition of deferred tax assets are subject to revision  either up or down  in future periods based on new facts or circumstances 
accrued litigation liability we assess our exposure to loss contingencies including legal matters and provide for an exposure if the potential loss is justified to be probable and estimable 
if the actual loss from a contingency differs from management s estimate  operating results could be impacted 
as of march   we did not record any accrued litigation liability 
executive overview we were formed in and since  have primarily been a gaming company involved in financing  developing  owning and operating commercial gaming projects and financing  developing and managing native american owned gaming projects 
our gaming facility operations are located in the united states of america us  specifically in the states of colorado  california  oklahoma and new mexico 
historically  we have relied upon our equity investment in ic bh for the majority of our earnings and cash flow 
currently  ic bh is completing a million capital expansion for ic bh s colorado properties adding approximately slot machines  hotel rooms  and a new restaurant which should increase our future earnings from ic bh 
in fiscal year  dcc began receiving a credit enhancement fee from the river rock casino 
we own of and consolidate dcc 
river rock casino completed the construction of a parking garage in december which increased their parking capacity from approximately spaces to  spaces which will accommodate up to approximately  customer vehicles when operated by a valet service company during peak demand periods 
we believe river rock casino s revenues will increase with these additional parking spaces which will in turn increase our credit enhancement fees 
accordingly  we believe that credit enhancement fees will become a larger contributor to our future revenues and earnings 
we expect to receive credit enhancement fees through may on april  we acquired the colorado grande casino from ic bh and anticipate the casino will also add to our future revenues and earnings 
our business strategy will continue to focus on gaming projects but with a greater emphasis on owning and operating gaming establishments 
if we are successful  both our future revenues and costs can be expected to increase 
our revenues were million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively

total expenses decreased  or  for fiscal year compared to fiscal year salary expenses increased  or million  and general and administrative expenses increased  or  both increases are primarily due to increased investment in corporate infrastructure to handle projected growth  including the addition of new personnel and the costs associated with those additional employees 
we also incurred increased compliance costs related to requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of interest expense in fiscal year decreased  or million  and amortization of deferred loan issue costs decreased  both attributable to our repayment of million of our debt in fiscal year we wrote off  of capitalized development costs that were incurred for a gaming project we evaluated for acquisition that was subsequently taken off the market 
we also wrote off a note receivable of  for a gaming project  based upon our decision to no longer pursue the project 
earnings from unconsolidated affiliates 
earnings from unconsolidated affiliates decreased  or million  for fiscal year compared to fiscal year earnings of ic bh decreased to million due to a decrease in revenue caused by construction disruption at its black hawk properties 
ic bh s million expansion project at its black hawk properties resulted in traffic disruption and the closing of the front entrance of the casinos 
the first phase of the expansion was completed by the end of fiscal year  thereby ending the major construction 
earnings from ic bh also decreased by million related to an impairment charge resulting from our purchase of the colorado grande casino from ic bh for a purchase price of million  which was less than the book value of the casino

interest expense increased  or  because of a higher weighted average debt balance 
our overall debt was significantly reduced in november due to our early repayment of our million credit facility 
legal and professional fees increased  or  the increase is mainly due to increased legal fees related to the route casinos dispute discussed in part i  item amortization of deferred loan issuance cost increased  to million 
the increase is primarily attributable to the recognition of  of deferred loan issuance cost related to our early repayment of our million credit facility in november  offset by  of amortization reversal during fiscal year attributable to the forfeiture of certain warrants 
we wrote off  of capitalized development costs in fiscal year due to our decision to no longer pursue development of certain gaming projects

liquidity and capital resources historical cash flows the following table sets forth our consolidated net cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities for each of the years in the three year period ended march  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year increased million compared to fiscal year mainly due to higher credit enhancement fees from river rock and an income tax refund 
during fiscal year  we received million of credit enhancement fees from river rock casino  a million income tax refund and million in tax distributions from ic bh 
all of our future tax distributions from ic bh will go towards the repayment of the million note payable to ic bh related to the purchase of the colorado grande casino until it is repaid which we anticipate will occur in fiscal year in fiscal year we also had non cash write offs of a  note receivable and  of capitalized development costs related to projects which we are no longer pursuing  because they are no longer economically feasible 
investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities during the fiscal year end march  decreased by million compared to fiscal year million of the decrease was due to the decreased balance of our notes receivable 
river rock casino had repaid million in notes payable to us in fiscal year and million in in addition to notes receivable collected from river rock we collected million in notes receivable from affiliates 
also  we made million of advances on notes receivable in connection with development projects and spent million in capitalized development costs 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities during fiscal year decreased by million from fiscal year  mainly due to our repayment of million on our debt in fiscal year compared to million in debt repayments in fiscal year during fiscal year  we repurchased  shares of our common stock in the open market  at a total purchase price of million  and we received million from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
future sources and uses of cash we expect that our future liquidity and capital requirements will be affected by capital requirements related to existing and future development projects and acquisitions  debt service requirements  and working capital requirements 
at march   outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities totaled million 
in addition  we have lease guarantees of approximately  relating to the river rock casino project and we have guaranteed debt of approximately  of an affiliated company 
to date  tax distributions from ic bh  distributions from dcc of our portion of the credit enhancement fees from river rock casino and loan repayments from affiliates have been sufficient to satisfy our current debt obligations and working capital needs 
however  on april  we executed a three year million promissory note payable to ic bh in connection with the purchase of the colorado grande casino  and we will apply our future quarterly tax distributions from ic bh to the repayment of interest and principal due on this note until it is repaid 
until this note is repaid  which we expect will occur in fiscal year  we will be relying solely on credit enhancement fees from the river rock casino and affiliate loan repayments to satisfy our current debt obligations and working capital needs 
we will need to borrow funds under the revolving credit facility if we have insufficient cash flow to satisfy our obligations and working capital needs see indebtedness below 
on march   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we currently expect funds generated from our operating activities  together with existing cash and cash equivalents  and availability of borrowings under our credit facility  will be adequate to fund our ongoing operating and debt service requirements 
indebtedness in june  we amended the financing documents relating to our existing million credit facility convertible note maturing december  the interest rate on the convertible note was amended from to per annum 
also in june  we entered into a million revolving credit facility credit facility with the same lender 
principal advances under the credit facility bear interest at per annum and the credit facility has a maturity date of june  during fiscal year  we paid down the amount of indebtedness outstanding under the convertible note to approximately million by utilizing proceeds received from draws of approximately million under the credit facility 
the reduction of the convertible note to million had the effect of reducing the shares into which the principal amount of debt is convertible from  shares to  shares 
in may  the holder of our million convertible note converted million of principal into  shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the credit facility allows us to draw up to million less outstanding indebtedness under the convertible note at any time prior to june   which is the maturity date for the credit facility 
the convertible note and credit facility are secured by our interest in ic bh 
as of march   we had approximately million in outstanding debt under the credit facility  with approximately million in availability 
at june   we had approximately million in outstanding indebtedness  with approximately million in availability under the credit facility 
we acquired the colorado grande casino through the purchase of of the stock of colorado grande enterprises  inc from ic bh on april  for the purchase price of million  was paid in cash and a promissory note was issued to ic bh for the remaining million 
simple interest will accrue on the outstanding principal on the note at a rate equal to ic bh s cost of funds plus one percent per annum 
ic bh s cost of funds is variable  with the rate dependent on the rate under ic bh s credit facility  which is currently libor plus basis points 
the note will mature on april  our future quarterly tax distributions from ic bh will be applied to the repayment of the interest and principal due on our million note until it is repaid 
the note is secured by of the stock in colorado grande enterprises  inc during fiscal year  we resolved a dispute with a financial advisor who facilitated the procurement of the convertible note by allowing his cashless exercise of a warrant for  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share 
the implied cash value of the exercise of all of the warrants was  the implied cash value was exchanged for  shares of common stock at a fair market value of per share  leaving a net issuance of  shares of common stock 
we repurchased  of these shares at per share  which was the quoted closing market price on the date of the transaction 
we paid the purchase price by issuing a million note  with interest at the rate of per annum 
principal payments of million are due on each of april  and april  the  shares of common stock repurchased were subsequently retired by us since there was no immediate plan to reissue these shares in the near term 
the repurchase of the shares of common stock was at fair market value on the measurement date  which was june   thus no expense was recorded 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we prepaid the million principal payment which was originally due on april  off balance sheet arrangements as of march   we have certain off balance sheet arrangements that may affect our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations  including a guarantee of  of indebtedness of a related party  service interactive  inc si  and a guarantee of operating lease payments for river rock casino in the amount of   at june in the event of nonperformance by si and river rock casino under the terms of the obligations  our maximum potential future payment under these guarantees will be equal to the carrying amount of the liabilities 
as of march   our maximum potential future payment under these guarantees was   as of june  
contractual obligations the following table sets forth estimates of our contractual obligations as of march  to make future payments in fiscal year through fiscal year and thereafter estimated contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt  including fixed rate interest estimated interest payments operating lease commitments other commitments total see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
estimated interest payments are based on the outstanding balance of our debt as of march   which is million 
additional borrowings have been made subsequent to march  and the outstanding balance of our debt as of june  is million 
see note to our consolidated financial statement in this annual report 
recent accounting pronouncements accounting for stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this standard requires that companies measure and record the fair value of their stock based compensation awards at fair value on the date they are granted to employees 
this fair value is determined based on a variety of assumptions  including volatility rates  forfeiture rates and the option pricing model used eg binomial or black scholes 
these assumptions could significantly differ from those we currently utilize in determining the pro forma compensation expense included in our disclosures required under sfas no 
this standard will also impact the manner in which we recognize the income tax impacts of our stock compensation programs in our financial statements 
this standard is effective for the first interim period of fiscal years beginning after june  the company s fiscal year beginning may   at which time companies can select whether they will apply the standard retroactively by restating their historical financial statements or prospectively for new stock based compensation arrangements and the unvested portion of existing arrangements 
we are currently evaluating its impact on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting changes and error corrections in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 

sfas requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas also redefines restatement as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
this statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  including interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  credit risk  commodity price and equity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is credit risk concentrations 
we do not believe we are subject to material interest risk or foreign currency risk 
our credit facilities are fixed interest rate instruments and an interest rate change would not have any impact on our operations
