our success also depends upon economic trends generally and various market conditions 
we caution you not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which reflect our analysis only and speak as of the date of this report or  if different  as of the dates indicated in the statements 
we assume no obligation to update or supplement forward looking statements 
we are a publicly traded real estate investment trust focused primarily on the ownership  operation  management  acquisition  expansion and selective redevelopment and development of high quality  strategically located properties containing office laboratory space leased principally to tenants in the life science industry 
we refer to these properties as life science properties 
in  we acquired properties with an aggregate of approximately  rentable square feet 
in addition  we completed the development of a property with an aggregate of approximately  rentable square feet 
expanded our unsecured line of credit from million to million and extended its term to december  which may be further extended at our sole option for an additional one year period 
expanded our unsecured term loan from million to million and extended its term to december sold one property with approximately  rentable square feet 
completed a public offering of  shares of our series c cumulative redeemable preferred stock series c preferred stock 
redeemed all of the outstanding shares of our series a cumulative preferred stock with proceeds from the series c preferred stock offering 
our primary source of revenue is rental income and tenant recoveries from leases at the properties we own 
of the properties we owned as of december   four were acquired in  nine in  nine in  in  six in  in  five in  four in  four in the properties and in in addition  we completed the development of one property in  five properties in together with the properties acquired in  the properties  two properties in together with the five properties acquired in  the properties  two properties in together with the four properties acquired in  the properties and one property in together with the properties acquired in  the properties 
as a result of these acquisition and development activities  as well as our ongoing leasing and redevelopment activities  there have been significant increases in total revenues and expenses  including significant increases in total revenues and expenses for as compared to  and for as compared to critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base these estimates  judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
reit compliance we have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust reit under the internal revenue code 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code to our operations and financial results  and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 
we believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code to enable us to qualify  and continue to qualify  as a reit 
however  it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a reit  or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  then we will be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
if we lose our reit status  then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders 
rental properties and properties under development in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  we perform the following procedures when making an allocation of the purchase price of real estate estimate the value of the real estate as of the acquisition date on an as if vacant basis  allocate the as if vacant value among land  land improvements  buildings  building improvements  tenant improvements and equipment  calculate the value of the intangibles as the difference between the as if vacant value and the purchase price  and allocate the intangible value to above  below and at market leases  origination costs associated with in place leases  tenant relationships and other intangible assets 
the values allocated to land improvements  buildings  building improvements  tenant improvements and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis using an estimated life of years for land improvements  years for buildings and building improvements  the respective lease term for tenant improvements and the estimated useful life for equipment 
the values of above and below market leases are amortized over the life of the related lease and recorded as either an increase for below market leases or a decrease for above market leases to rental income 
the values of at market leases and origination costs are classified as leasing costs  included in other assets on our balance sheets and amortized over the remaining life of the lease 
rental properties and properties under development are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the property 
upon determination that impairment has occurred  a write down is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the property to its estimated fair value 
capitalization of costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 capitalization of interest cost sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects sfas  we capitalize direct construction and development costs  including predevelopment costs  interest  property taxes  insurance and other costs directly related and essential to the acquisition  development or construction of a project 
pursuant to sfas and sfas  capitalization of construction and development costs is required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use 
costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred 
costs previously capitalized related to abandoned acquisition or development opportunities are written off 
should development activity cease  a portion of interest  property taxes  insurance and certain costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization  and would be expensed as incurred 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
we also capitalize costs directly related and essential to our leasing activities 
these costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases 
costs that were previously capitalized and which related to unsuccessful leasing opportunities are written off 
accounting for investments we hold equity investments in certain publicly traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science industry 
all of our investments in publicly traded companies are considered available for sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas  and are recorded at fair value 
fair value has been determined as the closing trading price at the balance sheet date  with unrealized gains and losses shown as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the classification of investments under sfas is determined at the time each investment is made  and such determination is reevaluated at each balance sheet date 
the cost of investments sold is determined by the specific identification method  with net realized gains included in other income 
investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the cost method because we do not influence any operating or financial policies of the entities in which we invest 
certain investments are accounted for under the equity method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock and emerging issues task force topic d  accounting for limited partnership investments 
under the equity method of accounting  we record our investment initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount of the investment to recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the date of our investment 
for all of our investments  if a decline in the fair value of an investment below its carrying value is determined to be other than temporary  such investment is written down to its estimated fair value with a non cash charge to current earnings 
the factors that we consider in making these assessments include  but are not limited to  market prices  market conditions  financial condition  prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results  new product initiatives and or sales  and new collaborative agreements 
interest rate swap agreements we utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates associated with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan 
these agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating interest payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount the notional amount 
interest received under all of our swap agreements is based on the one month libor rate 
the net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense 
we reflect our interest rate swap agreements on the balance sheet at their estimated fair values 
we use a variety of methods and assumptions based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date to determine the fair values of our interest rate swap agreements 
these methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value  and such value may never be realized 
all of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed highly effective under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities in reducing our exposure to variable interest rates 
accordingly  we have categorized these instruments as cash flow hedges 
while we intend to continue to meet the conditions for such hedge accounting  if hedges did not qualify as highly effective  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings 
we do not believe we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk in our interest rate swap agreements as our counterparties are established  well capitalized financial institutions 
recognition of rental income rental income from leases with scheduled rent increases  free rent and other rent adjustments is recognized on a straight line basis over the respective lease terms 
we include amounts currently recognized as income  and expected to be received in later years  in deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
amounts received currently  but recognized as income in future years  are included as unearned rent in accounts payable  accrued expenses and tenant security deposits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
tenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes  insurance  repairs and maintenance  and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable expenses are incurred 
we maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make required payments 
if a tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance  we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of unpaid rent and deferred rent 
discontinued operations we follow the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets in determining whether a property qualifies as an asset held for sale and should be classified as discontinued operations 
a property is classified as held for sale when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met management  having the authority to approve the action  commits to a plan to sell the property  the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition  subject only to the terms that are usual and customary  an active program to locate a buyer  and other actions required to complete the plan to sell  have been initiated  the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within one year  the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value  and actions necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn 
when all of these criteria have been met  the property is classified as held for sale and its operations are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income 
when a property is designated as held for sale  amounts for all prior periods presented are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations 
a loss is recognized for any initial adjustment of the asset s carrying amount to fair value less costs to sell in the period the asset qualifies as held for sale 
depreciation of assets is discontinued commencing on the date they are designated as held for sale

aggregate borrowings under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan may be limited to an amount based on the net operating income derived from a pool of unencumbered properties 
accordingly  as we acquire or complete the development or redevelopment of additional unencumbered properties  aggregate borrowings available under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan will increase up to a maximum combined amount of million 
under these provisions as of december   aggregate borrowings under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan were limited to million 
under the amended and restated unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan  we have an option to increase our maximum available commitment by an additional million 
we utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates associated with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan 
these agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating interest payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount the notional amount 
interest received under all of our swap agreements is based on the one month libor rate

in addition  we have entered into master derivative agreements with each counterparty 
these master derivative agreements all of which are on the standard international swaps derivatives association  inc form define certain terms between us and each counterparty to address and minimize certain risks associated with our swap agreements  including a default by a counterparty 
as of december  and  our interest rate swap agreements have been classified at their fair values of approximately million and million  respectively  in accounts payable  accrued expenses and tenant security deposits in our consolidated balance sheets 
the offsetting adjustments of million and million  respectively  were reflected as deferred losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the stockholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheets

other resources and liquidity requirements in june  we completed a public offering of  shares of our series c cumulative redeemable preferred stock including the shares issued upon exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
the shares were issued at a price of per share  resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriters discounts and other offering costs 
in december  we amended and restated our existing unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan 
the maximum permitted borrowings under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan increased to million and million  respectively 
we may in the future elect to increase commitments under the unsecured line of credit by up to an additional million 
we expect to continue meeting our short term liquidity and capital requirements generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities 
we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a reit 
we also believe that net cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund recurring non revenue enhancing capital expenditures  tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
we expect to meet certain long term liquidity requirements  such as for property acquisitions  property development and redevelopment activities  scheduled debt maturities  expansions and other non recurring capital improvements  through net cash provided by operating activities  long term secured and unsecured indebtedness  including borrowings under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan  and the issuance of additional debt and or equity securities 
exposure to environmental liabilities in connection with the acquisition of all of our properties  we have obtained phase i environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues 
the phase i environmental assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole  nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the phase i environmental assessments were completed 
in addition  we carry a policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to certain environmental losses at all of our properties

major capital expenditures also include one time costs related to the implementation of our national branding and signage program 
major capital expenditures for include a one time hvac system upgrade at one property totaling  per square foot in portfolio 
major capital expenditures for include  per square foot in portfolio in one time costs related to the implementation of our national branding and signage program 
recurring capital expenditures for include  per square foot in portfolio related to a fully leased property in san diego  california that underwent substantial renovation in excludes space that has undergone redevelopment before retenanting 
capital expenditures fluctuate in any given period due to the nature  extent and timing of improvements required and the extent to which they are recoverable from our tenants 
approximately of our leases provide for the recapture of certain capital expenditures such as hvac systems maintenance and or replacement  roof replacement and parking lot resurfacing 
in addition  we maintain an active preventative maintenance program at each of our properties to minimize capital expenditures required 
tenant improvements and leasing costs also fluctuate in any given year depending upon factors such as the timing and extent of vacancies  property age  location and characteristics  the type of lease renewal tenant or retenanted space  the involvement of external leasing agents and overall competitive market conditions 
inflation as of december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our leases on a square footage basis were triple net leases  requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes and insurance  common area and other operating expenses  including increases thereto 
the decrease in tripe net leases from to is primarily due to gross leases added to the portfolio from properties acquired in gross leases are generally converted to triple net leases upon renewal or rollover 
in addition  as of december   approximately of our leases on a square footage basis required the tenants to pay a majority of operating expenses 
approximately of our leases on a square footage basis contained effective annual rent escalations that are either fixed generally ranging from to or indexed based on the consumer price index or another index 
accordingly  we do not believe that our earnings or cash flow from real estate operations are subject to any significant risk from inflation 
an increase in inflation  however  could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate borrowings  including our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan 
funds from operations gaap basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes real estate values diminish over time 
in an effort to overcome the miscorrelation between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets  the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit established the measurement tool of funds from operations ffo 
since its introduction  ffo has become a widely used non gaap financial measure by reits 
we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity reit 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the board of governors of nareit in its april white paper the white paper and related implementation guidance  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other equity reits  and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
in  nareit issued guidance which modifies the calculation of ffo for both past and future periods 
in accordance with nareit s revised guidance  we now include losses from early extinguishment of debt and real estate impairment charges in our calculation of ffo 
as such  the reported amounts of ffo for the year ended december  have been modified from those previously reported 
the white paper defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
while ffo is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for reits  it should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance  or to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make distributions 
see liquidity and capital resources cash flows above for information regarding these measures of cash flow 
we believe that net income is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to ffo

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we believe we are exposed is interest rate risk  which may result from many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control 
in order to modify and manage the interest rate characteristics of our outstanding debt and to limit the effects of interest rate risks on our operations  we may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts 
the use of these types of instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks  such as counter party credit risk and the legal enforceability of hedging contracts 
our future earnings  cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are primarily dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest  such as libor 
however  our interest rate swap agreements are intended to reduce the effects of interest rate changes 
based on interest rates at  and our swap agreements in effect on  december  and  we estimate that a increase in interest rates on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan  after considering the effect of our interest rate swap agreements  would decrease annual future earnings and cash flows by approximately million and million  respectively 
we further estimate that a decrease in interest rates on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan  after considering the effect of our interest rate swap agreements in effect on december  and  would increase annual future earnings and cash flows by approximately million and million  respectively 
a increase in interest rates on our secured debt and interest rate swap agreements would decrease their aggregate fair value by approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
a decrease in interest rates on our secured debt and interest rate swap agreements would increase their aggregate fair value by approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost and our interest rate swap agreements in effect on december  and 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  we would consider taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure 
we have exposure to equity price market risk because of our equity investments in certain publicly traded companies and privately held entities 
we classify investments in publicly traded companies as available for sale and  consequently  record them on our balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of comprehensive income or loss 
investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the cost method because we do not influence any of the operating or financial policies of the entities in which we invest 
for all investments  we recognize other than temporary declines in value against earnings in the same period the decline in value was deemed to have occurred 
in  we recorded non cash impairment charges of  to write down certain investments for which we deemed the decline in fair value to be other than temporary 
there is no assurance that future declines in values will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations 
by way of example  a decrease in the fair value of our equity investments as of december  and would decrease their fair value by approximately million and million  respectively
