general the company is one of the premier suppliers of products and services to the aerospace industry worldwide  including the provisioning and the supply of aircraft parts and components  and supply chain management services 
the company also builds custom hose assemblies  and performs overhaul and repair services for brakes and starters generators 
the company recorded an increase in revenues for the year ended january  for the full year  despite higher revenues  the company experienced an operating loss resulting from declining gross margins  lower freight billings  and increased expenses to effect significant changes in the way the business is managed 
the company believes it maintains a strong balance sheet  although cash levels decreased primarily due to the operating losses experienced during the year  expenditures for equipment and enterprise software  and making accelerated payments to obtain vendor price discounts 
the company believes that its results show that it continues to take market share from its competitors  as it managed to grow even though the industry outlook remains cautious for growth 
results for the three months ended january  were mixed as the company increased revenue due to an improved economy  but experienced lower gross margins 
the company also experienced higher expenses and charges  primarily due to changes in operations initiated by management that are not anticipated to recur 
recovery in the industry has been gradual  and overall business activity in the aerospace industry continues to be influenced by several factors  including higher fuel prices 
although the extent and timing of further increases in market activity is uncertain  the company continues to look for opportunities for new markets and revenues  increased margins  improved cost controls  and expanded service offerings 
the company has entered into a service arrangement with an authorized piper distributor pursuant to which the company provides services  including parts supply services and logistics services 
this has mitigated the effect of the december  termination of the company s distributorship with new piper aircraft  inc during the year ended january  the company  due to the loss incurred for the year  and in accordance with requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for income taxes  recorded a non cash deferred income tax charge of million to establish a full valuation allowance against its net deferred income tax assets as it was more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the establishment of the valuation allowance is not a reflection of the future or long term profitability of the company  and the company expects that it will reverse in future years if financial results increase sufficiently to support the value of the assets 
during the first quarter ended april   the company adopted fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
pursuant to fas  goodwill is not amortized but is tested periodically for impairment using discounted cash flows and other fair value methodologies 
upon adoption of fas  the company was required to perform transitional impairment tests relating to its goodwill existing as of february   the date of adoption 
as a result  upon adoption of fas  the company took a non cash charge of  net of applicable income tax benefit of  or per share  to write off the carrying value of its goodwill 
no charge was required under previous generally accepted accounting principles  which were based upon undiscounted cash flows 
the adoption of fas represented a change in accounting principle  and the cumulative effect  net of the applicable income tax benefit  has been shown on a separate line in the consolidated statements of operations 
critical accounting policies the company is required to provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it is important to the company s financial condition and results  and requires judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
the process of preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the use of judgments  estimates and assumptions to determine the measurement of revenues and expenses  and the realizable value of certain assets and liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon information available at the time the estimates or assumptions are made 
the estimates and assumptions could change significantly as conditions within and beyond management s control change 
therefore  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates 
the most significant estimates made in preparing the company s financial statements include revenue recognition  the determination of the allowance for doubtful trade receivables  the allowance for excess and obsolete inventories  deferred income tax asset valuations  the valuation of goodwill  and  in prior years  estimates made relating to discontinued operations  including the determination of the amount of gain or loss upon disposition 
the following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies and the related judgments  estimates and assumptions utilized in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements 
a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition the company s net sales consist of sales of services to the aviation industry  including parts and components supply services  supply chain management services  and component overhaul and repair services 
net sales are recorded when parts and components are shipped and title transfers to the customer  when supply chain management services have been provided to the customer  or when overhauled and repaired items are completed and shipped back to the customer 
shipping and handling billed to customers are included in net sales 
the terms and nature of supply chain management services are stipulated in a long term contract between the company and the customer 
the company provides its facilities  personnel and systems to provide the services at less cost to the customer 
in providing services where the company distributes inventory on behalf of its customer  the company may use its own inventory or hold its customers inventory without taking ownership of such inventory 
in cases where the company does not take ownership of its customers inventory  net sales generally are recognized as a fee based on the sales value of the product shipped through the company s facilities  and not the sales value of the product itself 
alternatively  the company  when providing services to handle customer s inventory without taking ownership  can take a fee based on the cost of providing services  and not on the sales value of the product 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful trade receivables is established based on estimates of the amount of uncollectible trade receivables  utilizing financial formulas based principally upon historical experience  the credit worthiness of the customer  the age of the account  the estimated risk that the account can be collected  and specific identification 
collection of trade receivables is affected by aviation industry and market trends  overall economic trends and conditions  and customers credit issues and financial condition 
changes in any of these factors may have a significant negative impact upon the estimated allowance  and the company s financial performance 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventories inventories generally consist of aircraft parts and components  and are valued at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method 
provisions were made in each period for the estimated effect of excess and obsolete inventories based upon financial formulas that took into account quantities  costs  the age of the inventory on hand  historical and projected sales  and other inventory movements  adjusted for known or estimated factors such as new product lines and product return allowances 
during the three months ended july   as a result of normal review procedures  the company adjusted the methodology for estimating the allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory that makes the estimate more objective  and efficient to calculate  by applying percentages based on historical experiences of inventory in various age classifications  and eliminating the practice of making adjustments based on historical and projected sales  or other inventory movements due to new product lines and product return allowances 
actual excess and obsolete inventories may differ significantly from such estimates  and such differences could have a significant negative impact on the estimated allowance  and the company s financial performance 
goodwill goodwill arises from the excess of the purchase price paid over the underlying fair value of assets acquired in transactions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
goodwill was recognized upon first aviation s acquisition of api s business in and upon the acquisition of superior s distribution business in a significant amount of judgment is used to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and to allocate the purchase price to the underlying assets and liabilities  including the recognition of liabilities incurred directly as a result of the acquisition 
most of the assumptions and estimates utilized in this process were based upon known factors and exposures  historical information and management s experience 
deferred income taxes the company uses the liability method to account for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and are estimated using the enacted tax rates and laws that are estimated to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the realization of the assets is subject to estimates and judgments  and may change based upon a variety of factors  including future profitability of the company and tax law changes 
if an asset is not deemed more likely than not to be fully realizable  a valuation allowance must be established against all or part of the asset 
in addition  fas requires the establishment of a valuation allowance under certain conditions 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
the cost will be measured based on the fair value of the instruments issued 
sfas no 
r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
as originally issued in  sfas no 
established as preferable the fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
however  that statement permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance in opinion  as long as the footnotes to financial statements disclosed what net income loss would have been had the preferable fair value based method been used 
the company will be required to apply sfas no 
r at the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june   and we plan to adopt it effective january  results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentages of the company s net sales that certain income and expense items represent 
year ended january  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses corporate expenses income loss from operations interest income interest and other expenses income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes income loss from continuing operations cumulative effect of accounting change net income loss year ended january  compared to year ended january  net sales net sales for the year ended january  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended january  net sales increased in all customer sectors  as economic conditions improved for the general economy as a whole for the year  leading to greater flight activity than the previous year  and therefore increases in maintenance and repairs 
the increase in sales occurred across all geographic regions with the most significant improvement in sales growth occurring in asia and latin america at and respectively 
european revenue growth  while positive  lagged the other regions of the world at 
freight revenue is a component of net sales and it represents freight billed to customers 
freight revenue declined for year ended january  by to million from million for the prior year ended january  this decline was due primarily to increased customer incentives resulting from promotional activities and industry competition 
this had an adverse effect on gross profit margin as explained below under the caption gross profit 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of costs of inventory sold  direct costs to overhaul and repair parts and components  and direct costs of providing services 
freight costs for parts and components sold are also included in cost of sales 
costs of sales for the year ended january  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended january  the increase in cost of sales was due primarily to the increase in net sales of parts and components 
in addition  a  increase to inventory reserves was recorded in the quarter ended july  as described under the caption critical accounting policies in the section allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales increased for the twelve months ended january   to from  for the twelve month period ended january  the increase in the percentage of cost of sales compared to net sales for the twelve months ended january  compared to the comparable twelve month period  was due to the reasons described above  as well as higher growth in sales of products and components supply services versus supply chain management services contracts  the latter representing a larger share of the revenue mix in the prior year period versus the current year period 
gross profit gross profit for the twelve months ended january  increased million or to million  compared to gross profit for the twelve months ended january  gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the twelve month period ended january   from for the comparable twelve month period ended january  gross profit margin for the twelve month period ended january   decreased compared to the comparable period of the prior year principally due to the accrual for an increase in the inventory reserves  as mentioned above under the caption cost of sales  as well as an increase in the mix in sales of parts and components supply services which have a lower gross profit margin relative to supply chain management services 
the increase in net freight expense  as described below  contributed to the reduction in gross profit for the twelve months ended january  compared to the twelve months ended january  gross profit is also impacted by net freight expense  which represents freight expense recorded in cost of sales  less freight billed to customers in net sales 
net freight expense decreased gross profit by for the twelve months ended january   compared to a decrease of in the comparable period 
the decrease was due primarily to increased customer incentives from promotional activities offering customers reduced or zero freight on shipments 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended january  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended january  the increases for the twelve months ended january   over the twelve month period ended january   is due primarily to increases in salaries and payroll costs related to additional sales personnel  higher sales commissions  sales related travel expenses  severance and relocation expense for personnel changes  increased legal fees  the expiration of property tax incentives  and expenses incurred for the implementation of a new customer initiative requiring additional temporary warehouse personnel 
offsetting these increases were reductions to bad debt expense from a reduction in the reserves for accounts receivable  and lower depreciation expense 
the reduction in the accounts receivable reserves that resulted during normal review procedures was due to a change in the company s estimate for bad debts resulting from changes in estimated collections based on improving customer payment trends  and the overall improving economy 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were for the twelve months ended january   unchanged from the twelve months ended january  corporate expenses corporate expenses for the twelve months ended january  increased  or  to million  from the million incurred during the twelve months ended january  for the twelve months ended january  versus the prior year  the company incurred an additional  in legal expenses related to updating our corporate governance policies under new sec and nasdaq exchange rules  responding to a dissident shareholder s proposal  activities in connection with a proxy contest  and for the annual meeting 
other increases in the twelve months ended january  versus the twelve months ended january  related to salary and payroll expenses  travel expenses  insurance charges  and consulting services related to changes in management  which were partially offset by lower expenses in other categories over the prior year period 
interest income and interest and other expenses during the twelve months ended january   interest income from investing the company s cash in short term investments  decreased by  to  over the comparable prior year period 
the decrease in income was due to lower cash balances to invest  and lower interest rates due to a revised investment strategy minimizing market risk for the year ended january  over the twelve month period ended january  interest and other expenses resulted in income of  for the twelve months ended january  versus expense in the amount of  in the comparable prior year period due primarily to reductions in other expenses and less foreign exchange gains 
provision for income taxes the company recorded a provision for income taxes related to foreign income tax expense estimates for operations in canada and the philippines 
the company does not record a tax benefit for us tax purposes on any operating losses incurred due to the deferred tax valuation allowance recorded as it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
net income loss and net income loss per share the company had a net loss of million or per share for the twelve months ended january   compared to net income of  for the full year ended january  the net loss was due to the reasons described in the preceding sections 
year ended january  compared to year ended january  net sales net sales for the year ended january  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended january  net sales increased primarily due to increased sales of parts and components to general aviation customers  as economic conditions improved slightly for the general economy as a whole for the year  leading to slightly more flight activity than the previous year  and increases in maintenance and repairs 
sales to airlines were still affected by depressed industry conditions  and continued additional security measures that especially affected the commercial airline markets 
in addition  as a result of economic and industry conditions  the company previously had tightened its credit policies  and this further contributed to the decline in airline sales 
the majority of the increase in sales occurred in the us market  but a significant improvement in sales growth occurred in asia  europe and canada 
sales to the latin america region continued to decline  partially due to continued economic weakness in that region  as well as maintaining previously tightened credit policies toward customers in that region 
freight revenue is a component of net sales and it represents freight billed to customers 
freight revenue for the year ended january  declined to million from million for the year ended january  this was due to increased customer incentives resulting from promotional activities and industry competition 
this had an adverse effect on gross profit as explained below in the section gross profit 
sales to original equipment manufacturers oem s also increased over the prior year as the company continues to increase sales of supply chain management services 
the increase in revenues from supply chain management services  is due to expanded offerings to existing customers for the year 
these contracts often are based upon a fee relative to the services provided  so the impact on sales is less than if the company was also selling the product itself 
however  the company s investment in its personnel  facilities and systems are scalable  so as services contracts increase throughput the company s capacity utilization will improve 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of costs of inventory sold  direct costs to overhaul and repair parts and components  and direct costs of providing services 
freight costs for parts and components sold are also included in cost of sales 
costs of sales for the year ended january  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended january  the increase in cost of sales is due primarily to the increase in net sales of parts and components

the increase in gross profit was due principally to the increase in net sales  due to the reasons described above under net sales 
adding to this increase  which also was the reason for the increase in the gross profit margin  was an increase in gross profit from services contracts  which have a higher gross margin  as explained below 
a significant portion of the costs relating to services contracts are indirect costs  including indirect personnel  warehouse and related  and systems  and these costs are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
therefore  gross profit margins for services sales will be higher than for product sales 
gross profit is also impacted by net freight expenses  which represents freight expense recorded in cost of sales  less freight billed to customers in net sales 
net freight expenses decreased gross profit by for the year ended january   compared to a decrease of in the prior year ended january   due primarily to increased customer incentives from promotional activities offering customers reduced  or eliminated  freight on shipments

selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended january  decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended january  the decrease is due principally to decreases in charges for estimated bad debts  offset by increases in charges for legal fees due to increased litigation  insurance rate increases  expiration of local government property tax incentives  and increased advertising expenses 
corporate expenses corporate expenses for the year ended january  increased million to million from million for the year ended january  the increase was due principally to legal expenses related to general corporate matters  and costs associated with the proxy contest conducted by a large shareholder for the annual meeting 
interest income and interest and other expenses interest income of million earned during the year ended january  was derived from investing the company s cash in short term investments 
the decrease from the million earned during the year ended january   was due principally to lower cash balances in fiscal year as a result of a cash dividend paid by the company on january  interest and other expense was nil for the year ended january   from million for the year ended january   due to exchange gains on foreign currency transactions by the canadian subsidiary offsetting expenses for interest and other expenses that were essentially unchanged from the amounts recorded for prior year ended january  provision benefit for income taxes for the fiscal year ended january   the company recorded a benefit from income taxes of  the benefit was from a  credit from a us federal refund received that is offset by foreign income tax expense estimates for operations in canada and the philippines 
the accrual for the refund received was offset in its entirety by the valuation reserve that had been recorded by the company during the prior year  but changes to us federal income tax regulations during the year just ended allowed the company to carry back the benefit to prior years  and receive a refund 
the effective benefit rate of for the year ended january  is the result of the tax benefit from the us federal refund received  state tax benefits  and changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance due primarily to depreciation expenses 
income loss from continuing operations for the year ended january  the company earned  from continuing operations  compared to a loss of million for the year ended january  the increase in income is primarily the result of higher sales and gross profit  and reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses as described in the foregoing paragraphs  as well as the recording of the tax valuation reserve in the prior year 
net income loss and net income loss per share the company earned  which is per share for the year ended january   as compared to a net loss of million  or per share for the year ended january  the net income and increase in net income are due principally to the reasons described above

the company funds its liquidity requirements with a combination of cash on hand  cash flows from operations  and from borrowings 
cash and cash equivalents at any time may consist of a combination of demand deposits  money market or short term  high grade bond funds  and short term certificates of deposit 
the reduction in cash for the year ended january  was principally the result of the operating loss  purchases of equipment and software  and making accelerated payments to obtain vendor price discounts 
the company believes it maintains a strong balance sheet 
the company s cash provided by used in operations for the years ended january   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
cash used in operations for the year ended january  was impacted by the operating losses  an increase in accounts receivable due to the increase in sales for the year  and the reduction in payables resulting from the company pursuing vendor price discounts aggressively in the fourth quarter
