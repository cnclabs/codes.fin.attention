sales revenues are derived from sales of food  beer  wine  liquor and non alcoholic beverages 
approximately of combined sales were food and were beverage 
sales revenues from restaurant operations are primarily influenced by the number of restaurants in operation at any time  the timing of the opening of such restaurants and the sales volumes of each restaurant 
management and license fee revenues are derived from individually negotiated arrangements by which we manage restaurants on behalf of third parties or license to third parties the right to operate daily grill restaurants 
management and license fees are primarily influenced by the number of management and license arrangements in place  the negotiated management or license fee and the revenues of the managed or licensed restaurants 
management and license fees typically range from five to eight percent of gross sales of the subject restaurants 
revenues derived from reimbursement of operating expenses of managed outlets relate to contractual undertakings relating to managed restaurants wherein we assume responsibility for some or all operating expenses of managed restaurants and the restaurant owner undertakes to reimburse all of those expenses 
pursuant to the guidance of eitf and eitf  we are considered to be the primary obligor with respect to the reimbursed expenses and  as such  report the reimbursed expenses as revenues with the expenses being reported as reimbursed costs under operating expenses 
expenses are comprised primarily of cost of food and beverages  restaurant operating expenses  including payroll  rent and occupancy costs and reimbursed costs 
our largest expenses are payroll and the cost of food and beverages  which is primarily a function of the price of the various ingredients utilized in preparing the menu items offered at our restaurants 
restaurant operating expenses consist primarily of wages paid to part time and full time employees  rent  utilities  insurance and taxes 
reimbursed costs are costs incurred on behalf of managed restaurants that are reimbursable by the managed restaurant

restatement of financial statements the company began a review of its lease accounting policies following announcements in february that the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission sec issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants regarding lease accounting issues 
as a result of our review  the company has revised its accounting for leases in and restated its historical financial statements as of december  and for each of the two years in the period then ended  as well as the historical financial data as of and for the fiscal years and and the and quarterly financial data  to correct for these errors in its lease accounting 
the company has also corrected the accounting for complimentary meals and promotional activities as part of this restatement process 
historically  the company recognized straight line rents and amortized lessor lease incentives using the initial non cancelable term of the lease commencing on the date rent payments began 
under generally accepted accounting principles  the company should have recognized rent expense net of the related lessor lease incentive amortization on a straight line basis over the term of the lease as defined in sfas no 
which begins on the later of when the company had access to the site or the lease is executed 
the impact of correctly calculating rent expense and lessor lease incentive amortization was to increase restaurant operating expenses and decrease general and administrative expenses by  and  respectively  for fiscal year  to decrease restaurant operating expenses and general and administrative expenses by  and  respectively  for fiscal year  to decrease restaurant operating expenses and general and administrative expenses by  and  respectively  for fiscal year  and to increase restaurant operating expenses and decrease general and administrative expenses by  and  respectively  for fiscal year the company also increased other current assets by  and  in fiscal years and  respectively  to recognize a receivable for tenant improvement allowances to be received  increased fixed assets by  in fiscal year to recognize additional construction in progress and increased long term liabilities by    and  for deferred rent and lease incentives  to properly reflect the correct lease accounting in each of the fiscal years   and  respectively 
in closing the books and records  the company also reviewed the estimated useful lives that it was using to amortize its leasehold improvements 
in the case of six restaurants  it was found that the incorrect lives had been used 
the company has revised the amortization period to reflect the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the initial lease term 
the impact of the change is to increase depreciation and amortization expense by    and  in fiscal years     respectively 
a portion of the above adjustments was recorded on the books of the llc s in which we have a majority ownership or we consolidate under fin r 
as discussed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements the company allocates results to the minority interests based on the underlying economics of the investment 
the impact of the above adjustments increased decreased the amount of loss allocated to the minority interests by   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively  and increased the amount of income allocated to the minority interests by  in fiscal year during fourth quarter of  the company eliminated amounts that had previously been recorded as restaurant sales revenue arising from complimentary meals and promotional activities 
the company s previous method of recording these activities as restaurant sales revenue at the full retail price of each item with a corresponding increase in operating expense is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
historically the amounts associated with complimentary meals and promotional activities have been recorded as restaurant revenues  with an offsetting amount in restaurant operations and corporate general and administrative expenses 
as revised  the company has eliminated the complimentary portion of meals and promotional activities from revenues and operating expenses 
as a result of these adjustments  revenue and expenses were decreased by million  million  million and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
these adjustments have no impact on previously reported net income 
the individual per share impact of each adjustment noted above was not considered material 
the overall impact on earnings per share is shown below in the tables that follow 
the above revisions impacted the balance sheets  statements of operations and statements of cash flows for each of the fiscal years to the impact of all the above is as follows the following table reflects the effects of the restatement on the consolidated balance sheet december  as previously reported restated prepaid expenses and other current assets   total current assets   furniture  equipment and improvements  net   total assets   other long term liabilities   total liabilities   minority interest   accumulated deficit   total stockholders equity   total liabilities equity   december  as previously reported restated prepaid expenses and other current assets   total current assets   furniture  equipment and improvements  net   total assets   other long term liabilities   total liabilities   minority interest   accumulated deficit   total stockholders equity   total liabilities equity   december  as previously reported restated furniture  equipment and improvements  net   total assets   other long term liabilities   total liabilities   minority interest   accumulated deficit   total stockholders equity   total liabilities equity   december  as previously reported restated furniture  equipment and improvements  net   total assets   other long term liabilities   total liabilities   minority interest   accumulated deficit   total stockholders equity   total liabilities equity   the following table reflects the effects of the restatement on the consolidated statement of operations december  december  as previously restated as previously restated reported reported sales     total revenues     restaurant operating expenses     general administrative     depreciation amortization     total operating expenses     income loss from operations     loss before taxes minority interest     loss before minority interest     minority interest     net income loss     net income loss applicable to common stock     net income loss per share applicable to common stock basic net income loss diluted net income loss december  december  as previously restated as previously restated reported reported sales     total revenues     restaurant operating expenses     general administrative     depreciation amortization     total operating expenses     income from operations     income loss before taxes minority interest     loss before minority interest     minority interest     net income loss     net income loss applicable to common stock     net income loss per share applicable to common stock basic net income diluted net income includes cost of sales amounts that were not included in the total operating expenses subtotal in prior financial statements

when entering new markets where we have not yet established a market presence  sales levels are expected to be lower than in existing markets where we have a concentration of restaurants and high customer awareness 
although our experience in developing markets indicates that the opening of multiple restaurants within a particular market results in increased market share  decreases in comparable restaurant sales could result 
cost reimbursements increased in primarily due to the full year operation of portland daily grill  the opening of long beach daily grill and improved sales at other managed restaurants

interest is at the bank s variable reference rate 
although we were in default of a covenant at year end  the bank has granted us a waiver 
we held preliminary talks with the bank to renew its existing credit lines for another year 
given the expected capital expenditures of approximately  net of million in both landlord reimbursements and joint venture contributions for the new restaurants planned for and refurbishments on existing restaurants  management believes we will be able to meet our expected obligations from our existing cash flow from operations if it is unable to secure bank financing

capital expenditures 
management anticipates that new non hotel based restaurants will cost between million and million per restaurant to build and open depending upon the location and available tenant allowances 
hotel based restaurants may involve remodeling existing facilities  substantial capital contributions from the hotel operators and other factors which will cause the cost to us of opening such restaurants to be less than our cost to build and open non hotel based restaurants 
capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in capital expenditures in fiscal are expected to be between million and million  primarily for the development of new restaurants  capital replacements and refurbishing existing restaurants 
the amount of actual capital expenditures will be dependent upon  among other things  the proportion of free standing versus hotel based properties as hotel based restaurants are expected to generally require lower capital investment on our part 
in addition  if we open more  or less  restaurants than we currently anticipate  our capital requirements will increase  or decrease  accordingly 
in april we signed a lease for an owned restaurant in santa monica  california 
the restaurant opened march  construction of the restaurant was paid for through a million tenant improvement allowance 
in june we signed a lease for a majority owned restaurant in los angeles  california 
the restaurant is scheduled to open in the second quarter of construction of the restaurant will be paid for through a  tenant improvement allowance  a  capital contribution from the minority owner and a  capital contribution by us 
convertible securities 
we previously issued various convertible securities  warrants and common stock to finance restaurant openings in and shares of series ii convertible preferred stock issued in that transaction remained outstanding at december  all warrants issued in that transaction expired in the series ii convertible preferred stock is convertible into common stock commencing one year from the date of issuance at the greater of i per share  or ii of the average closing price of our common stock for the five trading days immediately prior to the date of conversion  provided  however  that the conversion price shall in no event exceed per share 
the series ii convertible preferred stock is entitled to receive an annual dividend equal to per share payable on conversion or redemption in cash or  at our option  in common stock at the then applicable conversion price 
the series ii convertible preferred stock is subject to redemption  in whole or in part  at our option on or after the second anniversary of issuance at  per share 
accrued dividends in arrears total  at december  and  at december  starwood alliance in july  we completed a transaction with starwood hotels and resorts worldwide  inc pursuant to which we sold  shares of restricted common stock and  stock warrants at to starwood for  concurrently  we sold an additional  shares of restricted common stock and  stock purchase warrants for to other strategic investors for  proceeds reflected in the financial statements are net of transaction costs 
in conjunction with the investment by starwood  we and starwood entered into a development agreement under which we and starwood agreed to jointly develop our restaurant properties in starwood hotels 
under the starwood development agreement  either we or starwood may propose to develop a daily grill  grill or city bar and grill restaurant in a starwood hotel property 
if the parties agree in principal to the development of a restaurant  the parties will attempt to negotiate either a management agreement or a license agreement with respect to the operation of the restaurant 
under the development agreement  we are obligated to issue to starwood warrants to acquire a number of shares of our common stock equal to four percent of the outstanding shares upon the attainment of certain development milestones 
such warrants are issuable upon execution of management agreements and or license agreements relating to the development and operation  and the commencement of operation  of an aggregate of five  ten  fifteen and twenty of our branded restaurants 
if the market price of our common stock on the date the warrants are to be issued is greater than the market price on the date of the development agreement  the warrants will be exercisable at a price equal to the greater of of the market price as of the date such warrant becomes issuable  or the market price on the date of the development agreement 
if the market price of our common stock on the date the warrants are to be issued is less than the market price on the date of the development agreement  the warrants will be exercisable at a price equal to the market price as of the date such warrants become issuable 
the warrants will be exercisable for a period of five years 
in addition to the warrants described above  if and when the aggregate number of restaurants operated under the development agreement exceeds of the total daily grill  grill and city grill branded restaurants  we will be obligated to issue to starwood a warrant to purchase a number of shares of our common stock equal to of the outstanding shares on that date exercisable for a period of five years at a price equal to the market price at that date 
on each anniversary of that date at which the restaurants operated under the development agreement continues to exceed the threshold  for so long as the development agreement remains effective  we shall issue to starwood additional warrants to purchase of the outstanding shares on that date at an exercise price equal to the market price on that date 
following the events of september   starwood substantially curtailed new development activities and only two management agreements have  as yet  been entered into under the development agreement 
exclusivity portions of the agreement have terminated due to the lack of performance on starwood s part 
termination of pizzeria uno operations in april  we sold our cherry hill  new jersey pizza restaurant  the last of our pizzeria uno franchised restaurants  for net proceeds of  restaurant closings in april  we closed our encino  california daily grill restaurant when the lease expired 
assets of the restaurant were sold for net proceeds of in the third quarter of  we terminated the licensed operation of our san jose city bar and grill restaurant 
short term financing requirements management believes that we have adequate resources on hand and operating cash flow to sustain operations for at least the following months through march we project increased operating cash flows in which  when added to existing cash balances  will allow us to meet all operating  investing and financing needs 
such projections are based on sales increases due to store openings  as well as modest increases in same store sales 
in the event of a decline in sales  as a result of deterioration of the economy or the hospitality industry or other factors  management believes it can respond to such a decrease in sales through cost controls  reductions in discretionary capital improvements and borrowings under the existing credit facility 
in order to fund the opening of additional restaurants  we might require additional capital that might be raised through the issuance of debt or equity securities  or the formation of additional investment loan arrangements  or a combination thereof 
we presently have no commitments in that regard 
see business business expansion and management s discussion and analysis certain factors affecting future operating results 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
principals of consolidation and minority interests our restaurant operations are conducted through multiple wholly owned subsidiaries as well as through four majority owned limited liability companies and through a owned joint venture 
our consolidated financial statements include balance sheet and income statement items  after eliminating inter company accounts and transactions  of each wholly owned and majority owned subsidiary and entities consolidated under fin the allocated interest of the earnings or loss of majority owned subsidiaries attributable to the minority owners of those subsidiaries is reflected in a single statement of operations entry  with minority interests in earnings being a reduction in net income and minority interests in losses being an increase in net income 
the proportionate interest in the equity of majority owned subsidiaries attributable to the minority owners of those subsidiaries is reflected as a single balance sheet entry between liabilities and stockholders equity 
we allocate profits and losses to the minority interest in our majority owned subsidiaries based on the underlying economics of the investment 
these may or may not reflect our ownership percentage and can be inconsistent with the allocation provisions specified in the joint venture agreements 
where there is a disparity among the ownership percentages  the terms of the agreements and the underlying economics  we utilize a hypothetical liquidation model to allocate profits and losses 
under this model  all of the ventures assets and liabilities as reflected in the balance sheet are assumed to be realized at their gaap carrying values 
the hypothetical liquidating proceeds are calculated at the end of each period and applied to the capital accounts as would occur under a true liquidation scenario 
the change in this balance from period to period represents the investors share of the income or loss 
effective december  the first day of fiscal year  we retroactively adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
under fin  an entity is considered to be a variable interest entity vie when it has equity investors which lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest  or its capital is insufficient to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
consolidation of a vie by an investor is required when it is determined that the investor is the primary beneficiary and will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses or residual returns if they occur 
management has assessed all entities which are not wholly owned by us to determine if these entities would be considered vies and whether we would be considered the primary beneficiary 
upon adoption of fin  it was determined that all of the following entities would be considered vies the san jose grill llc  chicago the grill on the alley llc  the grill on hollywood llc  the daily grill at continental park llc  and the universal citywalk daily grill joint partnership 
we determined that we are the primary beneficiary for all these entities 
if we had not retroactively adopted fin  it was determined that the san jose grill  chicago grill and south bay daily grill would not have been consolidated because the minority interests have rights which preclude consolidation 
the minority interests rights in the san jose llc were deemed to be material in that they vote on the approval of the construction  capital and annual operating budgets as well as refinancing in excess of  the minority interests rights at chicago are similar to san jose except they do not approve the operating budget 
they do however approve construction and capital budgets 
the rights of the minority interest in south bay are also considered material  as borrowings in excess of  require the minority interest s approval 
the minority interest in hollywood has no such rights  and therefore  it was determined that we controlled the entity and consolidation would be appropriate 
in the restaurant business ongoing capital expenditures are considered regular and routine  and as such  requiring approval on them from the minority investor is evidence of material control 
impairment of long lived assets we review all long lived assets on a regular basis to determine if there has been impairment in the value of those assets 
if  upon review  it is determined that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable  we will record a charge to earnings and reduce the value of the asset on the balance sheet to the amount determined to be recoverable 
for purposes of evaluating recoverability of long lived assets  the recoverability test is performed using undiscounted cash flows of the individual restaurants and consolidated undiscounted net cash flows for long lived assets not identifiable to individual restaurants compared to the related carrying value 
if the undiscounted operating income is less than the carrying value  the amount of the impairment  if any  will be determined by comparing the carrying value of each asset with its fair value 
fair value is generally based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
based on our review of our presently operating restaurants and other long lived assets  during the fiscal year ended december   we recorded no impairments of our long lived assets 
valuation of accounts receivable we review all of our accounts receivable on a regular basis to determine the collectability of each account based on age  response to collection efforts  and other factors 
we establish a reserve for those accounts where collection seems doubtful 
if a determination is made that the customer will definitely not pay  the amount is written off against the reserve 
based on our review at december   the current reserve for uncollectable accounts receivable is adequate 
recording reimbursable costs we operate a number of restaurants under management agreements whereby we are responsible for all aspects of restaurant operation 
for our services  we typically receive a management fee based on a percentage of revenue and an incentive fee which is usually a profit sharing arrangement 
under the terms of the management agreements  we are hired as an independent contractor and are responsible for all debts and liabilities of the restaurant 
additionally  all employees are employees of grill concepts  not the individual restaurant 
although payroll and other operating expenses are paid out of an agency bank account belonging to the restaurant  based on the weight of the indicators identified in eift  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  and eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  we consider ourselves the primary obligor in these arrangements 
accordingly  we recognize restaurant expenses of the managed outlets in our financial statements and record the reimbursement for such expenses as revenues 
hrp the company concluded that the options relating to hrp would be defined as a derivative under fas however  because the purchase price was based on a floating price  it was determined that the value of the put and call would be identical so long as the formula resulted in a representative fair value of hrp 
the company concluded that the multiple was based on fair value because the original formula was negotiated between two parties 
this fact was reconfirmed when the hrp agreement was amended approximately three years later at the time the company entered into a development agreement with starwood hotels and the multiple for the hrp put and call options did not change 
we believe the multiple used in the formula to be within a tolerable range of those found in the marketplace 
therefore  management asserts that the formula is a reasonable approximation of fair value of the hrp business that results in the put and call options having similar values 
additionally  because fair market puts and calls have little value on their own  any asset and liability related to these would be insignificant 
no derivative accounting is necessary in these circumstances and therefore  no accounting recognition has been made in the financial statements 
the company will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of formula to market conditions to ensure it represents fair market value  and will continue to evaluate the formula going forward and to the extent it no longer represents fair market value  will account for the derivative appropriately 
certain factors affecting future operating results this form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of our actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
certain factors that might cause such a difference include the following adverse weather conditions and other conditions affecting agricultural output which may cause shortages of key food ingredients and volatility of food prices and which  in turn  may reduce operating margins  changes in consumer tastes  demographics and adverse economic conditions which may result in reduced frequency of dining at our restaurants  the dependence on key personnel and ability to attract and retain qualified management and restaurant personnel to support existing operations and future growth  regulatory developments  particularly relating to labor matters ie  minimum wage  health insurance and other benefit requirements  health and safety conditions  service of alcoholic beverages and taxation  which could increase the cost of restaurant operations  establishment of market position and consumer acceptance in new markets in light of intense competition in the restaurant industry and the geographic separation of senior management from such markets  potential delays in securing sites for new restaurants and delays in opening restaurants which may entail additional costs and lower revenues than would otherwise exist in the absence of such delays  the availability of capital to fund future restaurant openings  rising energy costs and the occurrence of rolling blackouts in california which may result in higher occupancy costs and periodic restaurant closures 
in addition to the foregoing  the following specific factors may affect the company s future operating results the anticipated opening of additional daily grill and grill locations is expected to result in the incurrence of various pre opening expenses and high initial operating costs which may adversely impact earnings during the first year of operations of such restaurants 
however  management anticipates that each of such operations can be operated profitably within the first year of operations and that the opening of each of the restaurants presently contemplated will improve revenues and profitability 
in order to better manage the cost of our workers compensation expense  commencing in  we altered our workers compensation coverage to substantially increase our per event and aggregate deductibles 
as a result  we expect to reduce our recurring cost of workers compensation insurance 
on the other hand  we will have substantially higher exposure to losses resulting from claims under that policy should those claims exceed our prior deductible levels 
the employees of the chicago restaurant are members of the hotel employees and restaurant employees union afl cio 
the union contract covering the chicago grill will expire in august under a new union contract  our labor costs are expected to increase slightly 
we are presently party to litigation in which a former hourly restaurant employee has alleged violations of california labor laws with respect to providing meal and rest breaks 
while we believe that all of our employees were provided with the opportunity to take all required meal and rest breaks  many restaurant operators in california have incurred substantial expenses in settling similar claims and we may incur substantial expenses in connection with defending or settling the pending litigation 
new accounting requirements in april  the eitf reached final consensus on eitf  participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
 which requires companies that have participating securities to calculate earnings per share using the two class method 
this method requires the allocation of undistributed earnings to the common shares and participating securities based on the proportion of undistributed earnings that each would have been entitled to had all the period s earnings been distributed 
eitf is effective for fiscal periods beginning after march  and earnings per share reported in prior periods presented must be retroactively adjusted in order to comply with eitf the company adopted eitf for the quarter ended june   however there has been no impact on the company s financial statements as the preferred shares are not participating securities 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb no 
 and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
as permitted by statement  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method may have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share above we expect to adopt statement r in the first quarter of impact of inflation substantial increases in costs and expenses  particularly food  supplies  labor and operating expenses  could have a significant impact on our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to customers 
we do not believe that inflation has materially affected our operating results during the past two years 
a majority of our employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws and various laws that allow for credits to that wage 
our cost of operations have been affected by several increases in the federal and state minimum wage in recent years 
in addition  further increases in the minimum wage are also being discussed by the federal and various state governments 
although we have been able to and will continue to attempt to pass along increases in costs through food and beverage price increases  there can be no assurance that all such increases can be reflected in our prices or that increased prices will be absorbed by customers without diminishing  to some degree  customer spending at its restaurants 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on funded debt 
this exposure relates to our credit line facility 
at december  there are no borrowings under the credit line 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the lender s prime rate 
a hypothetical interest rate change would not have a material impact on our results of operations
