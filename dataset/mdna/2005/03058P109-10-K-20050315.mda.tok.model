table of contents bank awb  a washington state chartered community bank  conducts its banking business through forty two locations throughout eastern and central washington and northern idaho 
awb offers a full range of financial services to commercial and consumer customers  including industrial and agricultural enterprises  government entities  not for profit entities  and individuals 
these services include short term and medium term loans  revolving credit lines  inventory and accounts receivable financing  mortgages  equipment leases  savings programs  checking accounts  personal loans  and bank credit cards  as well as a variety of account access programs such as debit cards  online banking  and online bill payment 
the bank s services are primarily directed to the communities in which its financial centers are located and are targeted at the needs of commercial  private banking and consumer customers in these communities 
business strategy awbc pursues a profit based growth strategy  the key components of which include increasing market share in existing communities through hands on participation and active engagement in each community 
expanding the markets served through new products and services to serve an expanded audience 
providing service to awbc s customers that is based on finding solutions and providing accurate  timely  and intelligent answers 
expanding the markets served through de novo branching and acquisitions increasing market share in existing communities through hands on participation and active engagement in each community 
awbc management believes the bank is engaged in each community as a hands on partner focused on improving quality of life 
awbc s position as a local  community bank sends a powerful message that distinguishes it immediately in the minds of customers  prospects  and community leaders 
the company s smaller size makes it more adaptable than national or large scale regional banks 
customers aren t boxed in by the bureaucracies of the larger  national and regional banks  awbc extends a certain financial flexibility to its customers that can only come from local leadership and commitment 
this commitment is evident not only through the services offered  but also through active participation in causes that contribute to the quality of life  especially in the areas of housing  healthcare  and youth and education 
expanding the markets served through new products and services to serve an expanded audience 
since its formation  awbc has focused primarily on commercial banking to small and medium sized businesses  with limited retail banking services to consumers 
management believes that awbc can continue to gain market share by expanding its retail product offerings for consumers and businesses 
a more complete line of financial products and services will help consumers use money  save money  and manage money  in both their personal and business lives 
providing service to awbc s customers that is based on finding solutions and providing accurate  timely  and intelligent answers 
this service model applies to awbc s service internally as well as service to customers 
the company s overall focus is on offering customers greater value than the larger  regional and national banks 
awbc is more responsive and innovative 
the company s customers and communities trust it for their banking needs because they know awbc as a local provider of banking products and services that is helping them achieve their financial goals 
to increase market share and profitability  awbc places a strong emphasis on moving from a transactional order taking environment to a relationship banking culture where service is based on recommending additional products and services that can benefit a customer  thereby providing better service 
expanding the markets served through de novo branching and acquisitions 
awbc intends to expand its presence in the pacific northwest by opening new branches and possibly acquiring other 
table of contents financial institutions 
management considers a variety of criteria in evaluating potential branch expansion  including the demographics and short and long term growth prospects for the location  the management and other resources needed to integrate the branch into its existing operations  the degree to which the branch would enhance the geographic diversity of awbc or would enhance the presence in an existing market  and the estimated cost of opening and operating the branch as compared to the cost of acquiring an existing office and deposit base 
in addition to internal growth  there may be attractive opportunities to grow awbc through carefully selected acquisitions of other financial institutions or their branches within or adjacent to the company s market area 
the company s ability to make future acquisitions depends on several factors such as the availability of suitable acquisition candidates  necessary regulatory and shareholder approval  and compliance with applicable capital requirements and  in the case of cash acquisitions  on its cash assets or ability to acquire cash 
awbc may need to obtain additional debt and equity capital in pursuing an acquisition strategy 
awbc s access to capital markets or the costs of this capital can be impacted by economic  financial  competitive and other conditions beyond awbc s control 
further  acquisition candidates may not be available in the future on favorable terms 
therefore  no assurance can be made that future acquisitions will occur 
lending activities awbc s loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial loans  commercial real estate loans  agricultural loans  real estate mortgage loans  residential real estate and other construction loans  consumer installment loans and bankcard loans 
at december   awbc had total gross loans outstanding of billion  which equals of awbc s deposits and of its assets 
the majority of the loans held by awbc were to borrowers within the company s principal market areas 
see loan category amounts for five years in item  selected financial data 
commercial loans 
commercial loans primarily consist of loans to businesses for various purposes  including term loans  revolving lines of credit  equipment financing loans and letters of credit 
these loans generally mature within one to five years  have adjustable rates and are secured by inventory  accounts receivable  or equipment  although certain loans are unsecured 
commercial lending has increased risk in comparison to certain other types of lending as a result of dependence on income production for future repayment  and in certain circumstances  the lack of tangible collateral 
commercial loans are underwritten based on the financial strength and repayment ability of the borrower  as well as the value of any collateral securing the loans 
commercial lending operations rely on a strong credit culture that combines prudent credit policies and individual lender accountability 
commercial real estate loans 
commercial real estate loans primarily consist of loans to purchase or construct commercial and multifamily properties 
these loans are secured by real estate  generally mature in five to ten years and can be fixed or adjustable rate 
commercial real estate loans include commercial construction loans 
construction loans may involve additional risks because loan funds are collateralized by the project under construction  which is of uncertain value prior to completion 
delays may arise from labor problems  material shortages may be experienced and other unpredictable contingencies may occur 
it is important to evaluate accurately the total loan funds required to complete a project and related loan to value ratios 
because of these factors  the analysis of prospective construction loan projects requires an expertise that is different in significant respects from the expertise required for commercial real estate lending 
awbc s underwriting criteria are designed to evaluate and minimize the risks of each commercial construction loan 
among other things  awbc considers evidence of the availability of permanent financing for the borrower  the reputation of the borrower  the amount of the borrower s equity in the project  the independent appraisal and review of cost estimates  the pre construction sale and leasing information  and the cash flow projections of the borrower 
agricultural loans 
agricultural loans primarily consist of farm loans to finance operating expenses 
these loans generally mature within one year  have adjustable rates and are secured by farm real estate  equipment  crops or livestock 
since agricultural loans present certain risks not associated with other types of lending  ordinarily the policy of awbc is to make such loans only to agricultural producers with diverse production ability  thereby mitigating the risk of loss attributable to a crop failure or the deterioration of commodity prices

construction loans 
construction loans are made to individuals and contractors to construct primarily single family principal residences 
these loans typically have maturities of twelve months 
interest rates are typically fixed  although some adjustable rate loans are made 
the company s policies normally require that a permanent financing commitment be in place before a construction loan is made to an individual borrower 
construction loans may involve additional risks because loan funds are collateralized by the project under construction  which is of uncertain value prior to completion 
delays may arise from labor problems  material shortages may be experienced and other unpredictable contingencies may occur 
it is important to evaluate accurately the total loan funds required to complete a project and related loan to value ratios 
because of these factors  the analysis of prospective construction loan projects requires an expertise that is different in significant respects from the expertise required for real estate mortgage lending 
construction lending is generally considered to involve a higher degree of collateral risk than long term financing of residential properties 
awbc s risk of loss on a construction loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property s value and marketability at completion of construction or development and the estimated cost including interest of construction 
if the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate  the company may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project 
if the estimate of value upon completion proves to be inaccurate  the company may be confronted at  or prior to  the maturity of the loan with a project whose value is insufficient to assure full repayment 
awbc s underwriting criteria are designed to evaluate and minimize the risks of each real estate construction loan 
among other things  awbc considers evidence of the availability of permanent financing for the borrower  the reputation of the borrower  the amount of the borrower s equity in the project  the independent appraisal and review of cost estimates  the pre construction sale and leasing information  and the cash flow projections of the borrower 
installment and other loans 
installment and other loans are primarily automobile  bankcard and personal loans  otherwise known as consumer loans 
these loans generally have maturities of five years or less  and fixed interest rates 
consumer lending may involve special risks  including decreases in the value of collateral and transaction costs associated with foreclosure and repossession 
interest rates 
the interest rates earned on loans vary with the degree of risk and amount of the loan  and are further subject to competitive pressures  money market rates  the availability of funds and government regulations 
approximately of the loans in the company s portfolio have interest rates that adjust with the lending company s reference rates  which are in turn based on various indices such as the rates of interest charged by money center banks 
lending and credit management 
the company follows loan policies 
the policies establish levels of loan commitment by loan type  credit review and grading criteria  and cover other matters such as loan administration  loans to affiliates  costs  problem loans and loan loss reserves  and related items 
loans are analyzed at origination and on a periodic basis as conditions warrant as outlined in the company s loan policies 
all loan applications are received at awb s branch lending offices and processed centrally through loan processing and administration

accruing loans days or more past due remain on an accrual basis because they are adequately collateralized and in the process of collection 
for nonaccrual loans no interest is taken into income unless received in cash and the borrower demonstrates an ability to resume payments of principal and interest 
interest previously accrued  but not collected is reversed and charged against income at the time a loan is placed in nonaccrual status

the loan is a purchased participation and represents of the total obligation of the borrower 
sale of the property by the trustee has occurred with payoff of the loan expected in the first half of analysis of allowance for loan losses the allowance for credit losses is established to absorb known and inherent losses primarily resulting from loans outstanding 
accordingly  all credit losses are charged to the allowance and all recoveries are credited to it 
the provision for credit losses charged to operating expense is based on past credit loss experience and other factors  which in management s judgment deserve current recognition in estimating probable credit losses 
such other factors include growth and composition of the loan portfolio  credit concentrations  trends in portfolio volume  maturities  delinquencies and non accruals  the relationship of the allowance for credit losses to outstanding loans  historical loss trends and general economic conditions 
while management uses the best information available to base its estimates  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions  particularly in the company s market  differ substantially from the assumptions used 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for credit losses 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
awbc utilizes a loan loss reserve methodology and documentation process which it believes is consistent with sec accounting bulletin no 
 selected loan loss allowance methodology and documentation issues 
additionally  awbc adopted sfas no 
and no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
these accounting pronouncements require specific identification of an allowance for loan loss for an impaired or nonperforming loan 
to this end  awbc developed a systematic methodology using a nine grade scale system to determine its allowance for loan losses 
on at least a quarterly basis the allowance is recalculated to determine if the amount allocated is adequate 
this process is disciplined and consistently applied 
this methodology includes a detailed analysis of the loan portfolio that is performed on a quarterly basis by competent and well trained personnel who have the skills and experience to perform analyses  estimates  reviews and other loan loss methodology function 
all loans are considered in the analysis whether on an individual or group basis  using current and reliable data 
loans are evaluated for impairment on an individual basis  if applicable  and the remainder of the portfolio is segmented into groups of loans with similar risk characteristics 
management considers all relevant internal and external factors that may affect loan collectability  including interest  if applicable 
additionally  the methodology includes consideration of particular risks inherent in different kinds of lending 
current collateral values less costs to sell are considered in cases where this type of analysis is applicable 
the analysis ensures the loan loss allowance balance and methodology is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
at december   the company had approximately million of loans that were not classified as nonperforming but for which known information about the borrower s financial condition caused 
table of contents management to have concern about the ability of the borrowers to comply with the repayment terms of the loans 
these loans were identified through the loan review process described above that provides for assignment of a risk rating based on a nine grade scale 
based on the evaluation of current market conditions  loan collateral  other secondary sources of repayment and cash flow generation  management does not anticipate any significant losses related to these loans 
these loans are subject to continuing management attention and are considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
a decline in the economic conditions in the company s market areas or other factors could adversely impact individual borrowers or the loan portfolio in general 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that other loans will not become days or more past due  be placed on nonaccrual or transferred to foreclosed real estate and other foreclosed assets in the future

table of contents the company s branches located in rural towns in eastern and central washington and northern idaho are in areas with economies that historically have been based on the agricultural  timber  mining industries  education or on tourism 
these locations generally do not provide significant economic growth but tend to be underserved by the financial industry 
competition the company competes primarily with large national and regional banks  as well as credit unions  savings and loans  mortgage companies  and other financial institutions 
management believes there are three key differentiators that distinguish it from its bank competition it is committed to a local  community banking model  its smaller size makes it more adaptable  and it puts customer service first 
management believes that its competitive position has been strengthened by the consolidation of past years in the banking industry  which resulted in many community banks that were previously owned locally becoming part of large national or regional banks 
the company s strategy  by contrast  is to remain closely tied to a community banking model with strong local connections 
employees as of december   the company had full time equivalent employees  none of whom is covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
following the mergers and consolidations in the early part of this decade  management has focused on acculturating employees while acknowledging and respecting the heritage of each bank and how it has shaped who the company is today 
all employees now operate under a unified organization  which management believes has been a positive transition 
renewed focus on employee training programs  on internal marketing and communication systems  and on consistent and equitable salary structures will further improve employee relations  which management believes are currently good

awbc does not believe that the act negatively affects the operations of it or its subsidiaries 
however  to the extent the legislation permits banks  securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate  the financial

extensions of credit i must be made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not covered above and who are not employees  and ii must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons 
a violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties on the affected bank or any officer  director  employee  agent  or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of that bank  the imposition of a cease and desist order  and other regulatory sanctions 
federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act 
under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  each federal banking agency has prescribed  by regulation  non capital safety and soundness standards for institutions under its authority 
these standards cover internal controls  information systems  and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  compensation  fees and benefits  such other operational and managerial standards as the agency determines to be appropriate  and standards for asset quality  earnings and stock valuation 
an institution which fails to meet these standards must develop a plan acceptable to the agency  specifying the steps that the institution will take to meet the standards 
failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions 
management of awbc believes that its subsidiary bank meets all such standards  and therefore  does not believe that these regulatory standards materially affect awbc s business operations 
interstate banking and branching 
the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of interstate act permits nationwide interstate banking and branching under certain circumstances 
this legislation generally authorizes interstate branching and relaxes federal law restrictions on interstate banking 
currently  bank holding companies may purchase banks in any state  and states may not prohibit such purchases 
additionally  banks are permitted to merge with banks in other states as long as the home state of neither merging bank has opted out 
the interstate act requires regulators to consult with community organizations before permitting an interstate institution to close a branch in a low income area 
under recent fdic regulations  banks are prohibited from using their interstate branches primarily for deposit production 
the fdic has accordingly implemented a loan to deposit ratio screen to ensure compliance with this prohibition 

table of contents with regard to interstate bank mergers  washington has opted in to the interstate act and allows in state banks to merge with out of state banks subject to certain aging requirements 
washington law generally authorizes the acquisition of an in state bank by an out of state bank through merger with a washington financial institution that has been in existence for at least years prior to the acquisition 
with regard to interstate bank branching  out of state banks that do not already operate a branch in washington may not establish de novo branches in washington or establish and operate a branch by acquiring a branch in washington 
deposit insurance 
the deposits of awbc s subsidiary bank are currently insured to a maximum of  per depositor through the bank insurance fund bif administered by the fdic 
all insured banks are required to pay semi annual deposit insurance premium assessments to the fdic 
fdicia included provisions to reform the federal deposit insurance system  including the implementation of risk based deposit insurance premiums 
fdicia also permits the fdic to make special assessments on insured depository institutions in amounts determined by the fdic to be necessary to give it adequate assessment income to repay amounts borrowed from the us treasury and other sources  or for any other purpose the fdic deems necessary 
the fdic has implemented a risk based insurance premium system under which banks are assessed insurance premiums based on how much risk they present to the bif 
banks with higher levels of capital and a low degree of supervisory concern are assessed lower premiums than banks with lower levels of capital or a higher degree of supervisory concern 
dividends 
the principal source of awbc s cash revenues is dividends received from its subsidiary bank 
the payment of dividends is subject to government regulation  in that regulatory authorities may prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying dividends which would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
in addition  a bank may not pay cash dividends if that payment could reduce the amount of its capital below that necessary to meet minimum applicable regulatory capital requirements 
capital adequacy 
federal bank regulatory agencies use capital adequacy guidelines in the examination and regulation of bank holding companies and banks 
if capital falls below minimum guideline levels  the holding company or bank may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non bank businesses or to open new facilities 
the fdic and federal reserve use risk based capital guidelines for banks and bank holding companies 
these are designed to make such capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies  to account for off balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories  each with appropriate weights 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
the guidelines are minimums  and the federal reserve has noted that bank holding companies contemplating significant expansion programs should not allow expansion to diminish their capital ratios and should maintain ratios well in excess of the minimum 
the current guidelines require all bank holding companies and federally regulated banks to maintain a minimum risk based total capital ratio equal to  of which at least must be tier i capital 
tier i capital for bank holding companies includes common shareholders equity  certain qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less intangibles 
the company s regulatory capital ratios are reported in note regulatory matters 
the federal reserve also employs a leverage ratio  which is tier i capital as a percentage of total assets less intangibles  to be used as a supplement to risk based guidelines 
the principal objective of the leverage ratio is to constrain the maximum degree to which a bank holding company may leverage its equity capital base 
the federal reserve requires a minimum leverage ratio of 
however  for all but the most highly rated bank holding companies and for bank holding companies seeking to expand  the federal reserve expects an additional amount of capital at least to 

table of contents fdicia created a statutory framework of supervisory actions indexed to the capital level of the individual institution 
under regulations adopted by the fdic  an institution is assigned to one of five capital categories depending on its total risk based capital ratio  tier i risk based capital ratio  and leverage ratio  together with certain subjective factors 
institutions which are deemed to be undercapitalized depending on the category to which they are assigned are subject to certain mandatory supervisory corrective actions 
awbc does not believe that these regulations have any material effect on its operations 
effects of government monetary policy 
the earnings and growth of awbc are affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government  particularly the federal reserve 
the federal reserve can and does implement national monetary policy for such purposes as curbing inflation and combating recession  but its open market operations in us government securities  control of the discount rate applicable to borrowings from the federal reserve  and establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits  influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits  and also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits 
the nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on awbc and its subsidiary bank cannot be predicted with certainty 
disclosure controls and procedures the sarbanes oxley act of and related rulemaking by the securities and exchange commission sec  which effect sweeping corporate disclosure and financial reporting reform  generally require public companies to focus on their disclosure controls and procedures 
as a result  public companies such as americanwest bancorporation  now must have disclosure controls and procedures in place and make certain disclosures about them in their periodic sec reports ie  forms k and q and their chief executive and chief financial officers must certify in these filings that they are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures and disclose their conclusions about the effectiveness of such controls and procedures based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by the relevant report  among other things 
awbc is monitoring the status of other related ongoing rulemaking by the sec and other regulatory entities 
currently  management believes that awbc is in compliance with the rulemaking promulgated to date 
customer information security the fdic and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted final guidelines for establishing standards for safeguarding nonpublic personal information about customers that implement provisions of the financial modernization act of guidelines 
among other things  the guidelines require each financial institution  under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof  to develop  implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information  to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information  and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer 
management believes the company is currently in compliance with the final guidelines 
privacy the fdic and other regulatory agencies have published final privacy rules pursuant to provisions of the financial modernization act of privacy rules 
the privacy rules  which govern the treatment of nonpublic personal information about consumers by financial institutions  require a financial institution to provide notice to customers and other consumers in some circumstances about its privacy policies and practices  describe the conditions under which a financial institution may disclose nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties and provide a method for consumers to prevent a financial institution from disclosing that information to most nonaffiliated third parties by opting out of that disclosure  subject to certain exceptions 
management believes the company is currently in compliance with the final guidelines

awbc completed its merger with latah bancorporation  inc and bank of latah bol effective july  as of july   bol had approximately million in total assets  million in deposits  and million in loans 
approximately  awbc shares and million in cash were issued to bol shareholders for the merger 
the purchase accounting method was used for the transaction 
on march   awb and bol consolidated and currently operate as awb 
awbc derives income primarily from the difference between the interest income it earns on loans and investments and the interest expense it pays on customer s deposits and the company s borrowings  commonly known as net interest income 
this is supplemented by non interest income the company earns 
primarily  the non interest income is derived from service fees related to deposits and services provided by awbc  increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance and gains on sales of assets 
net interest income is offset by provision for loan losses related to risks and charges associated with its loan portfolio and operating expenses  including compensation  facilities related expenses  data processing and other expenses 
other expenses may include business and occupation taxes  losses on sales of assets and costs related to foreclosed real estate and other foreclosed assets 
in late and  the company undertook a series of initiatives to enhance and strengthen its credit administration 
such steps began during the latter part of whereby a new chief credit officer was hired 
this was followed by a review of the company s credit activities through third party loan reviews and administering more uniform credit criteria 
as a result of these steps  the company believes that going forward the quality of its underwriting policies and loan portfolio will improve 
however  many factors including general economic conditions  financial performance of the company s customers and general market conditions will affect the performance of the loan portfolio 
during this period  the company increased its provision for loan losses to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the prior year

provision for loan losses increased to million in from million in and million in in  the company took two additional provisions  one in may and one in december 
the may provision and subsequent charge off of million was related to a single borrowing relationship with a company that had provided telecommunications and electricity transmission infrastructure 
the december provision of million was related to deterioration of several large loans and a general loan portfolio review 
credit authorities assigned to individual loan officers prior to were high  with several lenders having authority to approve loans over million without secondary review 
this practice led to a lack of 
table of contents uniformity in the evaluation of credit risk  and some previously unidentified credit risk in the loan portfolio 
this is reflected in the level of provision for loan losses during the years through  especially the company  as part of its efforts to strengthen its credit administration  appointed a new chief credit officer in late  with enhanced credit administration activities 
the company implemented a third party loan review  reduced lending levels  centralized documentation  credit administration and loan processing and revised its lending policy in additionally  the company created a special assets group in to enable increased expediency in dealing with classified assets including nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate and other foreclosed assets 
provisions are made to reserve for known and inherent risk characteristics within the loan portfolio 
awbc regularly evaluates the level of provision and the allowance for loan losses for adequacy by considering such factors as current loan grades  historical loss rates  change in the nature of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  industry concentrations  delinquency trends  current economic factors and estimated impact of current economic conditions that may affect a borrower s ability to pay 
the provision for loan losses is an estimate and the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provision for loan losses 
if negative trends and expectations of management do not materialize  the allowance may be high relative to the actual performance of the asset portfolio 
this would lead to future provisions being less than the current provision 
likewise  if positive trends and expectations of management fail to come to fruition  the provision for loan losses in the current period may be inadequate and future provisions may be larger 
in addition  the allowance for loan losses and the provision for loan losses is subject to regulatory supervision and examination 
noninterest income 
noninterest income  which consists of fees and service charges  increases in the cash value of bank owned life insurance  asset sales gains and losses and other income  increased in to million 
the company sold its ione  washington branch and million in related deposits 
this resulted in a million gain on the sale 
additionally  the company recognized million in gains on sale of foreclosed real estate and other foreclosed assets and other assets 
the company recognized  absent the above noted gains  an increase in noninterest income of in compared to the increase was due to increases in fees and service charges and an increase in the income recognized for the increase in the cash value of bank owned life insurance in the other income line item 
fees and service charges for services increased to million in after being at million in and million in noninterest expense 
noninterest expense increased by in compared to salaries and employee benefits increased in compared to this increase reflects increases in health care costs and increases in compensation related to staff count and to increased compensation levels 
facilities related expenses  shown as occupancy and equipment expense  increased in due to new facilities being placed into service in  increased utility and maintenance costs 
in  costs related to foreclosed real estate and other foreclosed assets increased million mostly due to asset write downs  million of which occurred in the th quarter 
additionally  other expense increased in compared to due to increases in items such as accounting fees related to sarbanes oxley compliance  supplies expense  and marketing expense 
these costs were offset by a reduction in legal fees of million 
the majority of decrease in legal fees in was due to reduced litigation related to foreclosed real estate and other foreclosed assets 
provision for income tax 
provision for income tax for the year ended december  decreased as a percentage of income before income taxes to compared to for the year ended december  the reduction in the effective tax rate is due to the effect of rehabilitation tax credits recognized during  the effect of the level of permanent tax differences in relation to total taxable 
table of contents income  and the effect of the expected surrender of bank owned life insurance policies due to the policies decreased performance and increased carrier credit risks 
the surrender of such policies requires the payment of income tax based on the increase in the cash surrender value of the policy 
liquidity and capital resources management believes that awbc s cash flow will be sufficient to support its existing operations for the foreseeable future 
cash flows from operations contribute significantly to liquidity  as do proceeds from maturities of securities and increasing customer deposits 
in  awbc generated million of net cash flows from its operating activities and million in additionally  the company generated million and million in net cash from financing activities in and  respectively 
awb has the ability to borrow on a short term basis from various sources  including the federal home loan bank and correspondent banks 
at december   awb had approximately million available and million of available lines at december  additionally  awb can borrow for long term needs from the federal home loan bank 
awbc s ability to incur indebtedness is limited by government regulations and its ability to service borrowings is dependent upon the availability of dividends from awb 
the payments of dividends by awb to awbc are subject to limitations imposed by law and governmental regulations 
in determining whether awb s board of directors will declare a dividend  awb s board will consider factors including applicable laws and regulatory requirements  awb s financial condition  anticipated growth  and regulatory capital requirements 
awbc s total stockholders equity increased to million at december   from million at december  and million at december  at december  stockholders equity was of total assets  compared to at december  at december   awbc held cash and cash equivalent assets of million 
the capital levels of awbc and the bank exceed applicable regulatory well capitalized guidelines at december   and december  regulatory capital ratios can be reviewed in note  regulatory matters 
effects of inflation and changing prices 
the primary impact of inflation on awbc s operations is increased asset yields  deposit costs and operating overhead 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
the effects of inflation can magnify the growth of assets  and if significant  would require that equity capital increase at a faster rate than would otherwise be necessary

 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
this statement will be adopted on july  the company plans to use the modified retrospective method  restating the prior interim periods of as permitted by statement  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption

it defined a vie as a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for the business purpose that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
this interpretation required a vie to be consolidated or deconsolidated by a company generally based on the risk of loss or return

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management considers interest rate risk to be a market risk that could have a significant effect on the financial condition and results of operations of awbc 
awbc does not use derivatives including forward and futures contracts  options  and swaps to manage its market and interest rate risks 
all of awbc s transactions are denominated in us dollars 
approximately of awbc s loan portfolio has interest rates which adjust with the bank s reference interest rates 
fixed rate loans are generally made with a term of five years or less 
general economic conditions  regulatory policy and competition in the marketplace affect interest income and cost of funds 
the company s operating strategies focus on asset liability management 
the purpose of asset liability management alm is to provide stable net interest income growth by protecting the awbc s earnings from undue interest rate risk 
awbc follows an alm policy for managing exposure to interest rate risk 
the alm policy is designed to maintain an appropriate balance between rate sensitive assets and liabilities in order to maximize interest rate spreads 
awbc monitors the sensitivity of its assets and liabilities with respect to changes in interest rates and maturities and directs the allocation of their funds accordingly 
the strategy of awbc has been to maintain  to the extent possible  a balanced position between assets and liabilities and to place emphasis on the sensitivity of its assets 
management utilizes an interest rate simulation model to estimate the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
such estimates are based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario  including the level of balance sheet growth  deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of awbc s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest bearing assets and liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement  repricing or maturity during the life of the instruments 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during periods of changes in market interest rates 
effective interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities respond to changes in interest rates within an acceptable timeframe  thereby minimizing the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 

table of contents the following table presents estimated maturity information indicating awbc s exposure to interest rate changes as of december  the expected maturities take into consideration historical and estimated principal prepayments for loans and securities 
principal prepayments are the amounts of principal reduction in addition to contractual amortization 
fixed rate and variable rate loans are expected to have payment rates of    and for the following five years  respectively

awbc uses budgeting and earnings projections to forecast earnings 
it requires assumptions about the projection of loan and securities prepayments  loan originations and liability funding sources  which may prove to be inaccurate 
awbc utilizes an interest rate simulation model to monitor and evaluate the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income 
the time horizon that is used for the simulation is one year and reflects changes in net interest income if interest rates move in a certain way 
the table below reflects the change in net interest income if rates move up basis points or down basis points ratably over a year period 
included in the analysis are assumptions regarding prepayment of loans  withdrawals of deposits  balance sheet activities and economic conditions 
scenario percentage change in net interest income rates increase basis points ratably over months rates decrease basis points ratably over months based on the simulation model  net income is expected to increase slightly when rates increase and shrink somewhat when rates fall 
this is because of the concentration of adjustable rate and short term loans in awbc s portfolio 
however  there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates will not have a material adverse impact on awbc 

table of contents the preceding interest rate sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast by awbc and should not be relied on as being indicative of future operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based on numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  repayments on loans and securities  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment and replacement of asset and liability cash flows and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurance as to the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment and refinancing levels deviating from those assumed  the varying impact on adjustable rate assets of interest rate change caps and floors  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal and external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that the alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
