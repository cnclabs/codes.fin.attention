for more details on the rfc acquisition  see note acquisition of banking center offices in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
effective april   first defiance sold its leader mortgage subsidiary to us bank home mortgage  a unit of us bank  and recognized an after tax gain of million  or per share from the sale 
that gain  as well as all operating results associated with the leader  has been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
during the third quarter of  first defiance settled all remaining contingent liabilities related to its sale of leader mortgage and recorded a million pre tax charge in continuing operations 
financial condition total assets at december  were billion compared to billion at december  net loans receivable increased by million or to million at december  from million at december  a portion of that loan growth was funded with assets from the company s investment securities portfolio  which dropped from million at december  to million at december  a portion of loan growth was also funded by a decline in cash balances and interest bearing deposits at other financial institutions  which declined to million at december  from million at the same date in the company also redeemed million of stock at the federal home loan bank during the year and that balance declined to million at december  from million at december  after also accounting for quarterly fhlb stock dividends 
goodwill and intangibles  which increased substantially during because of the rfc acquisition  declined to million at december  from million at december  because of a revision in the purchase price allocation recorded by management 
the increase in loans receivable occurred in virtually all major loan categories 
non residential real estate loans increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  home equity and improvement loans increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  owner occupied residential loans increased by million  or to million at december  from million at december  commercial loan balances increased by million  or to million at december  from million at december  consumer finance loans increased by million  or to million at december  from million at december  the decline in the company s investment portfolio is due to management taking advantage of the rate environment by selling investments and realizing gains during of million 
further  with the strong loan growth the company experienced  many securities that matured were used to fund that growth rather than reinvested in the securities portfolio 
the remaining million portfolio has an average duration of years 
the company s total deposits increased to million at december  from million at december   an increase of 
key to the deposit growth is growth in checking accounts  which increased to million at december  from million at the end of  an increase of and an increase in money market demand account balances  which increased to million at december  from million at december   an increase of 
because the balance in that type of transaction accounts can fluctuate significantly  management typically assesses growth by reviewing average balances rather than period end balances 
the average balance in checking accounts increased to million for the full year in compared to million for  an improvement of 
the checking average balance includes million of non interest bearing deposits for  up from million in certificate of deposit balances increased to million at december  from million at december   an increase of million or just 
of that growth  million was due to an increase in the average balance of brokered certificates of deposit used by the company to supplement its funding needs 
in addition to deposit growth  first defiance had an increase in its fhlb advance balances  which increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase in advances  which were all short term overnight advances  was used to fund the loan growth 
average balances  interest rates and yields the following table presents for the periods indicated the total dollar amounts of interest from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates  and the net interest margin

in order to compare the tax exempt yields on these assets to taxable yields  the interest earned on these assets is adjusted to a pre tax equivalent amount based on the marginal corporate federal income tax rate of 
at december   the yields earned and rates paid were as follows loans receivable   securities   fhlb stock   total interest earning assets   deposits   fhlb advances   other borrowings   total interest bearing liabilities   and interest rate spread  
interest rate spread is the difference in the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
rate volume analysis the following table describes the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest related assets and liabilities have affected first defiance s interest income and expense during the periods indicated 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to i changes in volume change in volume multiplied by prior year rate  ii change in rate change in rate multiplied by prior year volume  and iii total change in rate and volume 
the combined effect of changes in both rate and volume has been allocated proportionately to the change due to rate and the change due to volume

results for included million of discontinued operations related to the operating results of and gain on sale from the company s former leader mortgage company subsidiary  which was sold to us bancorp on april  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
income from continuing operations was million for the year ended december  excluding the cumulative effect adjustment for a change in accounting for goodwill  first defiance had income from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  on a diluted per share basis  first defiance earned in  in and in diluted per share income from continuing operations was in 
before cumulative effect adjustment for change in accounting for goodwill 
the operating results included a million pretax charge to reflect final settlement of certain contingent liabilities related to the sale of leader mortgage to us bancorp 
after tax  that amount was million or per diluted share 
net interest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
the tax equivalent net interest margin was  and for the years ended december   and respectively 
the increase in margin between and is due to an improved interest rate spread  which increased from in to in  a result primarily due to a basis point reduction in the company s overall cost of interest bearing liabilities from to compared to a drop of just six basis points on the yield of interest earning assets from in to in 
margin also improved due to an million increase in the average balance in non interest bearing deposits and a million increase in capital 
the increase in the margin between and is due to an improved interest rate spread  which increased from in to in  a result the cost of interest bearing liabilities dropping basis points compared to the yield on interest earning assets  which fell by just basis points 
the margin between and also improved because of growth in non interest bearing deposits between the two periods 
the decline in asset yields in compared to is the result of a basis point decline in the yield on loans  which dropped to in from in that decline was partially offset by an improved asset mix as average loan balances increased from million in to million in while the average balance in securities declined from million in to million in and the average balance of interest bearing deposits declined from million in to just million in the basis point decline in the yield on interest earning assets between and was due to an basis point decline in the yield on the company s loan portfolio from in to in the drop in loan yields was slightly offset by an improved mix of loans  securities and interest earning deposits in compared to the overall decline in rates for both assets and liabilities in compared to was due to the low rate environment that existed throughout the entire twelve month period in  the result of cuts by the federal reserve to its federal funds rate during that year 
the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  was million compared to million in and million in for the year ended december   non interest income was million compared to million for and million for non interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for and million for if you exclude the contingency settlement from non interest expense  it totaled million 
net interest income first defiance s net interest income is determined by its interest rate spread ie the difference between the yields on its interest earning assets and the rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
total interest income increased by million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in income was due to an increase in the average balance of loans receivable  to million for the twelve months of compared to million for during the same period  the average balance of lower yielding investment securities declined to million in from million in and funds held on deposit at other financial institutions dropped to an average of just million in from million in while loan yields between and dropped to from  that basis point decline was more than offset by the change in the mix between loans and lower yielding assets 
the increase in the average balance of loans receivable was due primarily to the growth in the company s commercial real estate loans  which increased by million or between december  and december  in addition  balances in one to four family residential real estate loans  commercial loans and home equity loans increased by million  million and million respectively from the beginning to the end of interest income from the investment portfolio decreased to million for from million in the decrease is due to a decline in the average balance from million for to million for as securities were sold or matured  the proceeds were generally utilized to fund loan growth 
the yield on the investment portfolio  on a tax equivalent basis to reflect the favorable tax treatment of tax exempt municipal securities  was for both and first defiance also substantially improved its asset mix as interest bearing deposits  which averaged million for and were million at december   declined to minimal amounts in the average balance of those deposits were just million in yields on those interest bearing deposits were just in and in total interest income increased by million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was a result of growth in non owner occupied residential mortgage loans and commercial loans which increased by million  or in  to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase in these portfolios is the result of first defiance s june acquisition of branches in findlay  ottawa and mccomb  ohio from rfc banking company 
the growth was also a result of continued strong growth in this type of lending throughout first defiance s market area 
the company also had an increase in the average balance of home equity and improvement loans between and as those balances averaged million in  up from s average balance of million 
income from loans increased to million in compared to million in the growth in balances offset declining yields in first defiance s loan yield declined to in from in income from first defiance s investment portfolio was essentially flat between and as it declined slightly to million for from million for the tax equivalent yield on the portfolio dropped from to between and while the average balance increased from million to million 
first defiance also had a significant decline in the balance of interest earning deposits maintained at other banks  which averaged million during  a drop from the million average balance carried during those deposits were used to fund loan growth and national cd run off 
the yield on those interest bearing deposits  which is closely tied to the federal funds rate  declined to for compared to in interest expense declined by  in from  to million from million 
this decline was the result of a decline in interest rates paid on deposits and the utilization of overnight federal home loan bank advances to help short term funding needs 
interest expense on interest bearing deposits was million for compared to million for despite the fact that the average balance of interest bearing deposits increased to million for from million for the growth in the average balance of deposits occurred in both transaction accounts savings accounts  money market accounts  and interest bearing checking accounts which increased in total to million at december  from million at december  and in certificates of deposits which increased to million at december  from million at december  
the growth in certificate of deposit balances included million of net growth in cds acquired through brokers or on the national market during from a cost perspective  the average cost of interest bearing deposits was in  down from in interest bearing checking accounts cost on average in compared to in  money market accounts had an average rate of in and in  respectively  and cds had an average rate of and in and respectively 
the average cost of fhlb advances declined to in from in because of an increase in the average balance of over night or short term advances during the year 
at december   fhlb advances included million of overnight advances  compared to just million at december  the average balance of short term advances was million for compared to million for there was no change in the balance or rates paid on long term advances during in  interest expense decreased by million  or  to million compared to million in interest expense on interest bearing deposits was million lower in compared to despite an million increase in the average balance of such deposits 
the average cost of interest bearing deposits dropped to in from in the drop in the interest rates paid on deposits occurred in both core deposit accounts  which include money market accounts and interest bearing checking accounts  and in certificates of deposit 
the average cost of savings and interest bearing checking accounts dropped from in to in while the average cost of cds declined from to between the same time periods 
the decline in interest expense on deposits was partially offset by an increase in expense on fhlb advances  which increased to million in from million in part of the increase is due to the fact that the interest expense on approximately million of fhlb advances was allocated to discontinued operations during the first quarter of as those advances were used to fund operations of the leader 
at the completion of the sale of leader  million of those advances were prepaid and the remaining advances were maintained to fund operations of first federal 
as a result of the foregoing  first defiance s net interest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  net interest margin from continuing operations calculated on a tax equivalent basis was for compared to in and in in addition to the factors cited above  net interest margin is also favorably impacted by an increase in non interest bearing deposits  which increased to an average balance of million in from an average of million in and million in provision for loan losses first defiance s provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
provisions for loan losses are charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio 
factors considered by management include identifiable risk in the portfolios  historical experience  the volume and type of lending conducted by first defiance  the amount of non performing assets  including loans which meet the fasb statement no 
definition of impaired  the amount of assets graded by management as substandard  doubtful  or loss  general economic conditions  particularly as they relate to first defiance s market areas  and other factors related to the collectability of first defiance s loan portfolio 
in determining the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses  first defiance evaluates all loans in its portfolio 
while allowances are generally required for loans classified as substandard or lower  it is possible for a credit relationship to be graded as substandard based on the financial performance of the credit for which no allowance is required because of other factors such as value of collateral or creditworthiness of guarantors 
at december   a total of million of loans are classified as substandard for which some level of reserve ranging up to of the outstanding balance is required 
a total of million in additional credits were classified as substandard at december  for which no reserve is required 
first defiance also has classified  as doubtful and  as loss at december  first defiance also utilizes a general reserve percentage for loans not otherwise classified which ranges from for mortgage loans to for consumer loans 
general reserves for commercial and commercial real estate loans  the largest category in first defiance s portfolio  are established at of the outstanding balance 
the reserve percentage utilized for these loans is based on both historical losses in the company s portfolio  national statistics on loss percentages  regulatory guidance and empirical evidence regarding the strength of the economy in first defiance s general market area 
favorable trends in charge offs related to the first defiance portfolio  as well as a strengthening local economy  resulted in a lower level of the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of the total portfolio  as well as a decrease in provision expense in compared to despite strong loan growth during the allowance for loan losses totaled million of loans at december  compared to million of loans at december  and million at december  the allowance for loan losses grew by from december  to december  during that same period  loan balances before the allowance increased by 
total loan charge offs were  in compared to  and  in and respectively while recoveries in those same years were   and  respectively 
as a percentage of average loans  net charge offs were for the year ended december  compared to and for and respectively 
management does not believe there has been any deterioration in the overall quality of its loan portfolio during the percentage of the allowance for loan losses to total loans declined in as a result of the continued significant growth in first defiance s loan portfolio during and the limited amount of provision expense that was required  given the anticipated losses in that portfolio 
the lower level of provision expense results from a number of factors including a strengthening of the local economy in which first defiance conducts its lending business and continued favorable charge off experience  especially in the commercial loan and non residential real estate loan portfolios 
first defiance s non performing assets at december  were just million compared to million at december  and million at december  non performing assets include loans that are days past due and all real estate owned and other foreclosed assets 
non performing assets at december  and by category were as follows december in thousands non performing loans single family residential non residential and multi family residential real estate   commercial consumer finance total non performing loans   real estate owned and repossessed assets total non performing assets   non performing loans in the single family residential  non residential and multi family residential real estate and commercial loan categories represent  and of the total loans in those categories respectively at december  compared to  and respectively for the same categories at december  management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover any potential losses from non performing assets 
non interest income non interest income decreased by million to million for the year ended december  from million in non interest income was million in the reduction between and was due to a gains from the sale of loans declining by million  to million for the year ended december  from million for mortgage gains were million in the fluctuation in mortgage loan gains can be attributed to the significant increase in mortgage origination volume from mid through the third quarter of mortgage origination volume dropped to million of mortgage loans originated in from a peak of million in and million in first defiance also realized million of securities gains in  million in similar gains during and just  of such gains in the increased level of gains realized resulted from management taking advantage of favorable prices on the bond portfolio as long term interest rates stayed low 
generally as investments were sold out of the investment portfolio  the related proceeds were used to fund loan growth or they were reinvested in shorter term securities in order to position the company for an eventual overall rate increase 
loan and deposit fees at first defiance increased to million in from million in and million in  an increase of and respectively year over year 
also  insurance and investment sales commissions recognized in were million compared to million in and million in  an increase of and period to period respectively 
first defiance also had an increase in income associated with its investment in bank owned life insurance boli  which was  in   in and  in income from boli increased because of additional investments made in the product in mid the initial boli purchase was made in the fourth quarter of non interest expense total non interest expense for was million compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the results include a charge of million related to the final settlement of a contingent liability related to first defiance s sale of leader 
non interest expense  excluding the settlement of that contingency  was million for compensation and benefits increased by million or between and that increase was due to the recognition of a full year of expense at branches acquired during june  compared with just six months of expense in compensation and benefits also increased as a result of the opening of de novo branches in findlay and maumee  ohio in late and early respectively  as well as routine compensation adjustments  which were in the range for over  and health insurance increases  which on a per person basis increased by in compared with for  the average number of employees covered under the first defiance group health plan was compared with employees participating in the plan on average for those increases were slightly offset by lower incentive compensation payouts in compared to due to the company s lower level of profitability 
amortization of mortgage servicing rights decreased significantly in compared with  to  from million 
this decrease was due to the lower level of mortgage refinance activity in compared with the results also included  in recoveries of previously recognized mortgage servicing rights impairment reserves 
in  mortgage servicing rights impairment and recovery amounts essentially offset each other over the course of the year 
first defiance services a growing portfolio of mortgage loans for others  comprised of loans originated in its banking offices which are subsequently sold in the secondary market 
at december   first defiance serviced a total of  loans for others with a principal balance of million 
the total servicing portfolio at december  was  loans with balances of million 
the mortgage servicing rights associated with those loans had a net value of million as of december  after subtracting a  reserve for impairment  compared to million as of december  after subtracting  of impairment 
the increase in non interest expense from to was primarily in compensation and benefits which increased by million 
amortization of mortgage servicing rights and data processing costs also increased by  and  respectively from to those increases were partially offset by changes in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights  which resulted in a  recovery of msr impairment in compared with impairment expense of  in income taxes income taxes amounted to million in compared to million in and million of income taxes from continuing operations in the effective tax rates for those years were  and respectively 
the tax rate is lower than the statutory tax rate for the company because of investments in tax exempt securities and in boli 
the earnings on such investments are not subject to federal income tax 
discontinued operations first defiance s results included income from discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share 
the amount included million related to the after tax gain on the sale of the leader  million of income earned by leader during the three months the subsidiary was operated by first defiance  and  of other expenses associated with discontinued operations 
interest expense recorded at first federal which was associated solely with financing activities of the leader  primarily interest on brokered cds and a portion of the company s fhlb advances  was reported as part of discontinued operations 
change in accounting for goodwill effective january   first defiance adopted fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as required under the standard  management evaluated goodwill recorded at its first insurance investments subsidiary for the purpose of measuring impairment and determined that such goodwill was impaired by   or per share after tax as of january  as required  that amount was reflected in the income statement as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
as a result of statement no 
 first defiance is no longer required to recognize goodwill amortization as an expense 
management is required to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis to determine if the recorded value is impaired 
during  first defiance paid additional consideration of  to settle a contingent payout clause under an agreement entered into in when first insurance was acquired 
because the settlement was reached after january   the goodwill created by the settlement was deemed to be impaired in and was recorded as part of non interest expense in goodwill was evaluated at the end of  and and no additional impairment charges were required for any of those periods 
see footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
concentrations of credit risk financial institutions such as first defiance generate income primarily through lending and investing activities 
the risk of loss from lending and investing activities includes the possibility that losses may occur from the failure of another party to perform according to the terms of the loan or investment agreement 
this possibility is known as credit risk 
lending or investing activities that concentrate assets in a way that exposes the company to a material loss from any single occurrence or group of occurrences increases credit risk 
diversifying loans and investments to prevent concentrations of risks is one manner a financial institution can reduce potential losses due to credit risk 
examples of asset concentrations would include multiple loans made to a single borrower and loans of inappropriate size relative to the total capitalization of the institution 
management believes adherence to its loan and investment policies allows it to control its exposure to concentrations of credit risk at acceptable levels 
first defiance s loan portfolio is concentrated geographically in its northwest ohio market area 
there are no industry concentrations that exceed of the company s loan portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity is its core deposit base  raised through first federal s branch network  along with unused wholesale sources of funding and its capital base 
these funds  along with investment securities  provide the ability to meet the needs of depositors while funding new loan demand and existing commitments 
cash generated from operating activities was million and million in and respectively and cash used in operating activities was million in excluding the gain from the sale of discontinued operations and net changes in assets and liabilities of discontinued operations  first defiance used million of cash in operations in the adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by or used in operations during the periods presented consist primarily of proceeds from the sale of loans less the origination of loans held for sale  the provision for loan losses  depreciation expense  the origination  amortization and impairment of mortgage servicing rights  esop expense related to the release of esop shares in accordance with aicpa sop and increases and decreases in other assets and liabilities 
in a typical year  the primary investing activity of first defiance is lending  which is funded with cash provided from operating and financing activities  as well as proceeds from payment on existing loans and proceeds from maturities of investment securities 
in addition to the ordinary investing activities  in  first defiance completed the rfc acquisition  which increased cash from investing activities by million as deposits acquired exceeded the purchase price plus loans acquired 
in  first defiance realized proceeds from the sale of the leader of million 
in considering the more typical investing activities  during  million and million was generated from the maturity or sale of available for sale investment securities  respectively  while million was used fund loan growth while million was used to purchase available for sale investment securities 
during  million and million was realized from the maturity of investment securities and sale of investment securities respectively while million was used to fund loan growth and million was used to purchase available for sale securities 
during  a total of million was used to purchase available for sale securities  million in proceeds were received from the maturing of available for sale securities and million was used to fund loan growth 
principal financing activities include the gathering of deposits  the utilization of fhlb advances  the sale of securities under agreements to repurchase such securities and borrowings from other banks 
in addition  first defiance also purchased common stock for its treasury 
for the year ended december   deposits increased by million  including million of growth in retail deposits generated by the first federal bank branch network  and million in net growth in deposits acquired from cd brokers or other out of market sources 
for the year ended december   deposits declined by million  primarily do to the company not replacing million of maturing brokered certificates of deposit which were no longer needed 
first defiance also had a million decline in deposits in due to the maturing of million of brokered cds 
also in  first defiance borrowed million in short term advances from the fhlb and million on from other financial institutions under short term lines of credit 
in  first defiance borrowed million from the fhlb under long term advance agreements and an additional million was borrowed on short term advances 
in  the company repaid million of existing advances from the fhlb  borrowed million of new advances from the fhlb and repaid million of borrowings from other banks 
also  the company repurchased million  million and million of common stock for treasury in  and respectively 
for additional information about cash flows from first defiance s operating  investing and financing activities  see the consolidated statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements 
at december   first defiance had the following commitments to fund deposit  advance and borrowing obligations maturity dates by period at december  less than after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands savings  checking and demand accounts   certificates of deposit      fhlb overnight advances   fhlb fixed advances including interest      securities sold under repurchase agreements   lease obligations   total contractual cash obligations      includes principal payments of  and interest payments of  at december   first defiance had the following commitments to fund loan or line of credit obligations amount of commitment expiration by period total amounts less than after commitments committed year years years years in thousands mortgage loans in process   commercial loans in process      single family mortgage loan originations   nonmortgage loan originations   consumer lines of credit      commercial lines of credit    total commitments      in addition to the above commitments  at december  first defiance had commitments to sell million of loans held for sale to freddie mac 
to meet its obligations  management can adjust the rate of savings certificates to retain deposits in changing interest rate environments  it can sell or securitize mortgage and non mortgage loans  and it can turn to other sources of financing including fhlb advances  the federal reserve bank  bank lines and brokered certificates of deposit

at december   first federal had capital ratios that exceeded the standard to be considered well capitalized 
for additional information about first federal s capital requirements  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
pro forma income statement management does not believe that the reported income from continuing operations for the year ended december  accurately represented the true financial picture of first defiance because continuing operations for the first three months of did not reflect the reinvestment of any of the net proceeds realized from the sale of the leader 
the following pro forma income statement attempts to present what first defiance s results from continuing operations would have been for had the sale of the leader occurred as of january  and the proceeds invested for the period from january  to april  management has estimated that additional assets added to the balance sheet as a result of the sale would have been reinvested to yield a weighted average rate of for the first quarter of also  to the extent possible  management has assumed that proceeds from the sale were used to prepay advances

income tax on  increase in net interest income at critical accounting policies first defiance has established various accounting policies which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation of its financial statements 
the significant accounting policies of first defiance are described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management  which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of first defiance 
allowance for loan losses first defiance believes the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
in determining the appropriate estimate for the allowance for loan losses  management considers a number of factors relative to both specific credits in the loan portfolio and macro economic factors relative to the economy of the united states as a whole and the economy of the northwest ohio region in which the company does business 
factors relative to specific credits that are considered include a customer s payment history  a customer s recent financial performance  an assessment of the value of collateral held  knowledge of the customer s character  the financial strength and commitment of any guarantors  the existence of any customer or industry concentrations  changes in a customer s competitive environment  and any other issues that may impact a customer s ability to meet his obligations 
economic factors that are considered include levels of unemployment and inflation  specific plant or business closings in the company s market area  the impact of strikes or other work stoppages  the impact of weather or environmental conditions  especially relative to agricultural borrowers and other matters than may have an impact on the economy as a whole 
in addition to the identification of specific customer s who may be potential credit problems  management considers its historical losses  the results of independent loan reviews  an assessment of the adherence to underwriting standards  the loss experience being reported by other financial institutions operating in the company s market area  and other factors in providing for loan losses that have not been specifically classified 
while management believes its allowance for loan losses is conservatively determined based on the above factors  it does not believe the allowances to be excessive or unnecessary

valuation of mortgage servicing rights first defiance believes the valuations of mortgage servicing rights is a critical accounting policy that requires significant estimates in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
first defiance recognizes as separate assets the value of mortgage servicing rights  which are acquired through loan origination activities 
first defiance does not purchase any mortgage servicing rights 
key assumptions made by management relative to the valuation of mortgage servicing rights include the stratification policy used in valuing servicing  assumptions relative to future prepayments of mortgages  the potential value of any escrow deposits maintained or ancillary income received as a result of the servicing activity and discount rates used to value the present value of a future cash flow stream 
in assessing the value of the mortgage servicing rights portfolio  management utilizes a third party that specializes in valuing servicing portfolios 
that third party reviews key assumptions with management prior to completing the valuation 
prepayment speeds are determined based on projected median prepayment speeds for and year mortgage backed securities 
those speeds are then adjusted up or down based on the size of the loan 
the discount rate used in this analysis is the pretax yield generally required by purchasers of bulk servicing rights as of the valuation date 
the value of mortgage servicing rights is especially vulnerable in a falling interest rate environment 
refer also to the section entitled mortgage servicing rights and note  statement of accounting policies  and note  mortgage banking  for a further description of first defiance s valuation process  methodology and assumptions along with sensitivity analyses 
sfas deferral of fees first defiance believes that sfas no 
deferral of fees is a critical accounting policy that utilizes estimates in its preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
first defiance accounts for loan origination and commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs by deferring the net fees  or net costs  and amortizing them as an adjustment of the related loan s yield 
while the amount of fees to be deferred is generally apparent in the origination of a loan  the amount of costs  especially indirect or allocated costs to defer is a judgment that management makes based various time studies and cost accounting assumptions 
the time studies are updated annually to assure that loan origination procedures have not changed materially 
in addition  standard costs utilized in this analysis are also updated annually

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk asset liability management a significant portion of the company s revenues and net income is derived from net interest income and  accordingly  the company strives to manage its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to generate an appropriate contribution from net interest income 
asset and liability management seeks to control the volatility of the company s performance due to changes in interest rates 
the company attempts to achieve an appropriate relationship between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
first defiance does not presently use off balance sheet derivatives to enhance its risk management 
first defiance monitors interest rate risk on a monthly basis through simulation analysis that measures the impact changes in interest rates can have on net interest income 
the simulation technique analyzes the effect of a presumed basis point shift in interest rates which is consistent with management s estimate of the range of potential interest rate fluctuations and takes into account prepayment speeds on amortizing financial instruments  loan and deposit volumes and rates  non maturity deposit assumptions and capital requirements 
the results of the simulation indicate that in an environment where interest rates rise basis points over a month period  first defiance s net interest income would increase by just over the base case scenario 
were interest rates to fall by basis points during the same month period  the simulation indicates that net interest income would decrease by only 
it should be noted that other areas of first defiance s income statement  such as gains from sales of mortgage loans and amortization of mortgage servicing rights are also impacted by fluctuations in interest rates but are not considered in the simulation of net interest income 
first defiance has increased its lending activities in the non residential real estate and commercial loan areas 
while such loans carry higher credit risk than residential mortgage lending  they tend to be more rate sensitive than residential mortgage loans 
the balance of first defiance s non residential and multi family real estate loan portfolio was million  which is split between million of fixed rate loans and million of adjustable rate loans at december  the commercial loan portfolio increased to million  which is split between million of fixed rate loans and million of adjustable rate loans at december  certain of the loans classified as adjustable have fixed rates for an initial term that may be as long as five years 
the maturities on fixed rate loans are generally less than years 
first defiance also has significant balances of consumer loans million at december  which tend to have a shorter duration than residential mortgage loans  and home equity and improvement loans million at december  which fluctuate with changes in the prime lending rate 
also  to limit its interest rate risk  first federal sold approximately of its fixed rate mortgage originations into the secondary market in in addition to the simulation analysis  first federal also prepares an economic value of equity eve analysis 
this analysis calculates the net present value of first federal s assets and liabilities in rate shock environments that range from basis points to basis points 
the results of this analysis are reflected in the following table 
december  economic value of equity as of economic value of equity present value of assets change in rates amount change change ratio change dollars in thousands bp  bp bp  bp bp  bp   bp bp   bp based on the above analysis  in the event of a basis point increase in interest rates as of december   first federal would experience a increase in its economic value of equity 
if rates would fall by basis points its economic value of equity would decline by 
during periods of rising rates  the value of monetary assets declines 
conversely  during periods of falling rates  the value of monetary assets increases 
it should be noted that the amount of change in value of specific assets and liabilities due to changes in rates is not the same in a rising rate environment as in a falling rate environment 
based on the eve analysis  the change in the economic value of equity in both rising and falling rate environments is generally negligible because both its assets and liabilities have relatively short durations and the durations are fairly closely matched 
the average duration of its assets at december  was years while the average duration of its liabilities was years 
in evaluating first federal s exposure to interest rate risk  certain shortcomings inherent in the each of the methods of analysis presented must be considered 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market rates while interest rates on other types of financial instruments may lag behind current changes in market rates 
furthermore  in the event of changes in rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels could differ significantly from the assumptions in calculating the table and the results therefore may differ from those presented
