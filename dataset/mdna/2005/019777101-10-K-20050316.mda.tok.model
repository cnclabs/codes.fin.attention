item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview allos therapeutics  inc is a biopharmaceutical company that is focused on developing and commercializing innovative small molecule drugs for improving cancer treatments 
small molecule drugs  in general  are non protein products produced by chemical synthesis rather than biological methods 
we strive to develop drugs that improve the treatment of cancer and enhance the power of current therapies 
our goal is to build a profitable company by generating income from products we develop and commercialize  either alone or together with one or more potential strategic partners 
our focus is on product opportunities that leverage our internal clinical development and regulatory expertise and address important medical markets 
we have three product candidates that are currently under development  efaproxyn efaproxiral  formerly known as rsr  pdx pralatrexate and rh in addition  we endeavor to grow our existing portfolio of product candidates through ongoing product acquisition and in licensing efforts 
we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and clinical development 
we have never generated any revenue from product sales and have experienced significant net losses since our inception in for the years ended december   and  we had net losses of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue incurring net losses for the foreseeable future 
the presence and size of these potential net losses will depend  in large part  on if and when we receive regulatory approval in the united states or europe to market efaproxyn as an adjunct to radiation therapy for the treatment of brain metastases from breast cancer 
our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability is dependent on our ability  alone or with partners  to successfully complete the development of our product candidates  conduct clinical trials  obtain the necessary regulatory approvals  and manufacture and market our product candidates 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  and investments in marketable securities 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  along with the million of net proceeds from the march exchangeable preferred financing described below  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next twenty four months

results of operations comparison of years ended december   and research and development 
research and development expenses include the costs of basic research  nonclinical studies  clinical trials  regulatory affairs  biostatistical data analysis  patents and licensing fees for new products 
years ended december  in millions research and development expenses  as reported stock based compensation expense recovery the million decrease from to was due primarily to i a million decrease in costs relating to our phase reach trial  for which we completed enrollment in  and ii a million up front license fee paid in for pdx  offset by a a million increase in costs relating to our phase trial of efaproxyn in nsclc  b a million impairment charge recorded in relating to our investment in n gene research laboratories  inc n gene  and c a  increase in trial costs for pdx 
the million decrease from to was due primarily to i a million decrease resulting from close out costs recorded in relating to the termination of our phase trial of efaproxyn in nsclc  ii a million decrease in personnel costs due to headcount reductions  and iii a million impairment charge recorded in relating to our investment in n gene  offset by a a million increase in costs relating to our phase enrich trial  b a million milestone payment paid in under our license agreement for pdx  and c a  increase in regulatory fees for our maa filing in we expect research and development expenses to increase in  due primarily to costs associated with increasing enrollment in our phase enrich trial and our phase trial of efaproxyn in patients with nsclc 
the amount and timing of the increased costs related to our clinical trials is difficult to predict due to the uncertainty inherent in the timing of clinical trial initiations  the rate of patient enrollment and the detailed design of future trials 
we charge direct internal and external research and development expenses to the respective development programs 
since our inception through december   we have incurred direct costs of approximately million  million and  associated with the research and development expenses of efaproxyn  pdx and rh respectively  and an aggregate of approximately million associated with our other research and development programs  including programs that have been discontinued 
we also incur indirect costs that are not allocated to specific programs because such costs benefit multiple development programs 
these consist primarily of salaries and benefits  facilities costs and other internal shared resources related to the development and maintenance of systems and processes applicable to all of our programs 
unallocated costs since inception represent an aggregate of approximately million of research and development expenses incurred during such period 
the following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and years ended december  in millions efaproxyn pdx rh other programs unallocated total research and development expenses the timing and costs to complete the successful development of any of our product candidates are highly uncertain  and therefore difficult to estimate 
the lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals for our product candidates  and the subsequent compliance with applicable regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
for a more complete discussion of the regulatory approval process  please refer to the government regulation section of item i above 
clinical development timelines  likelihood of success and total costs vary widely and are impacted by a variety of factors discussed in the risk factors section of item i above 
because of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot predict when or whether we will successfully complete the development of any of our product candidates or the ultimate costs of such efforts 
due to these same factors  we cannot be certain when  or if  any net cash inflow from any of our current product candidates will commence 
clinical manufacturing 
clinical manufacturing expenses include third party manufacturing costs for efaproxyn for use in clinical trials  costs associated with pre commercial scale up of manufacturing to support anticipated commercial requirements  and development activities for clinical trial material for pdx 
years ended december  in millions clinical manufacturing expenses the million increase from to was due primarily to i a million termination fee paid in associated with the cancellation of our purchase orders for efaproxyn bulk drug substance that were placed in preparation for commercialization and ii increased development work performed in to produce clinical trial drug material for pdx 
the million decrease from to was due primarily to i the million termination fee paid in associated with the cancellation of our purchase orders for efaproxyn bulk drug substance that had been placed in anticipation of commercialization  ii a  decrease in third party manufacturing costs for efaproxyn  pdx and bgp  a compound for which the company discontinued development in  iii a  decrease in personnel costs due to headcount reductions  and iv a  decrease in consulting costs 
we currently have a sufficient supply of efaproxyn bulk drug substance and formulated drug product to support our efaproxyn clinical trial requirements for in addition  we currently have a sufficient supply of pdx bulk drug substance to support our pdx clinical trial requirements for  although we may need to purchase additional quantities of pdx formulated drug product 
as a result  we expect clinical manufacturing expenses to decrease moderately in as compared to marketing  general and administrative 
marketing  general and administrative expenses include costs for pre marketing activities  executive administration  corporate offices and related infrastructure  and corporate development 
years ended december  in millions marketing  general and administrative  as reported stock based compensation expense recovery the  increase from to was due primarily to fees and expenses of  incurred in in connection with our settlement of claims with n gene 
the  decrease from to was due primarily to i a  decrease in fees and expenses relating to the n gene settlement  and ii decreases in insurance costs and marketing expenses of  and  respectively  offset by a a  increase in expenses incurred in relating to our compliance efforts with the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations 
we expect marketing  general and administrative expenses for to remain approximately level with restructuring costs 
we recorded  in restructuring costs during the year ended december  the restructuring expenses include severance and other employee termination costs of approximately  and legal fees of  as of december  and  there was no remaining liability related to the restructuring 
gain on settlement claims 
in  we recognized a gain on settlement claims of approximately million in connection with our receipt of a one time settlement fee from durus life sciences master fund  ltd 
relating to short swing trading liabilities under section b of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
interest and other income  net 
interest income  net of interest expense  for  and was million   and  respectively 
the million and  decrease in and  respectively  primarily resulted from lower average investment balances and lower yields on united states government securities  high grade commercial paper and corporate notes and money market funds 
income taxes 
as of december   we have approximately million of net operating loss nol carryforwards  approximately million of research and development r d credit carryforwards and a  orphan drug credit carryforward 
these carryforwards will expire beginning in the utilization of these carryforwards to reduce future income taxes will depend on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of these carryforwards 
the internal revenue code of  as amended  contains provisions that may limit the nol  r d credit  and orphan drug credit carryforwards available for use in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events  including significant changes in ownership interest and are subject to review and possible adjustment by the internal revenue service 
a greater than change in ownership of a company within a three year period results in an annual limitation on our ability to utilize our nol  r d credit and orphan drug credit carryforwards from tax periods prior to the ownership change 
our nol  r d credit and orphan drug credit carryforwards as of december  will likely be subject to annual limitation due to changes in ownership from the march series a exchangeable preferred stock financing and previous financings 
the amount of these limitations  if any  is unknown  and our nol  r d credit and orphan drug credit carryforwards may expire unused 
additionally  future ownership changes could further limit the utilization of our nol  r d credit and orphan drug credit carryforwards 
stock based compensation expense recovery 
we have recorded stock based compensation expense resulting primarily from certain options granted prior to our initial public offering with exercise prices below the fair market value of our common stock on their respective grant dates 
during  we recorded million of stock based compensation expense in marketing  general and administrative expenses  a million net recovery of stock based compensation expense in research and development expenses and  of stock based compensation expense in clinical manufacturing expenses 
the recovery of stock based compensation expense recorded in research and development is due to the cancellation of a former employee s unvested options in  resulting in the recovery of million of stock based compensation expense recorded in prior periods 
during  we recorded a net recovery of stock based compensation expense of  in marketing  general and administrative expenses  and stock based compensation expense of  and  in research and development and clinical manufacturing expenses  respectively 
the net recovery of stock based compensation expense recorded in marketing  general and administrative is due to the change in employment status of our chairman from an employee to a consultant  resulting in the recovery of expenses totaling  related to stock based compensation expense on unvested stock options recorded in prior periods  partially offset by  of other stock based compensation expense for during  we recorded  in stock based compensation expense 
at december   we had  of unamortized deferred compensation remaining to be expensed in future years 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of common and preferred stock  a public equity financing  and interest income  which have resulted in net proceeds to us of million through december  we have used million of cash for operating activities through december  cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments in marketable securities were million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
working capital was million and million at december  and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
cash used in operating activities was primarily to fund net losses  excluding non cash charges 
net cash provided by investing activities for  and was million  million and million  respectively  and consisted primarily of proceeds from the maturities of investments in marketable securities  partially offset by the purchase of short term investments in marketable securities  acquisition of property and equipment and the investment in equity of another company in net cash provided by financing activities during   and was million  million  and  respectively  and resulted from the private sale of common stock  exercise of common stock options  and proceeds from sales of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
below is a schedule of timing of contractual commitments related to our leases and service contracts 
we currently have no off balance sheet arrangements 
less than year years years more than years total operating leases     other long term obligations   total contractual cash obligations    other long term obligations represent future milestone payments under our license agreement for pdx  due upon the passage of certain time periods after the effective date of the agreement  which could be paid earlier depending on the timing of achieving a development milestone 
based upon the current status of our product development and commercialization plans  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  and investments in marketable securities  along with the million of net proceeds from the march series a exchangeable preferred stock financing  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next twenty four months 
we anticipate continuing our current development programs and or beginning other long term development projects on new products or technologies 
these projects may require many years and substantial expenditures to complete and may ultimately be unsuccessful 
therefore  we may need to obtain additional funds from outside sources to continue research and development activities  fund operating expenses  pursue regulatory approvals and build sales and marketing capabilities  as necessary 
however  our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the status of our product development programs  the time and cost involved in conducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals  the time and cost involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  and our ability to market and distribute our future products and establish new collaborative and licensing arrangements 
we may raise additional capital in the future through arrangements with corporate partners  equity or debt financings  or from other sources 
such arrangements  if successfully consummated  may be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
however  there is no assurance that we will be successful in consummating any such arrangements 
in addition  in the event that additional funds are obtained through arrangements with collaborative partners or other sources  such arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies  product candidates or products under development that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
if we are unable to generate meaningful amounts of revenue from future product sales  if any  or cannot otherwise raise sufficient additional funds to support our operations  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our development programs and our business and future prospects for revenue and profitability may be harmed 
critical accounting policies our results of operations and financial position are determined based on the application of our accounting policies  as discussed in the notes to the financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our critical accounting policies are important to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and the results presented in the financial statements require management to make judgments and estimates that are inherently uncertain 
we record the costs of clinical studies  clinical development  finished drug inventory  regulatory affairs  biostatistical data analysis  non clinical studies  basic research and licensing fees as a component to research and development expenses 
clinical study costs represent internal costs from personnel  external costs incurred at clinical sites and contracted costs incurred by third party clinical research organizations to perform certain clinical trials 
we are obligated to make certain upfront payments upon execution of certain research and developments agreements 
we record these upfront payments as prepaid research and development expenses 
such payments are expensed as services are performed or terms of the respective agreements are achieved 
we accrue research and development expenses for activity as incurred during the fiscal year and prior to receiving invoices from clinical sites and third party clinical research organizations 
we accrue external costs for clinical studies based on the progress of the clinical trials  including patient enrollment  dosing levels of patients enrolled  estimated costs to dose patients  and contracted costs with clinical research organizations and clinical sites 
we record internal costs primarily related to personnel in clinical development  regulatory affairs and biostatistical data analysis and external costs related to non clinical studies and basic research as incurred 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions 
we performed a sensitivity analysis on our accrual for external costs related to our clinical studies as of december  we considered the timing of patient dosing and determined that the effect was immaterial when accruing at enrollment or upon final dosing in comparison to our policy 
we record upfront fees and milestone payments made under our licensing agreements as a research and development expense 
our finished drug inventory is expensed to research and development since we are still a development stage company and we have not received regulatory approval to market efaproxyn 
after regulatory approval  we will be required to capitalize any future costs of our marketed products at the lower of cost or market 
the timing of future payments for finished drug inventory in relation to the timing of regulatory approval may cause variability in our future cost of goods sold and clinical manufacturing expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk and all are classified as held to maturity 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we maintain a non trading investment portfolio of investment grade  liquid debt securities that limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer  or type of instrument 
the average duration of all of our investments is less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosure is provided
