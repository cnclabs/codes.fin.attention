table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview headquartered in oakland  california  golden west financial corporation is one of the nation s largest financial institutions with assets of billion as of december  the company s principal operating subsidiary is world savings bank  fsb wsb 
wsb has a subsidiary  world savings bank  fsb texas wtx 
as of december   we operated savings branches in ten states and had lending operations in states under the world name 
our business model we are a residential mortgage portfolio lender 
in order to increase net earnings under this business model  we focus principally on growing net interest income  which is the difference between the interest and dividends earned on loans and other investments and the interest paid on customer deposits and borrowings  maintaining a healthy primary spread  which is the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of deposits and borrowings  expanding the adjustable rate mortgage arm portfolio  which is our primary earning asset  managing interest rate risk  principally by originating and retaining monthly adjusting arms in portfolio  and matching these arms with liabilities that respond in a similar manner to changes in interest rates  managing credit risk  principally by originating high quality loans to minimize nonperforming assets and troubled debt restructured  maintaining a strong capital position to support growth and provide operating flexibility  controlling expenses  and managing operations risk through strong internal controls 
in review we had a strong year in with substantial growth in net interest income driven primarily by the expansion of our loan portfolio 
our volume of arm originations reached record levels 
partially offsetting the benefit to net interest income of a larger average earning asset balance in was a decrease in our average primary spread 
the average primary spread decreased as short term interest rates increased in and the yield on the company s earning assets responded more slowly than interest rates on our deposits and borrowings 
our financial highlights include the following diluted earnings per share reached a record of  up from the reported in amounts reflect the december two for one stock split  net interest income grew to a record high of billion  despite an average primary spread that compressed from during to in we had record originations of billion as compared to billion for  of originations in were arms as compared to in  our arm portfolio increased to a record high of billion  up from billion at yearend  
table of contents nonperforming assets and troubled debt restructured remained at very low levels  and for a seventh straight year our ratio of net chargeoffs to average loans and mbs was zero basis points  our capital expanded to a record level of billion  up from the billion reported at yearend  our stockholders equity to asset ratio was at december   even with high asset growth  and our general and administrative expense to average assets ratio fell from

we originate and retain these loans in portfolio 
as discussed below  we emphasize arms with interest rates that change monthly to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk 
we sell most of the fixed rate loans that we originate  as well as loans that customers convert from arms to fixed rate loans 
loans receivable and mortgage backed securities the following table shows the components of our loans receivable and mortgage backed securities mbs portfolio at december    and 
table of contents table balance of loans receivable and mbs by component dollars in thousands december loans securitized loans a other b total loans receivable mbs with recourse c purchased mbs total mbs total loans receivable and mbs arms as a percentage of total loans receivable and mbs a loans securitized after march  are classified as securitized loans and included in loans receivable 
b includes loans in process  net deferred loan costs  allowance for loan losses  and other miscellaneous discounts 
c loans securitized prior to april  are classified as mbs with recourse held to maturity 
the balance of loans receivable and mbs is affected primarily by loan originations and loan and mbs repayments 
the following table provides information about our loan originations and loan and mbs repayments for the years ended   and table loan originations and repayments dollars in millions year ended december loan originations real estate loans originated arms as a of originations fixed rate mortgages as a of originations refinances as a of originations purchases as a of originations first mortgages originated for portfolio as a of originations first mortgages originated for sale as a of originations repayments loan and mbs repayments a loan repayment rate b a loan and mbs repayments consist of monthly amortization and loan payoffs 
b the loan repayment rate is the annual repayments as a percentage of the prior year s ending loan and mbs balance 
the volume of our originations increased substantially in versus due to an increase in the popularity of adjustable rate mortgages 
arms increased significantly as a percentage of mortgage originations nationwide because the rates and payments on these loans remained lower than those on the more traditional fixed rate mortgages 
we were able to take advantage of the favorable environment for arm lending in because we focus on arms and because of prior investments that increased the capacity of our loan operations 

table of contents loan and mbs repayments  including amortization and loan payoffs  were higher in as compared to as a result of an increase in the portfolio balance partially offset by a slight decrease in the repayment rate 
repayments were high in because interest rates remained very low and both home purchases and refinance activity remained high 
equity lines of credit and fixed rate second mortgages most of our loans are collateralized by first deeds of trust on one to four family homes 
however  we also originate a small volume of fixed rate second mortgages secured by second deeds of trust  most of which we have historically sold 
we also offer borrowers equity lines of credit elocs indexed to the prime rate 
these elocs are collateralized typically by second deeds of trust and occasionally by first deeds of trust 
our general practice is to only originate second deeds of trust on properties that have a first mortgage with us 
the following table provides information about our activity in fixed rate second mortgages and elocs in the past three years 
table equity lines of credit and fixed rate second mortgages dollars in thousands year ended december equity lines of credit new elocs established eloc outstanding balance eloc maximum total line of credit available fixed rate second mortgages fixed rate second mortgage originations sales of second mortgages fixed rate seconds held for sale fixed rate seconds held for investment net deferred loan costs included in the balance of loans receivable are net deferred loan costs associated with originating loans 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we defer loan origination fees and certain loan origination costs 
over the past five years  the combined amounts have resulted in net deferred costs 
these net deferred loan costs are amortized as a yield reduction over the contractual life of the related loans  thereby lowering net interest income and the reported yield on our loan portfolio 
if a loan pays off before the end of its contractual life  any remaining net deferred cost is charged to loan interest income at that time 

table of contents the following table provides information on net deferred loan costs for the years ended december    and table net deferred loan costs dollars in thousands year ended december beginning balance of net deferred loan costs net loan costs deferred amortization of net deferred loan costs net deferred loan costs fees transferred from mbs ending balance of net deferred loan costs the growth in deferred loan costs in the past two years has resulted primarily from the growth in loan origination volume 
lending operations at december   we had lending operations in states 
our largest source of mortgage origination volume has been loans secured by residential properties in california  which is the largest residential mortgage market in the united states

securitization activity we often securitize our portfolio loans into mortgage backed securities 
we do this because mbs are a more valuable form of collateral for our borrowings than whole loans 
because we have retained all of the beneficial interests in these mbs securitizations to date  the accounting rules require that securitizations formed after march  be classified as securitized loans and included in our loans receivable 
securitization activity for the years ended december    and  amounted to billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
the volume of securitization activity fluctuates depending on the amount of collateral needed for borrowings and liquidity risk management 
loans securitized prior to april  are classified as mbs with recourse held to maturity 
mbs that are classified as held to maturity are those that we have the ability and intent to hold until maturity 
structural features of our arms most of the arms that we originated in  and that we have been originating since  have the following structural features that are described in more detail below an interest rate that changes monthly and is based on an index plus a fixed margin set at origination  a monthly payment amount that changes annually  features that allow for deferred interest to accrue on the loans  and lifetime interest rate caps  and in some cases interest rate floors  that limit the range of interest rates on the loans 

table of contents in addition to the monthly adjusting arms described above  we originate and have in portfolio a small volume of arms with initial interest rates and monthly payments that are fixed for periods of to months  after which the interest rate adjusts monthly and the monthly payment is reset annually 
additionally  we originate a small volume of arms with interest only payments for the first five years and an interest rate that adjusts every six months subject to a periodic interest rate cap 
from time to time  as part of our efforts to retain loans and loan customers  we may waive or temporarily modify certain terms of a loan 
additionally  some borrowers choose to convert an arm to a fixed rate mortgage 
during  million of loans were converted at the customer s request from arms to fixed rate loans  compared to billion and million in and  respectively 
we sell most of the converted fixed rate loans 
interest rates and indexes 
almost all the arms we originate have interest rates that change monthly based on an index plus a fixed margin that is set at the time we make the loan 
the index value changes monthly and consequently the loan rate changes monthly 
for most of our lending  the indexes are the certificate of deposit index codi  the golden west cost of savings index cosi or the eleventh district cost of funds index cofi 
details about these indexes  including the reporting and repricing lags associated with them  are discussed in asset liability management 
the elocs we originate are indexed to the prime rate as published in the money rates table in the wall street journal central edition 
as further described in asset liability management  we have focused on originating arms with indexes that meet our customers needs and match well with our liabilities 
the following table shows the distribution of arm originations by index for the years ending december    and table adjustable rate mortgage originations by index dollars in thousands year ended december arm index of total of total of total codi cosi cofi prime a total a as of january  includes fundings of new elocs indexed to the prime rate

monthly payment amount 
for substantially all of our arms  the borrower s minimum monthly payment is reset annually 
the new monthly payment amount each year is usually calculated to be the amount necessary to amortize the outstanding loan balance at the then applicable interest rate over the remaining term of the loan 
the new monthly payment amount generally cannot exceed the prior year s monthly payment amount by more than 
periodically  this cap does not apply 
for example  for most of the loans this cap does not apply on the tenth annual payment change of the loan and every fifth annual payment change thereafter 
for other loans  the cap does not apply on the fifth annual payment change of the loan and every fifth annual payment change thereafter 
on each annual payment change date when the cap does not apply  the new monthly payment amount will be set to an amount that would fully amortize the loan over its remaining term 
substantially all of the arms we originate allow the borrowers to select a fixed monthly payment amount for an interim period after origination  typically one year 
after this interim period  the monthly payment amount resets annually as described above 
the amount of the initial payment can range from a minimum payment that we set which may be lower than the amount of interest accruing on the loan to a fully amortizing payment 
the monthly statement for most of our loans provides our borrowers with up to four payment options 
these payment options include a fully amortizing payment  an interest only payment  a minimum payment  and a payment that enables the loan to pay off years from origination 
in addition to these four specified payment options  borrowers may elect a payment of any amount above the minimum payment 
although most of our loans have payments due on a monthly cycle  a significant number of borrowers elect to make payments on a biweekly cycle 
a biweekly payment cycle results in a shorter period required to fully amortize the loan

for more than years  our arms have allowed deferred interest to occur if the borrower s monthly payment is not large enough to pay the monthly interest accruing on the loan 
deferred interest refers to the amount of unpaid interest that is added to the outstanding principal balance 
borrowers always have the option to make a high enough monthly payment to avoid deferred interest  and many borrowers do so 
borrowers may also pay down the balance of deferred interest in whole or in part at any time without a prepayment fee 
our loans provide that deferred interest may occur as long as the loan balance remains below either or of the original mortgage amount 
the cap on deferred interest applies to loans with original loan to value ratios at or below 
the cap applies to loans with original loan to value ratios above 
if the loan balance reaches the applicable limit  additional deferred interest may not be allowed to occur and we may increase the monthly payment to an amount that would amortize the loan over its remaining term 
in this case  the new monthly payment amount could increase beyond the annual payment cap described above  and continue to increase each month thereafter  if the applicable deferred interest cap is still being reached and the current monthly payment amount would not be enough to fully amortize the loan by the scheduled maturity date 
as of december   we did not have any loans in our portfolio that had reached the applicable limit on deferred interest 
the amount of deferred interest that accrued in the loan portfolio amounted to million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
the amount of deferred interest that may occur in the loan portfolio is uncertain and is influenced by a number of factors outside our control  including changes in the underlying index  the amount and timing of borrowers monthly payments  and unscheduled principal payments 
if the applicable index were to increase and remain at relatively high levels  the amount of deferred interest occurring in the loan portfolio would be expected to trend higher  absent other mitigating factors such as increased prepayments or borrowers making monthly payments that meet or exceed the amount of interest then accruing on their mortgage loan 
similarly  if the index were to decline and remain at relatively low levels  the amount of deferred interest occurring in the loan portfolio would be expected to trend lower 
lifetime caps and floors 
virtually all of our arms are subject to a lifetime cap 
during the life of a typical arm loan  the interest rate may not be raised above a lifetime cap which is set at the time of origination or assumption 
the weighted average maximum lifetime cap rate on our arm loan portfolio including mbs before any reduction for loan servicing and guarantee fees was or above the actual weighted average rate at december   versus or above the actual weighted average rate at yearend and or above the weighted average rate at yearend 
table of contents the following table shows the company s arm loans by lifetime cap bands as of december  table adjustable rate mortgage portfolio by lifetime cap bands december  dollars in thousands cap bands arm balance number of loans of total balance less than or greater a no cap total a includes billion of one to four family elocs  most of which have an cap 
a portion of our arms are subject to lifetime floors 
at december   approximately billion of our arm loans including mbs with recourse held to maturity have terms that state that the interest rate may not fall below a lifetime floor set at the time of origination or assumption 
as of december   billion of arm loans had reached their rate floors  compared to billion at december   and billion at december  the weighted average floor rate on the loans that had reached their floor was at yearend compared to at yearend and at yearend without the floor  the average rate on these loans would have been at december   at december   and at december  securities available for sale we invest funds not immediately needed to fund our loan operations in short term instruments  primarily in federal funds  short term repurchase agreements collateralized by mbs  and eurodollar time deposits 
our practice is to invest only with counterparties that have high credit ratings 
in addition to short term investments  we hold stock in federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac that we obtained in with a cost basis of million 
the following table is a summary of information about investment securities  which the company classifies as available for sale and are reported at fair value

we had no securities held for trading during   and other assets capitalized mortgage servicing rights the company recognizes as assets the rights to service loans for others 
when we retain the servicing rights upon the sale of loans  the allocated cost of these rights is capitalized as an asset and then amortized over the expected life of the loan 
the amount capitalized is based on the relative fair value of the servicing rights and the loan on the sale date 
we do not have a large portfolio of mortgage servicing rights  primarily because we retain our arm originations in portfolio and only sell a limited number of fixed rate loans to third parties 
the balance of capitalized mortgage servicing rights cmsrs at december    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
cmsrs are included in other assets on the consolidated statement of financial condition 
the estimated fair value of cmsrs is regularly reviewed and can change up or down depending on market conditions 
we stratify the serviced loans by year of origination or modification  term to maturity  and loan type 
if the estimated fair value of a loan strata is less than its book value  we establish a valuation allowance for the estimated temporary impairment through a charge to noninterest income 
we also recognize any other than temporary impairment as a direct write down 
the estimated fair value of cmsrs as of december    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the book value of the company s cmsrs for certain of the company s loan strata exceeded the fair value by million at december  as a result  an impairment valuation allowance of million was recorded in the book value of the company s cmsrs did not exceed the fair value at december  or and  therefore  no valuation allowance for impairment was required 

table of contents deposits we raise deposits through our retail branch system  through the internet  and  from time to time  through the money markets 
retail deposits increased by billion in compared to increases of billion and billion in and  respectively 
retail deposits increased during these three years because the public found insured money market and savings accounts to be a more favorable investment compared with other alternatives  and we also received favorable customer response to our promoted products 
at december   transaction accounts represented of the total balance of deposits  compared to and at yearends and  respectively 
these transaction accounts included checking accounts  money market deposit accounts  and passbook accounts including most of the balance of the promoted account described below 
during the second half of  the savings product that we principally promoted had elements of both a certificate of deposit and a passbook savings account 
this product allowed customers to lock in a favorable rate on the entire balance in the account for a specified term  and also gave customers the flexibility to make withdrawals from the account at any time  without penalty  down to a specified minimum balance 
customers were also allowed to make additional deposits into this account up to a specified maximum balance 
borrowings in addition to funding real estate loans with deposits  we also utilize borrowings 
most of our borrowings are variable interest rate instruments and are tied to the london interbank offered rate libor 
in  borrowings increased by billion to billion from billion at yearend in order to fund the loan growth described earlier 
advances from federal home loan banks an important type of borrowing we use comes from the federal home loan banks fhlbs 
these borrowings are known as advances 
wsb is a member of the fhlb of san francisco  and wtx is a member of the fhlb of dallas 
advances are secured by pledges of certain loans  mbs  and capital stock of the fhlbs that we own 
fhlb advances amounted to billion at december   compared to billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
other borrowings in addition to borrowing from the fhlbs  we borrow from other sources to maintain flexibility in managing the availability and cost of funds for the company 
we borrow funds from the capital markets on both a secured and unsecured basis 
most of wsb s capital market funding consists of unsecured bank notes 
on november   wsb initiated a bank note program that allows us to issue an aggregate amount of billion of unsecured senior notes with maturities ranging from days to thirty years 
in december  wsb issued billion in notes under this program 
wsb also issued billion of unsecured senior notes in under a prior program  all of which were outstanding at december  bank notes with maturities exceeding days are reported as senior debt on the consolidated statement of financial condition 
as of december   wsb s unsecured senior debt ratings were aa and aa from moody s and s p  respectively 
wsb also has a short term bank note program under which up to billion of short term notes with maturities of less than days can be outstanding at any point in time 
wsb had billion  billion  and billion of short term bank notes outstanding as of december    and  respectively 
as of december   wsb s short term bank notes were rated p and a by moody s and s p  respectively 

table of contents we also borrow funds through transactions in which securities are sold under agreements to repurchase 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase are entered into with selected major government securities dealers and large banks  using mbs from our portfolio as collateral  and amounted to billion  billion  and million at december    and  respectively 
golden west  at the holding company level  occasionally issues senior or subordinated unsecured debt  although none was issued in at december   golden west  at the holding company level  had million of senior debt and no subordinated debt outstanding 
as of december   golden west s senior debt was rated a and a by moody s and s p  respectively  and its subordinated debt was rated a and a by moody s and s p  respectively 
management of risk our business strategy is to achieve sustainable earnings growth utilizing a low risk business approach 
we continue to execute and refine our business model to manage the key risks associated with being a residential mortgage portfolio lender  namely interest rate risk and credit risk 
we also manage other risks  such as operational  regulatory  and management risk 
management of interest rate risk overview interest rate risk generally refers to the risk that changes in market interest rates could adversely affect a company s financial condition 
we strive to manage interest rate risk through the operation of our business  rather than relying on capital market techniques such as derivatives 
our strategy for managing interest rate risk includes focusing on originating and retaining monthly adjusting arms in our portfolio  funding these arm assets with liabilities that respond in a similar manner to changes in market rates  and selling most of the limited number of fixed rate loans that we originate  as well as fixed rate loans that customers convert from arms 
as discussed further below  these strategies help us to maintain a close relationship between the yield on our assets and the cost of our liabilities throughout the interest rate cycle and thereby limit the sensitivity of net interest income and our primary spread to changes in market rates 
asset liability management our principal strategy to manage interest rate risk is to originate and keep in portfolio arms that provide interest sensitivity to the asset side of the balance sheet 
the interest rates on most of our arms adjust monthly  which means that the yield on our loan portfolio responds to movements in interest rates 
at december   arms constituted of our loan and mbs portfolio  and of our arm portfolio adjusted monthly 
additionally  we emphasize home loans tied to certain arm indexes so that these index rates and the rates on the liabilities that fund these arms respond in a similar manner to changes in market rates 
our arm index strategy strives to match portions of our arm portfolio with liabilities that have similar repricing characteristics  by which we mean the frequency of rate changes and the responsiveness of rate changes to fluctuations in market interest rates 
the following table describes the indexes we use and shows how these indexes are intended to match with our liabilities 

table of contents table summary of key indexes codi cosi cofi how the index is calculated based on a market rate  specifically the monthly yield of three month certificates of deposit secondary market  as published by the federal reserve board 
codi is calculated by adding the twelve most recently published monthly yields together and dividing the result by twelve 
equal to golden west s cost of deposits as reported monthly 
equal to the monthly average cost of deposits and borrowings of savings institution members of the federal home loan bank system s eleventh district  which is comprised of california  arizona  and nevada 
matching and activity levels how the index matches the company s liabilities historically  the three month cd yield on which codi is based has closely tracked libor 
most of our borrowings from the fhlbs and the capital markets are based on libor 
the month rolling aspect of codi creates a timing lag 
cosi equals our own cost of deposits 
cosi and the cost of our deposits are therefore matched subject only to the reporting lag described below 
historically  cofi has tracked our cost of deposits 
the match is not perfect since cofi includes the cost of savings and borrowings of many other institutions as well as our own 
percentage of arm originations percentage of arm portfolio at timing lags see descriptions in the paragraph below reporting lag one month one month two months repricing lag yes  because codi is a month rolling average  and it takes time before the index is able to reflect  or catch up with  a change in market rates 
yes  because the rates paid on many of our deposits may not respond immediately or fully to a change in market rates  but this lag is offset by the same repricing lag on our deposits 
yes  because the portfolio of liabilities comprising cofi do not all reprice immediately or fully to changes in market rates 
historically  this lag has been largely offset by a similar repricing lag on our deposits 
the primary difference between our arms and liabilities is timing relating to how quickly our arms and liabilities reprice 
our liabilities tend to reprice more quickly than our arm portfolio  primarily because of built in reporting and repricing lags identified in the table above that are inherent in the indexes 
reporting lags occur because of the time it takes to gather the data needed to compute the indexes 
repricing lags occur because it may take a period of time before changes in market interest rates are significantly reflected in the indexes 
in addition to the index lags  other structural features of the arms  described under structural features of our arms  can delay the repricing of our assets 

table of contents this timing disparity between our assets and liabilities can temporarily affect our primary spread until the indexes are able to reflect  or catch up with  the market rates 
over a full interest rate cycle  the timing lags will tend to offset one another 
the following chart summarizes the different relationships the indexes and short term market interest rates could have at any point in time  and the expected impact on our primary spread 
table relationship between indexes and short term market interest rates and expected impact on primary spread market interest rate scenarios relationship between indexes and short term market interest rates and expected impact on primary spread market interest rates increase the index increase lags the market interest rate increase  and therefore the primary spread would normally be expected to narrow temporarily until the index catches up with the higher market interest rates 
market interest rates decline the index decrease lags the market interest rate decrease  and therefore the primary spread would normally be expected to widen temporarily until the index catches up with the lower market interest rates 
market interest rates remain constant the primary spread would normally be expected to stabilize when the index catches up to the current market rate level 
as the table above indicates  although market rate changes do impact the primary spread  this is principally a timing issue until the market rates are reflected in the applicable index 
also  a gradual change in rates would tend to have less of an impact on the primary spread than a sharp rise or decline in rates 
as discussed above  market interest rate movements are the most significant factor that affects our primary spread 
the primary spread is also influenced by the shape of the yield curve the difference between short term and long term interest rates and competition in the home lending market  both of which influence the pricing of our adjustable and fixed rate mortgage products  our efforts to attract deposits and competition in the retail savings market  which influence the pricing of our deposit products  and the prices that we pay for our borrowings 
the table below shows the primary spread  and its main components  at december    and 
table of contents table yield on earning assets  cost of funds  and primary spread december yield on loan portfolio and mbs yield on investments yield on earning assets cost of deposits cost of borrowings cost of funds primary spread during  the federal reserve s open market committee raised the federal funds rate  a key short term interest rate  five times  bringing the rate up to at december  as compared to at december  as a consequence  our cost of funds  which is related primarily to the level of short term market interest rates  also increased 
at the same time  the yield on our earning assets responded more slowly due to the arm index lags described above 
the following table shows the average primary spread by quarter

financial institutions often provide a table with information about the repricing gap  which is the difference between the repricing of assets and liabilities 
the following gap table shows the volume of assets and liabilities that reprice within certain time periods as of december   as well as the repricing gap and the cumulative repricing gap as a percentage of assets 

table of contents table repricing of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  repricing gaps  and gap ratios as of december  dollars in millions projected repricing a months months years over years total earning assets securities available for sale mbs adjustable rate fixed rate loans receivable b c adjustable rate fixed rate held for investment fixed rate held for sale other d total interest bearing liabilities deposits e fhlb advances other borrowings impact of interest rate swaps total repricing gap cumulative gap cumulative gap as a percentage of total assets a based on scheduled maturity or scheduled repricing  loans and mbs reflect scheduled amortization and projected prepayments of principal based on current rates of prepayment 
b excludes nonaccrual loans days or more past due 
c includes loans in process 
loans in process are funded  interest earning loans that have not yet been entered into the loan servicing system due to the normal five to seven day processing lag 
d includes primarily cash in banks and federal home loan bank fhlb stock 
e liabilities with no maturity date  such as checking  passbook  and money market deposit accounts  are assigned zero months 
if all repricing assets and liabilities responded equally to changes in the interest rate environment  then the gap analysis would suggest that our earnings would rise when interest rates increase and would fall when interest rates decrease 
however  as discussed above  our experience has been that the timing lags in our indexes tend to cause the rates on our liabilities to change more quickly than the yield on our assets 
the following table is a summary of our market risk on financial instruments 
it includes our expected cash flows and applicable yields on the balances of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities as of december   taking into consideration expected prepayments of our long term assets primarily mbs and loans receivable 
the table also includes the estimated current fair value of the assets and liabilities shown

f variable rate weighted average interest rate total a based on scheduled maturity or scheduled repricing loans and mbs reflect scheduled amortization and projected prepayments of principal based on current rates of prepayment 
b excludes loans in process  net deferred loan costs  allowance for loan losses  and other miscellaneous discounts 
c the total weighted average interest rate for variable rate loans receivable reflects loans with introductory rates in effect at december  those loans are assumed to mature outside the introductory period at fully indexed rates the fully indexed rate is equal to the effective index plus the loan margin 
consequently  the weighted average rate of all maturing variable rate loans will not equal the weighted average rate of total variable rate loans at december  as indicated in the total balance column 
d deposits with no maturity are included in the column 
e the company entered into two interest rate swaps to effectively convert certain fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
because the swaps qualify as fair value hedges  the debt is recorded at fair value 
f the effect of the swaps is reflected in the weighted average interest rate 
we estimate the sensitivity of our net interest income  net earnings  and capital ratios to interest rate changes and anticipated growth based on simulations using an asset liability model 
the simulation model projects net interest income  net earnings  and capital ratios based on a significant interest rate increase that is sustained for a thirty six month period 
the model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities which takes into account the lags previously described 
for mortgage assets  the model incorporates assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on prepayment rates  which are based on our historical prepayment information 
the model also factors in projections for loan and liability growth 
based on the information and assumptions in effect at december   a basis point rate increase sustained over a thirty six month period would initially  but temporarily  reduce our primary spread  and would not adversely affect our long term profitability and financial strength 

table of contents interest rate swaps we manage interest rate risk principally through the operation of our business 
on occasion  however  we do enter into derivative contracts  particularly interest rate swaps 
as of december   we had two interest rate swaps that were used to effectively convert payments on wsb s fixed rate senior debt to floating rate payments 
we entered into one such swap with a notional amount of million in june and another with a notional amount of million in december these interest rate swaps were designated as fair value hedges and qualified for what is called the shortcut method of hedge accounting 
because the swaps qualify for the shortcut method  an ongoing assessment of hedge effectiveness is not required  and the change in fair value of the hedged item is deemed to be equal to the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of these swaps had no impact on the consolidated statement of net earnings 
at december   we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
management of credit risk credit risk refers to the risk of loss if a borrower fails to perform under a mortgage loan and the value of the underlying collateral is not sufficient to cover the loan amount 
we manage credit risk principally by originating high quality loans that are reviewed by our underwriting and appraisal staff 
we also mitigate credit risk through periodic loan reviews 
additionally  we closely monitor market trends  and take appropriate steps to protect our interests 
our objective is to minimize nonperforming assets and troubled debt restructured and thereby maintain high profitability 
our business strategy does not involve assuming additional credit risk in the portfolio in order to be able to charge higher prices to consumers 
underwriting and appraisal process as part of our underwriting process  we evaluate the creditworthiness of potential borrowers based primarily on credit history and an evaluation of the potential borrower s ability to repay the loan 
we use systems developed internally based on years of experience evaluating credit risk 
although we use technological tools to help with underwriting evaluations  our underwriting personnel review each file and make final judgments 
when evaluating a borrower s ability to pay  we assess the ability to make fully amortizing monthly payments  even if the borrower has the option to make a lower initial monthly payment 
our appraisal process is separate from our underwriting process to assure independence and accountability 
we appraise the property that secures the loan by assessing its market value and marketability 
we maintain an in house staff to conduct and review property appraisals 
any external appraisers that we use are required to go through a training program with us  and each appraisal is reviewed by our internal appraisal staff 
california housing market although we originate a high volume of loans in california  we do virtually no lending in the more volatile high priced end of the california real estate market 
we have adopted this strategy in an effort to minimize our credit risk exposure to potential adverse conditions in california 
the average loan size for our california one to four family first mortgage originations in was approximately thousand 
loan to value ratio the loan to value ratio  or ltv  is the loan balance of a first mortgage expressed as a percentage of the appraised value of the property at the time of origination 
a combined loan to value  or cltv  refers to the sum 
table of contents of the first and second mortgage loan balances as a percentage of total appraised value at the time of origination 
when we discuss ltvs below  we are referring to cases when our borrower obtained only a first mortgage from us at origination 
when we discuss cltvs below  we are referring to cases when our borrower obtained both a first mortgage and a second mortgage from us at origination 
the second mortgage may be either a fixed rate loan or an eloc 
historically  loans with ltvs or cltvs greater than result in greater credit losses as compared to loans originated with ltvs or cltvs at or lower 
we therefore focus our lending activity on loans that have ltvs or cltvs at or below 
in addition  we take steps to reduce the potential credit risk with respect to new loans with ltvs or cltvs over 
among other things a significant percentage of first mortgage loans with ltvs over carry mortgage insurance  which reimburses us for losses up to a specified percentage per loan  thereby reducing the effective ltv to below  the ltv or cltv may not exceed of the appraised value of a single family residence at the time of origination  we carry pool mortgage insurance on most elocs and most fixed rate seconds held for investment when the cltv exceeds  the cumulative losses covered by this pool mortgage insurance are limited to or of the original balance of each insured pool  and we have sold without recourse a significant portion of our fixed rate second mortgage originations 
the following table shows mortgage originations with ltvs or cltvs greater than for the years ended december    and table mortgage originations with ltvs or cltvs greater than dollars in thousands year ended december first mortgages with ltvs greater than with mortgage insurance with no mortgage insurance total percentage of total originations first and second mortgages with cltvs greater than a with pool insurance on second mortgages with no pool insurance total percentage of total originations a for elocs  only amounts drawn at the establishment of the line of credit are included in originations

the cltv data in and includes eloc amounts drawn at origination  while the cltv data does not 

table of contents at december    and  the aggregate average of ltvs and cltvs on the loans in portfolio was   and  respectively 
we believe that by emphasizing ltvs below  and insuring most loans with ltvs or cltvs above  we have helped to mitigate our exposure to a disruption in the real estate market that could cause property values to decline 
nonetheless  it is reasonable to expect that a significant decline in the values of residential real estate could result in increased rates of delinquencies  foreclosures  and losses 
asset quality an important measure of the soundness of our loan and mbs portfolio is the ratio of nonperforming assets npas and troubled debt restructured tdrs to total assets 
nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans that is  loans  including loans securitized into mbs with recourse  that are days or more past due and real estate acquired through foreclosure 
no interest is recognized on nonaccrual loans 
tdrs are made up of loans on which delinquent payments have been capitalized or on which temporary interest rate reductions have been made  primarily to customers impacted by adverse economic conditions 
our credit risk management practices have enabled us to have low npas and tdrs throughout our history 
however  even by our standards  npas and tdrs have been unusually low in recent years 
although we believe that our lending practices have historically been the primary contributor to our low npas and tdrs  the sustained period of low interest rates and rapid home price appreciation during the past several years contributed to the low level of npas and tdrs 
it is unlikely that such historically low levels of npas and tdrs will continue indefinitely 
the following table sets forth the components of our npas and tdrs and the various ratios to total assets at december    and table nonperforming assets and troubled debt restructured dollars in thousands december nonaccrual loans foreclosed real estate total nonperforming assets tdrs ratio of npas to total assets ratio of tdrs to total assets ratio of npas and tdrs to total assets

the low balance of total npas at december  as compared to the previous two years reflected the impact of the improved economy and the continued strong housing market 
we attribute the relatively high level of npas in texas to economic difficulties in the state over the past several years 
although economic conditions may be improving in the state  some weakness remains in the residential lending market 
we closely monitor all delinquencies and take appropriate steps to protect our interests 
allowance for loan losses the company provides specific valuation allowances for losses on loans when impaired and a write down on foreclosed real estate when any significant and permanent decline in value is identified 
the company also utilizes a methodology for monitoring and estimating probable loan losses that is based on both the company s historical loss experience in the loan portfolio and factors reflecting current economic conditions 
this approach uses a database that identifies losses on loans and foreclosed real estate from past years to the present  broken down by the age of the loan 
this approach also takes into consideration current trends in economic growth  unemployment  housing market activity  and home prices for the nation and individual geographical regions 
based on the analysis of historical performance  current conditions  and other risks  management estimates a range of loss allowances by type of loan and risk category to cover probable losses in the portfolio 
one to four single family real estate loans are evaluated as a group 
in addition  periodic reviews are made of major multi family and commercial real estate loans and foreclosed real estate 
where indicated  valuation allowances are established or adjusted 
in estimating probable losses  consideration is given to the estimated sales price  cost of refurbishing the security property  payment of delinquent taxes  cost of disposal  and cost of holding the property 
additions to and reductions from the allowances are reflected in current earnings based upon quarterly reviews of the portfolio and the methodology and historical analyses are reviewed quarterly

management of other risks we manage other risks that are common to companies in other industries  including operational  regulatory  and management risk 
operational risk operational risk refers to the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems  human factors  or external events 
these events could result in financial losses and other negative consequences  including reputational harm 
we mitigate operational risk in a variety of ways  including the following we promote a corporate culture focused on high ethical conduct  superior customer service  and continual process and productivity improvements  we focus our efforts on a single line of business  our management and board of directors generally have long tenures with the company  giving us the benefit of experience and institutional memory in managing through business cycles and addressing other strategic issues  
table of contents our business managers have the responsibility for adopting and monitoring appropriate controls for their business units  both under long standing banking regulations and section of the sarbanes oxley act  we have maintained an internal audit department for decades that regularly audits our business  including operational controls and information security  the internal audit department reports directly to the audit committee of the board of directors  all of the members of which are independent directors under the new york stock exchange s corporate governance standards  we maintain strong relationships and open dialogue with our regulators  who regularly conduct evaluations of our operations and controls  our management has regular discussions with rating agencies that routinely evaluate our creditworthiness  our business managers and other employees  as well as internal and external legal counsel and auditors  understand they are expected to communicate any material issues not otherwise properly addressed promptly to senior management and  if appropriate  the board of directors or a committee thereof  we monitor the strength and reputations of our counterparties  we perform as many of the business functions and operations internally as economically feasible to retain control of our operations  we have and enforce codes of conduct and ethics for employees  officers  and directors  and we have insurance and contingency plans in place in case of enterprise wide business interruption 
although these actions cannot fully protect us from all operational risks  we believe that they do help protect us from many adverse events and also reduce the severity of issues that might arise 
regulatory risk by regulatory risk  we mean the risk that laws or regulations could change in a manner that adversely affects our business 
this is a risk that is largely outside our control  although we participate in and monitor legal  regulatory  and judicial developments that could impact our business 
among the issues that have received attention recently include state laws and regulations that impact lending  deposit  and mutual fund activities  rules that affect the amount of regulatory capital that banks and other types of financial institutions are required to maintain  changes to the regulation of the housing government sponsored enterprises  including the federal home loan banks  and federal and state privacy laws and regulations that impact how customer information can be used 
we continue to work with policymakers  trade groups  and others to try to ensure that any legal or regulatory developments reflect sound public policy and do not uniquely and adversely affect us 

table of contents management risk management risk is mitigated by having well trained and experienced employees in key positions who can assume management roles in both the immediate and longer term future 
in addition  senior management meets at least twice a year with the board of directors in executive sessions to discuss recommendations and evaluations of potential successors to key members of management  along with a review of any development plans that are recommended for such individuals 
results of operations the following table summarizes selected income statement results for   and table selected financial results dollars in millions year ended december interest income interest expense net interest income provision for loan losses noninterest income general and administrative expenses taxes on income net earnings average earning assets average primary spread net interest income the largest component of our revenue and earnings is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest and dividends earned on loans and other investments and the interest paid on customer deposits and borrowings 
long term growth of our net interest income  and hence earnings  is related to the ability to expand the mortgage portfolio  our primary earning asset  by originating and retaining high quality adjustable rate home loans 
in the short term  however  net interest income can be influenced by business conditions  especially movements in short term interest rates  which can temporarily affect the level of net interest income 
the increase in net interest income in compared with the prior year resulted primarily from the growth in the loan portfolio  our principal earning asset 
between december  and december   our earning asset balance increased by billion or 
this growth resulted from strong mortgage originations which more than offset loan repayments and loan sales 
partially offsetting the benefit to net interest income of a larger average earning asset balance in was a decrease in our average primary spread  which is the monthly average of the monthend difference between the yield on loans and other investments and the rate paid on deposits and borrowings 
the primary spread is discussed previously under asset liability management 
the increase in net interest income in as compared to resulted from the expansion of our earning assets which was partially offset by a modest decrease in our average primary spread

taxes on income we utilize the accrual method of accounting for income tax purposes 
taxes as a percentage of earnings were   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
from quarter to quarter  the effective tax rate may fluctuate due to various state tax matters  particularly changes in the volume of business activity in the various states in which we operate 
liquidity and capital management liquidity management the objective of our liquidity management is to ensure we have sufficient liquid resources to meet all our obligations in a timely and cost effective manner under both normal operational conditions and periods of market stress 
we monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis so that we have sufficient funds available to meet operating requirements  including supporting our lending and deposit activities and replacing maturing obligations 
we also review our liquidity profile on a regular basis to ensure that the capital needs of golden west and its bank subsidiaries are met and that we can maintain strong credit ratings 
the creation and maintenance of collateral is an important component of our liquidity management 
loans  securitized loans  and to a much smaller extent purchased mbs are available to be used as collateral for borrowings 
our objective is to maintain a sufficient supply and variety of collateral so that we have the flexibility to access different secured borrowings at any time 
we regularly test ourselves against various scenarios to confirm that we would have more than sufficient collateral to meet borrowing needs under both current and adverse market conditions the principal sources of funds for golden west at the holding company level are dividends from subsidiaries  interest on investments  and the proceeds from the issuance of debt securities 
various statutory and regulatory restrictions and tax considerations limit the amount of dividends wsb can distribute to gdw 
the principal liquidity needs of golden west are for the payment of interest and principal on debt securities  capital contributions to its insured bank subsidiary  dividends to stockholders  the repurchase of golden west stock  and general and administrative expenses 

table of contents wsb s principal sources of funds are cash flows generated from loan repayments  deposits  borrowings from the fhlb of san francisco  borrowings from its wtx subsidiary  bank notes  debt collateralized by mortgages  mbs  or securities  sales of loans  earnings  and borrowings from golden west 
in addition  wsb has other alternatives available to provide liquidity or finance operations including wholesale certificates of deposit  federal funds purchased  and additional borrowings from private and public offerings of debt 
furthermore  under certain conditions  wsb may borrow from the federal reserve bank of san francisco to meet short term cash needs 
as of december   wsb maintained approximately billion of collateral with the federal reserve bank of san francisco to expedite its ability to borrow from the federal reserve bank if necessary 
capital management strong capital levels are important for the safe and sound operation of a financial institution 
one of our key operating objectives is to maintain a strong capital position to support growth of our loan portfolio and provide substantial operating flexibility 
also  capital invested in earning assets enhances profit 
maintaining strong capital reserves also allows our bank subsidiaries to meet and exceed regulatory capital requirements and contributes to favorable credit ratings 
as of december   wsb  our primary subsidiary  had credit ratings of aa and aa  respectively  from moody s investors service and standard poor s  the nation s two leading credit evaluation agencies 
stockholders equity our stockholders equity amounted to billion  billion  and billion for the years ended december    and  respectively 
all of our stockholders equity is tangible common equity 
stockholders equity increased by billion during as a result of net earnings and increased market values of securities available for sale partially offset by the payment of quarterly dividends to stockholders 
stockholders equity increased by million during as a result of earnings partially offset by the million cost of the repurchase of company stock  the payment of quarterly dividends to stockholders  and the decreased market values of securities available for sale 
uses of capital as in prior years  we retained most of our earnings in the growth in our net worth allowed us to support the substantial growth in our loan portfolio 
expanding the balance of our loans receivable is the first priority for use of our capital  because these earning assets generate the net interest income that is our largest source of revenue 
even with high asset growth of  our stockholders equity to asset ratio was at december  we did not repurchase any shares of golden west common stock in as of december    shares remained available for purchase under the stock purchase program that our board of directors has authorized 
since october  million shares have been repurchased under the stock repurchase program and retired at a cost of billion 
earnings from wsb are expected to continue to be the major source of funding for the stock repurchase program 
the repurchase of golden west stock is not intended to have a material impact on the normal liquidity of the company 
on december   a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend was paid to the holders of record of golden west s common stock at the close of business on november  the stock dividend was approved by the board of directors on october  on that date  the board of directors also approved a increase in golden west s cash dividend 

table of contents regulatory capital our bank subsidiaries  wsb and wtx  are subject to capital requirements described in detail in note a to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the most recent notification from the office of thrift supervision categorized wsb and wtx as well capitalized  the highest capital tier established by the ots and other bank regulatory agencies 
there are no conditions or events that have occurred since that notification that we believe would have an impact on the well capitalized categorization of wsb or wtx 
these high capital levels qualify our bank subsidiaries for the minimum federal deposit insurance rates and enable our subsidiaries to minimize time consuming and expensive regulatory burdens 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations all subsidiaries of golden west are owned and are included in our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements like other mortgage lenders and in the ordinary course of our business  we enter into agreements to lend to a customer provided that the customer satisfies the terms of the contract 
loan commitments have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
prior to entering each commitment  we evaluate the customer s creditworthiness and the value of the property 
the amount of outstanding loan commitments at december  was billion 
the vast majority of these commitments were for adjustable rate mortgages 
in the ordinary course of business  we borrow from the fhlbs 
at december   we had billion and million of commitments outstanding for advances from the fhlb of dallas and the fhlb of san francisco  respectively 
these advances will be indexed to one month libor 
contractual obligations we enter into contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business  including debt issuances for the funding of operations and leases for premises

table of contents critical accounting policies and uses of estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events  including interest rate levels and repayments rates 
these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions because of changes in the business environment 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note a to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management reviews and approves our significant accounting policies on a quarterly basis and discusses them with the audit committee at least annually 
we believe that the policy regarding the determination of our allowance for loan losses is our most critical accounting policy as it has a material impact on our financial statements and requires management s most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
the allowance for loan losses reflects management s estimates of the probable credit losses inherent in our loans receivable balance 
the allowance for loan losses  and the resulting provision for loan losses  is based on judgments and assumptions about many external factors  including current trends in economic growth  unemployment  housing market activity  home price appreciation  and the level of mortgage turnover 
additions to and reductions from the allowance are recognized in current earnings based upon management s quarterly reviews 
a further discussion can be found in management of credit risk allowance for loan losses
