we intend to continue to drive our strategy of streamlining business processes through the use of information technologies so that we can continue to offer our customers a comprehensive solution to improve their communications and relationships across their supply chain and be more responsive to market demands 
pursue strategic opportunities 
we have actively pursued acquisitions of manufacturing facilities  design and engineering resources and technologies in order to expand our worldwide operations  broaden our service offerings  diversify and strengthen our customer relationships  and enhance our competitive position as a leading provider of comprehensive outsourcing solutions 
we will continue to selectively pursue strategic opportunities that we believe will further our business objectives and enhance shareholder value 
focus on core activities 
as part of our strategy  we continuously evaluate the strategic and financial contributions of each of our operations and focus our primary growth objectives on our core ems vertically integrated business activities 
we also assess opportunities to maximize shareholder value with respect to our non core activities through divestitures  initial public offerings  spin offs and other strategic transactions 
consistent with this strategy  we entered into an agreement in principle to merge our flextronics network services business with telavie as  a company wholly owned by altor  a private equity firm focusing on investments in the nordic region 
under the terms of the proposed merger  we would receive an 
table of contents undisclosed cash payment plus additional contingent payments along with ownership of of the merged company 
customers our customers include many of the world s leading technology companies 
we have focused on establishing long term relationships with our customers and have been successful in expanding our relationships to incorporate additional product lines and services 
in fiscal year  our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of net sales 
our largest customers during fiscal year were sony ericsson and hewlett packard  accounting for approximately and of net sales  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of net sales in fiscal year the following table lists in alphabetical order a representative sample of our largest customers in fiscal year and the products of those customers for which we provide ems services customer end products alcatel sa cellular phones  accessories and telecommunications infrastructure casio computer co  ltd

backlog although we obtain firm purchase orders from our customers  oem customers typically do not make firm orders for delivery of products more than to days in advance 
in addition  oem customers may reschedule or cancel firm orders 
therefore  we do not believe that the backlog of expected product sales covered by firm purchase orders is a meaningful measure of future sales 
competition the ems industry is extremely competitive and includes many companies  several of which have achieved substantial market share 
we compete against numerous domestic and foreign ems providers  as well as our current and prospective customers  who evaluate our capabilities in light of their own 
we also face competition from taiwanese odm suppliers  which have a substantial share of the global market for information technology hardware production  primarily related to notebook and desktop computers and 
table of contents personal computer motherboards  and which manufacture consumer products and provide other technology manufacturing services 
we compete with different companies depending on the type of service we are providing or the geographic area in which an activity is taking place 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the segments of the ems industry in which we operate are quality and range of services  design and technological capabilities  cost  location of facilities  and responsiveness and flexibility 
social responsibility our corporate social responsibility practices are broad in scope  and include a focus on disaster relief  medical aid  education  environmental protection  health and safety and the support of communities around the world 
we intend to continue to invest in global communities through grant making  financial contributions  volunteer work  support programs and donating resources 
our commitment to social responsibility also includes our mission to positively contribute to global communities and the environment by adhering to the highest ethical standards of practice with our customers  suppliers  partners  employees  communities and investors as well as with respect to our corporate governance policies and procedures  and by providing a safe and quality work environment for our employees 
employees as of march   our global workforce totaled approximately  employees 
we have never experienced a significant work stoppage or strike  and we believe that our employee relations are good 
our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of key managerial and technical employees 
the loss of such personnel could seriously harm our business  results of operations and business prospects 
to date  we have not experienced significant difficulties in attracting or retaining such personnel 
although we are not aware that any of our key personnel currently intend to terminate their employment  we cannot guarantee their future services 
environmental regulation our operations are subject to a number of regulatory requirements relating to the use  storage  discharge  and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during the manufacturing processes 
we believe that our operations are currently in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations and we do not believe that costs of compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  operating results  or competitive position 
in addition  we are responsible for cleanup of contamination at some of our current and former manufacturing facilities and at some third party sites 
in the past  we have engaged an environmental consulting firm to assist us in the evaluation of environmental liabilities of our ongoing operations  historical disposal activities and closed sites in order to establish appropriate accruals in our financial statements 
we determined the amount of our accruals for environmental matters by analyzing and estimating the range of possible costs in light of information currently available 
the imposition of more stringent standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations  the results of future testing and analysis undertaken by us at our operating facilities  or a determination that we are potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at other sites could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters 
while no material exposures have been identified to date that we are aware of  there can be no assurance that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future or that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites as to which no problem is currently known 
we are also required to comply with certain hazardous substance content regulations such as the european union s directive ec about rohs 
some of our customers require that we take responsibility for the risk of non compliance for both the components that we procure and our own products that we supply for those customers products 
to address this risk  we require that component suppliers comply with relevant hazardous substance product content regulations and we engage in other standard mitigating 
table of contents activities 
if we or our suppliers do not comply with these regulations  we could incur significant costs and or penalties relating to noncompliance 
intellectual property we own or have licensed various united states and foreign patents related to a variety of technologies 
for certain of our proprietary processes  we rely on trade secret protection 
we also have registered our corporate name and several other trademarks and service marks that we use in our business in the united states and other countries throughout the world 
although we believe that our intellectual property assets and licenses are sufficient for the operation of our business as we currently conduct it  we cannot assure you that third parties will not make infringement claims against us in the future 
in addition  we are increasingly providing design and engineering to our customers and designing and making our own products 
as a consequence of these activities  we are required to address and allocate the ownership and responsibility for intellectual property in our customer relationships to a greater extent than in our manufacturing and assembly businesses 
if a third party were to make an assertion regarding the ownership or right to use intellectual property  we could be required to either enter into licensing arrangements or to resolve the issue through litigation 
such license rights may not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms  if at all  or any such litigation may not be resolved in our favor 
additionally  litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially harm our financial condition regardless of the outcome 
we may also be required to incur substantial costs to redesign a product or re perform design services

we were incorporated in the republic of singapore in may our principal corporate office is located at one marina boulevard   singapore our us corporate headquarters is located at fortune drive  san jose  california  risk factors we depend on industries that continually produce technologically advanced products with short life cycles  our inability to continually manufacture such products on a cost effective basis could harm our business 
we derive our revenues from the following industries handheld devices  with products such as cellular phones and personal digital assistants  computer and office automation  with products such as copiers  scanners  graphics cards  desktop and notebook computers  and peripheral devices such as printers and projectors  communications infrastructure  with products such as equipment for optical networks  wireless base stations  access edge routers and switches  and broadband access equipment  consumer devices  with products such as set top boxes  home entertainment equipment  cameras and home appliances  information technology infrastructure  with products such as servers  workstations  storage systems  mainframes  hubs and routers  and a variety of other industries  including the industrial  automotive and medical industries 

table of contents factors affecting any of these industries in general  or our customers in particular  could seriously harm us 
these factors include rapid changes in technology  evolving industry standards and requirements for continuous improvement in products and services  result in short product life cycles  demand for our customers products may be seasonal  our customers may fail to successfully market their products  and our customers products may fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance  and there may be recessionary periods in our customers markets 
our customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or locations  or delay production 
as a provider of electronics manufacturing services  we must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround time for our customers 
we generally do not obtain firm  long term purchase commitments from our customers  and we often experience reduced lead times in customer orders 
customers cancel their orders  change production quantities and delay production for a number of reasons 
uncertain economic and geopolitical conditions have resulted  and may continue to result  in some of our customers delaying the delivery of some of the products we manufacture for them  and placing purchase orders for lower volumes of products than previously anticipated 
cancellations  reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers have harmed  and may continue to harm  our results of operations by reducing the volumes of products we manufacture and deliver for these customers  by causing a delay in the repayment of our expenditures for inventory in preparation for customer orders and by lowering our asset utilization resulting in lower gross margins 
in addition  customers often require that manufacturing of their products be transitioned from one facility to another to achieve cost and other objectives 
such transfers result in inefficiencies and costs due to resulting excess capacity and overhead at one facility and capacity constraints and related stresses at the other 
in addition  we make significant decisions  including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept  production schedules  component procurement commitments  personnel and other resource requirements  based on our estimates of customer requirements 
the short term nature of our customers commitments and the rapid changes in demand for their products reduces our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of those customers 
this makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity 
on occasion  customers require rapid increases in production  which stress our resources and reduce our margins 
although we have increased our manufacturing capacity  and plan further increases  we may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers demands 
in addition  because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed  a reduction in customer demand harms our gross profit and operating income 
our operating results vary significantly from period to period 
we experience significant fluctuations in our results of operations 
some of the principal factors that contribute to the fluctuations in our annual and quarterly operating results are adverse changes in general economic conditions  changes in demand for our services  our effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes and costs in order to decrease manufacturing expenses  the mix of the types of manufacturing services we provide  as high volume and low complexity manufacturing services typically have lower gross margins than lower volume and more complex services  
table of contents changes in the cost and availability of labor and components  which often occur in the electronics manufacturing industry and which affect our margins and our ability to meet delivery schedules  the degree to which we are able to utilize our available manufacturing capacity  our ability to manage the timing of our component purchases so that components are available when needed for production  while avoiding the risks of purchasing inventory in excess of immediate production needs  local conditions and events that may affect our production volumes  such as labor conditions  political instability and local holidays  and changes in demand in our customers end markets 
two of our significant end markets are the handheld electronics devices market and the consumer devices market 
these markets exhibit particular strength toward the end of the calendar year in connection with the holiday season 
as a result  we have historically experienced stronger revenues in our third fiscal quarter as compared to our other fiscal quarters 
we may encounter difficulties with acquisitions  which could harm our business 
we have completed numerous acquisitions of businesses and we expect to continue to acquire additional businesses in the future 
we are currently in preliminary discussions with respect to potential acquisitions and strategic customer transactions  and we are in the process of completing the acquisition of nortel s optical  and wireless and enterprise manufacturing operations and related supply chain activities  as described in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
we do not have any other definitive agreements to make any material acquisitions or strategic customer transactions 
any future acquisitions may require additional debt or equity financing 
this could increase our leverage or be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
we may not be able to complete acquisitions or strategic customer transactions in the future to the same extent as in the past  or at all 
to integrate acquired businesses  we must implement our management information systems and operating systems and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations 
the difficulties of this integration may be further complicated by geographic distances 
the integration of acquired businesses may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges  including difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and operations  diversion of management s attention from the normal operation of our business  potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies  which is a particular concern in the acquisition of companies engaged in product and software design  difficulties managing and integrating operations in geographically dispersed locations  lack of experience operating in the geographic market or industry sector of the acquired business  the risk of deficiencies in internal controls at acquired companies  increases in our expenses and working capital requirements  which reduce our return on invested capital  and exposure to unanticipated liabilities of acquired companies 
these and other factors have harmed  and in the future could harm  our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition  and could adversely affect our business and operating results 

table of contents our new strategic relationship with nortel involves a number of risks  and we may not succeed in realizing the anticipated benefits of this relationship 
the transaction with nortel described in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview is subject to a number of closing conditions  including regulatory approvals  conversion of information technology systems  and the completion of the required information and consultation process with employee representatives in europe 
some of the processes involved in converting information technology systems including the integration of related systems and internal controls are complex and time consuming  and may present unanticipated difficulties 
as a result  we currently expect that this transaction will not be completed before the march quarter 
further delays may arise if the conversion of information technology systems requires more time than presently anticipated 
in addition  completion of the required information and consultation process with employee representatives in europe may result in additional delays and in difficulties in retaining employees 
after closing  the success of this transaction will depend on our ability to successfully integrate the acquired operations with our existing operations 
this will involve integrating nortel s operations into our existing procurement activities  and assimilating and managing existing personnel 
in addition  this transaction will increase our expenses and working capital requirements  and place burdens on our management resources 
in the event we are unsuccessful in integrating the acquired operations  we would not achieve the anticipated benefits of this transaction  and our results of operations would be adversely affected 
as a result of the new strategic relationship  we expect that nortel will become our largest single customer  and will represent over of our net sales 
the manufacturing relationship with nortel is not exclusive  and they are entitled to use other suppliers for a portion of their requirements of these products 
although nortel has agreed to use us to manufacture a majority of its requirements for these existing products  for so long as our services are competitive  our services may not remain competitive  and there can be no assurance that we will continue to manufacture a majority of nortel s requirements for these products 
in addition  sales of these products depend on a number of factors  including global economic conditions  competition  new technologies that could render these products obsolete  the level of sales and marketing resources devoted by nortel with respect to these products  and the success of these sales and marketing activities 
if demand for these products should decline  we would experience reduced sales and gross margins from these products 
we have agreed to cost reduction targets and price limitations and to certain manufacturing quality requirements 
we may not be able to reduce costs over time as required  and nortel would be entitled to certain reductions in their product prices  which would adversely affect our margins from this program 
in addition  we may encounter difficulties in meeting nortel s expectations as to product quality and timeliness 
if nortel s requirements exceed the volume we anticipate  we may be unable to meet these requirements on a timely basis 
our inability to meet nortel s volume  quality  timeliness and cost requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
additionally  nortel may not purchase a sufficient quantity of products from us to meet our expectations and we may not utilize a sufficient portion of the acquired capacity to achieve profitable operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we completed the closing of the acquisition of nortel s optical design operations in november  and as a result we employ approximately of nortel s former optical design employees 
in addition  in february  we also completed the closing of the manufacturing operations and related assets including product integration  testing  repair and logistics operations in montreal  quebec  canada 
we may fail to retain and motivate these employees or to successfully integrate them into our operations 
although we expect that our gross margin and operating margin on sales to nortel will initially be less than that generally realized by the company in fiscal  we also expect that we will be able to increase these gross margins over time through cost reductions and by internally sourcing our vertically integrated supply chain solutions  which include the fabrication and assembly of printed circuit boards and enclosures  as well as logistics and repair services 
additionally  the impact of lower gross margins may be partially offset by 
table of contents the effect of anticipated lower selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales 
there can be no assurance that we will realize lower expenses or increased operating efficiencies as anticipated 
our strategic relationships with major customers create risks 
over the past several years  we have completed numerous strategic transactions with oem customers  including  among others  alcatel  casio  ericsson and xerox  and we are currently in the process of completing a strategic transaction with nortel 
under these arrangements  we generally acquire inventory  equipment and other assets from the oem  and lease or acquire their manufacturing facilities  while simultaneously entering into multi year supply agreements for the production of their products 
we intend to continue to pursue these oem divestiture transactions in the future 
there is strong competition among ems companies for these transactions  and this competition may increase 
these transactions have contributed to a significant portion of our revenue growth  and if we fail to complete similar transactions in the future  our revenue growth could be harmed 
the arrangements entered into with divesting oems typically involve many risks  including the following we may need to pay a purchase price to the divesting oems that exceeds the value we may realize from the future business of the oem  the integration of the acquired assets and facilities into our business may be time consuming and costly  we  rather than the divesting oem  bear the risk of excess capacity at the facility  we may not achieve anticipated cost reductions and efficiencies at the facility  we may be unable to meet the expectations of the oem as to volume  product quality  timeliness and cost reductions  our supply agreements with the oems generally do not require any minimum volumes of purchase by the oems  and the actual volume of purchases may be less than anticipated  and if demand for the oems products declines  the oem may reduce its volume of purchases  and we may not be able to sufficiently reduce the expenses of operating the facility or use the facility to provide services to other oems 
as a result of these and other risks  we have been  and in the future may be  unable to achieve anticipated levels of profitability under these arrangements 
in addition  these strategic arrangements have not  and in the future may not  result in any material revenues or contribute positively to our earnings per share 
if we do not effectively manage changes in our operations  our business may be harmed 
we have experienced growth in our business through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions  and we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future  including our pending completion of the acquisition of assets from nortel described in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
our global workforce has more than doubled in size since the beginning of fiscal year during that time  we have also reduced our workforce at some locations and closed certain facilities in connection with our restructuring activities 
these changes have placed considerable strain on our management control systems and resources  including decision support  accounting management  information systems and facilities 
if we do not continue to improve our financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures to manage our employees effectively and to expand our facilities  our business could be harmed 
we plan to continue to transition manufacturing to lower cost locations and we may be required to take additional restructuring charges in the future as a result of these activities 
we also intend to increase our 
table of contents manufacturing capacity in our low cost regions by expanding our facilities and adding new equipment 
acquisitions and expansions involve significant risks  including  but not limited to  the following we may not be able to attract and retain the management personnel and skilled employees necessary to support newly acquired or expanded operations  we may not efficiently and effectively integrate new operations and information systems  expand our existing operations and manage geographically dispersed operations  we may incur cost overruns  we may incur charges related to our expansion activities  we may encounter construction delays  equipment delays or shortages  labor shortages and disputes and production start up problems that could harm our growth and our ability to meet customers delivery schedules  and we may not be able to obtain funds for acquisitions and expansions on attractive terms  and we may not be able to obtain loans or operating leases with attractive terms 
in addition  we expect to incur new fixed operating expenses associated with our expansion efforts that will increase our cost of sales  including increases in depreciation expense and rental expense 
if our revenues do not increase sufficiently to offset these expenses  our operating results could be seriously harmed 
our transition to low cost manufacturing regions has contributed to significant restructuring and other charges that have resulted from reducing our workforce and capacity at higher cost locations 
we recognized restructuring charges of approximately million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  associated with the consolidation and closure of several manufacturing facilities  and related impairment of certain long lived assets 
we expect to recognize approximately million of restructuring charges in fiscal and we may be required to take additional charges in the future as a result of these activities 
we cannot assure you as to the timing or amount of any future restructuring charges 
if we are required to take additional restructuring charges in the future  it could have a material adverse impact on operating results  financial position and cash flows 
our increased design services offering may reduce our profitability 
as part of our strategy to enhance our vertically integrated end to end service offerings  we are actively pursuing the expansion of our design and engineering capabilities  which requires that we make investments in research and development  technology licensing  test and tooling equipment  patent applications  facility expansion  and recruitment 
although we enter into contracts with our design services customers  we may design and develop products for these customers prior to receiving a purchase order or other firm commitment from them 
we are required to make substantial investments in the resources necessary to design and develop these products  and no revenue may be generated from these efforts if our customers do not approve the designs in a timely manner or at all  or if they do not then purchase anticipated levels of products 
certain of the products we design and develop must satisfy safety and regulatory standards and some must receive government certifications 
if we fail to obtain these approvals or certifications on a timely basis  we would be unable to sell these products  which would harm our sales  profitability and reputation 
in addition  design activities often require that we purchase inventory for initial production runs before we have a purchase commitment from a customer 
even after we have a contract with a customer with respect to a product  these contracts may allow the customer to delay or cancel deliveries and may not obligate the customer to any volume of purchases 
these contracts can generally be terminated by either party on short notice 
due to the increased risks associated with our design services offerings  we may not be able to achieve a high enough level of sales for this business to be profitable 
due to the initial costs of investing in the resources necessary to expand our design and engineering capabilities  and in particular to support our odm services offerings  our profitability during fiscal years and was adversely affected 
we continue to make investments in these capabilities  which could adversely affect our profitability during fiscal year and beyond 

table of contents intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business 
our design services involve the creation and use of intellectual property rights  which subject us to the risk of claims of intellectual property infringement from third parties  as well as claims arising from the allocation of intellectual property rights among us and our design services customers 
in addition  customers for our odm and components design services typically require that we indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement 
if any claims are brought against us or our customers for such infringement  whether or not these have merit  we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of such claims 
in the event of such an infringement claim  we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non infringing alternatives or obtain licenses 
we may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining such a license on reasonable terms or at all 
the success of certain of our design activities depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 
we retain certain intellectual property rights to certain technologies that we develop as part of our engineering and design activities 
as the level of our engineering and design activities is increasing  the extent to which we rely on rights to intellectual property incorporated into products is increasing 
despite our efforts  we cannot be certain that the measures we have taken to prevent unauthorized use of our technology will be successful 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  this could reduce or eliminate the competitive advantages of our proprietary technology  which would harm our business 
if our odm products or components are subject to design defects  our business may be damaged and we may incur significant fees and costs 
a defect in a design could result in product or component failures or a product liability claim 
in our contracts with our odm products or components customers we generally provide a warranty against defects in our designs 
since we provide this warranty to these customers we are exposed to an increased risk of warranty claims 
if we design a product or component that is found to have a design defect  we could spend a significant amount of money to resolve these design warranty claims 
we may also incur considerable costs in connection with product liability claims that may arise as a result of our design and engineering activities 
we have limited product liability insurance coverage  however it is expensive and may not be available with respect to all of our design services offerings on acceptable terms  in sufficient amounts  or at all 
a successful product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage or any material claim for which insurance coverage is denied or limited or is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are exposed to intangible asset risk 
we have a substantial amount of intangible assets 
these intangible assets are attributable to acquisitions and represent the difference between the purchase price paid for the acquired businesses and the fair value of the net tangible assets of the acquired businesses 
we are required to evaluate goodwill and other intangibles for impairment on at least an annual basis  and whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows 
as a result of our annual and other periodic evaluations  we may determine that the intangible asset values need to be written down to their fair values  which could result in material charges that could be adverse to our operating results and financial position 
we depend on the continuing trend of outsourcing by oems 
future growth in our revenues depends on new outsourcing opportunities in which we assume additional manufacturing and supply chain management responsibilities from oems 
to the extent that these opportunities are not available  either because oems decide to perform these functions internally or because they use other providers of these services  our future growth would be limited 

table of contents the majority of our sales come from a small number of customers  if we lose any of these customers  our sales could decline significantly 
sales to our ten largest customers represent a significant percentage of our net sales 
our ten largest customers accounted for approximately and of net sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
our largest customers during fiscal year were sony ericsson and hewlett packard  which accounted for approximately and of net sales  respectively 
hewlett packard and sony ericsson each accounted for approximately of net sales in fiscal no other customer accounted for more than of net sales in fiscal year or fiscal year our principal customers have varied from year to year  and our principal customers may not continue to purchase services from us at current levels  if at all 
significant reductions in sales to any of these customers  or the loss of major customers  would seriously harm our business 
if we are not able to timely replace expired  canceled or reduced contracts with new business  our revenues could be harmed 
our industry is extremely competitive 
the ems industry is extremely competitive and includes many companies  several of which have achieved substantial market share 
current and prospective customers also evaluate our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products themselves 
some of our competitors may have greater design  manufacturing  financial or other resources than we do 
additionally  we face competition from taiwanese odm suppliers  which have a substantial share of the global market for information technology hardware production  primarily related to notebook and desktop computers and personal computer motherboards  and which manufacture consumer products and provide other technology manufacturing services 
the overall demand for electronics manufacturing services decreased in recent years  resulting in increased capacity and substantial pricing pressures  which have harmed our operating results 
certain sectors of the ems industry have experienced increased price competition  and if we experience such increased level of competition in the future  our revenues and gross margin may continue to be adversely affected 
we may be adversely affected by shortages of required electronic components 
at various times  there have been shortages of some of the electronic components that we use  as a result of strong demand for those components or problems experienced by suppliers 
these unanticipated component shortages have resulted in curtailed production or delays in production  which prevented us from making scheduled shipments to customers in the past and may do so in the future 
our inability to make scheduled shipments could cause the company to experience a reduction in sales  increase in inventory levels and costs  and could adversely affect relationships with existing and prospective customers 
component shortages may also increase our cost of goods sold because we may be required to pay higher prices for components in short supply and redesign or reconfigure products to accommodate substitute components 
as a result  component shortages could adversely affect our operating results for a particular period due to the resulting revenue shortfall and increased manufacturing or component costs 
we are subject to the risk of increased income taxes 
we have structured our operations in a manner designed to maximize income in countries where tax incentives have been extended to encourage foreign investment  or income tax rates are low 
we base our tax position upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities 
however  our tax position is subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law  which may have retroactive effect 
we cannot determine in advance the extent to which some jurisdictions may require us to pay taxes or make payments in lieu of taxes 

table of contents several countries in which we are located allow for tax holidays or provide other tax incentives to attract and retain business 
these tax incentives expire over various periods from to and are subject to certain conditions with which we expect to comply 
we have obtained tax holidays or other incentives where available  primarily in china  malaysia and hungary 
in these three countries  we generated an aggregate of approximately billion of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended march  our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are not renewed upon expiration  or tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased 
in addition  further acquisitions or divestitures may cause our effective tax rate to increase 
we conduct operations in a number of countries and are subject to risks of international operations 
the geographical distances between the americas  asia and europe create a number of logistical and communications challenges for the company 
these challenges include managing operations across multiple time zones  directing the manufacture and delivery of products across distances  coordinating procurement of components and raw materials and their delivery to multiple locations  and coordinating the activities and decisions of the core management team  which is based in a number of different countries 
facilities in several different locations may be involved at different stages of the production of a single product  leading to additional logistical difficulties 
because our manufacturing operations are located in a number of countries throughout the americas  asia and europe  we are subject to the risks of changes in economic and political conditions in those countries  including fluctuations in the value of local currencies  labor unrest and difficulties in staffing  longer payment cycles  cultural differences  increases in duties and taxation levied on our products  imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds  limitations on imports or exports of components or assembled products  or other travel restrictions  expropriation of private enterprises  and a potential reversal of current favorable policies encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade by our host countries 
the attractiveness of our services to us customers can be affected by changes in us trade policies  such as most favored nation status and trade preferences for some asian countries 
in addition  some countries in which we operate  such as brazil  hungary  mexico  malaysia and poland  have experienced periods of slow or negative growth  high inflation  significant currency devaluations or limited availability of foreign exchange 
furthermore  in countries such as china and mexico  governmental authorities exercise significant influence over many aspects of the economy  and their actions could have a significant effect on us 
finally  we could be seriously harmed by inadequate infrastructure  including lack of adequate power and water supplies  transportation  raw materials and parts in countries in which we operate 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could increase our operating costs 
our manufacturing operations and industrial parks are located in lower cost regions of the world  such as asia  eastern europe and mexico  however  most of our purchase and sale transactions are denominated in united states dollars or euros 
as a result  we are exposed to fluctuations in the functional currencies of our fixed cost overhead or our supply base relative to the currencies in which we conduct transactions 
currency exchange rates fluctuate on a daily basis as a result of a number of factors  including changes in a country s political and economic policies 
volatility in the functional currencies of our entities and the euro 
table of contents or united states dollar could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
the primary impact of currency exchange fluctuations is on our cash  receivables  and payables of our operating entities 
as part of our currency hedging strategy  we use financial instruments  primarily forward purchase contracts  to hedge united states dollar and other currency commitments in order to reduce the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on current assets and liabilities 
additionally  we manage our foreign currency exposure by borrowing money in various foreign currencies 
if our hedging activities are not successful or if we change or reduce these hedging activities in the future  we may experience significant unexpected expenses from fluctuations in exchange rates 
we are also exposed to the risk that china may revalue its currency relative to other foreign currencies 
the chinese currency is the renminbi yuan rmb 
the chinese government is under global international pressure to relax its control over the exchange rate of the rmb relative to the united states dollar and instead to let the value of the rmb float either free or within a band against the united stated dollar 
it is generally understood that the effect of the chinese government s control of the rmb exchange rate has been to undervalue the rmb 
there is no certainty as to whether the chinese government will elect to revalue the rmb in the near future  or at all 
in addition  the chinese government has not disclosed the magnitude of any revaluation it may be considering 
a significant increase in the value of the rmb could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows by increasing both our manufacturing costs and the costs of our local supply base 
we depend on our executive officers and skilled management personnel 
our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive officers 
generally our employees are not bound by employment or non competition agreements  and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive officers and other key employees 
we could be seriously harmed by the loss of any of our executive officers 
in order to manage our growth  we will need to recruit and retain additional skilled management personnel and if we are not able to do so  our business and our ability to continue to grow could be harmed 
in addition  in connection with expanding our design services offerings  we must attract and retain experienced design engineers 
although we and a number of companies in our industry have implemented workforce reductions  there remains substantial competition for highly skilled employees 
our failure to recruit and retain experienced design engineers could limit the growth of our design services offerings  which could adversely affect our business 
we are subject to environmental compliance risks 
we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  including hazardous substance product content regulations  and regulations governing the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous substances in the ordinary course of our manufacturing process 
we are exposed to liabilities related to hazardous substance content regulations as some customers are requiring that we take responsibility for the risk of non compliance for the components that we procure for those customers products 
to address this risk  we require that component suppliers comply with relevant hazardous substance product content regulations and we engage in other standard mitigating activities 
however  these efforts may be unsuccessful and we may incur significant liabilities and be required to expend substantial amounts of money on behalf of our customers to enforce or otherwise satisfy the obligations of the component suppliers 
in addition  we are responsible for cleanup of contamination at some of our current and former manufacturing facilities and at some third party sites 
if more stringent compliance or cleanup standards under environmental laws or regulations are imposed  or the results of future testing and analyses at our current or former operating facilities indicate that we are responsible for the release of hazardous substances  we may be subject to additional remediation liability 
further  additional environmental matters may arise in the future at sites where no problem is currently known or at sites that we may acquire in the future 
currently unexpected costs that we may incur with respect to environmental matters may result in additional loss contingencies  the quantification of which cannot be determined at this time 

table of contents the market price of our ordinary shares is volatile 
the stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of technology companies 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies 
the market for our ordinary shares may be subject to similar fluctuations 
factors such as fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations or events affecting other companies in the electronics industry  currency fluctuations and general market conditions may cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline 
it may be difficult for investors to effect services of process within the united states on us or to enforce civil liabilities under the federal securities laws of the united states against us 
we are incorporated in singapore under the companies act  chapter of singapore  or singapore companies act 
some of our officers reside outside the united states 
a substantial portion of the assets of flextronics international ltd 
are located outside the united states 
as a result  it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the united states upon us or to enforce against us in united states courts  judgments obtained in such courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states 
judgments of united states courts based upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states are not directly enforceable in singapore courts and there can be no assurance as to whether singapore courts will enter judgments in original actions brought in singapore courts based solely upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states
