we strive to achieve such growth in our customer base by providing convenient banking options  leading technological systems and a broad range of asset management products and services 
we also intend to grow through appropriate and targeted acquisitions and  in certain businesses  by expanding into new geographical markets 
in recent years  we have managed interest rate risk toward achieving a moderate risk profile with limited exposure to earnings volatility resulting from interest rate fluctuations 
our actions have created a balance sheet characterized by strong asset quality and significant flexibility to take advantage  where appropriate  of rising interest rates 
we anticipate that interest rates will continue to rise in and that the overall impact of a rise in long term interest rates will be beneficial to us 
effective january   our majority owned subsidiary blackrock acquired ssrm holdings  inc ssrm  the holding company for state street research management company and ssr realty advisors inc  from metlife  inc 
at closing  metlife  inc received approximately million in cash and approximately  shares of blackrock restricted class a common stock

we expect that the addition of ssrm will enhance blackrock s investment management platform with additional us equity  alternative investment and real estate equity management capabilities  expanding the universe of products offered to institutional and individual investors worldwide 
on february   we entered into an amended and restated agreement to acquire riggs national corporation riggs  a washington  dc based banking company  replacing the original acquisition agreement entered into july  the transaction will give us a substantial presence on which to build a market leading franchise in the affluent washington metropolitan area 
the total consideration under the amended and restated agreement is comprised of a fixed number of approximately million shares of pnc common stock and million in cash  subject to adjustment 
the merger is subject to closing conditions including  among others  receipt of regulatory approvals and waivers and approval of the riggs shareholders

we include additional information on riggs and ssrm in note acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report and in the risk factors section of item of this report 
key factors affecting financial performance our financial performance is substantially affected by several external factors outside of our control  including general economic conditions  loan demand  interest rates  the shape of the interest rate yield curve  and the performance of the capital markets 
we seek a moderate risk profile in the management of our businesses to limit the risk of loss resulting from quickly changing market conditions 
we focus on the development and management of our customer franchises to generate longer term growth in revenue and earnings 
during  we achieved success in growing our business segments  with customer growth and retention improving in a number of key areas 
we believe such growth enhances our overall value by increasing revenues that are less susceptible to changes in economic and market conditions 
noninterest income increased by in compared with this improvement reflects  among other things  growth in fee based customer revenues 
economic factors  particularly low interest rates  continued to pressure net interest income through the first half of loan demand increased during the second half of the year 
while we expect interest rates to continue to rise and loan demand to continue to increase  we cannot predict the timing and magnitude of these increases with certainty 
to some extent  the benefits of rising interest rates and increases in loan demand will trail these increases 

table of contents in addition to changes in general economic conditions  including the direction  timing and magnitude of movement in interest rates and the performance of the capital markets  our success in will depend  among other things  upon further success in the acquisition  growth and retention of customers  growth in market share across businesses  disciplined expense control and improved efficiency  maintaining strong overall asset quality  prudent risk and capital management  and successful completion of the acquisition and integration of riggs

net interest income gaap reconciliation the interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax 
as such  these tax exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment

provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses was million for compared with million for the significant decline in the provision for credit losses compared with the prior year was primarily due to the overall improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio during this improved credit quality reflected a decline in nonperforming loans since december  and a reduction in problems related to performing credits 
the favorable impact of these factors on the provision was partially offset by the impact of overall loan growth in we expect the provision for credit losses to be higher in as a result of anticipated loan growth

table of contents the fourth quarter benefit of million resulting from the settlement of certain claims related to the pagic transactions  expenses totaling million in connection with the sale of our vehicle leasing business during the second quarter of  and a million impairment charge on an intangible asset related to the orderly liquidation of a particular fund managed by blackrock

the billion increase in total assets at december  compared with december  was primarily driven by the following the impact of our january acquisition of united national  organic growth in total loans  increases in other assets  other short term investments and goodwill  and a larger securities portfolio 
an analysis of changes in selected balance sheet categories follows 
loans  net of unearned income loans increased billion  or  as of december  compared with december  the increase in total loans reflected the following home equity loans increased billion  reflecting organic growth and the purchase of approximately million of home equity loans in early demand for commercial loans grew during the year  reflected in the billion increase in this loan category  and automobile and other consumer loans combined increased 
billion 
the favorable impact of these factors on our loan balances was partially offset by the effect of the sale of the vehicle leasing portfolio in we added billion of loans with the united national acquisition in  as reflected in various loan categories

the loans that we hold are also diversified across the geographic areas where we do business 
as shown in the table below  the types of commercial loans and unfunded commitments in our wholesale banking business remained concentrated in investment grade equivalent exposure and secured lending

cross border leases and related tax matters the equipment lease portfolio totaled billion at december  and included approximately billion of cross border leases 
cross border leases are primarily leveraged leases of equipment located in foreign countries  primarily in western europe and australia 
we no longer enter into new cross border lease transactions 

table of contents aggregate residual value at risk on the total commercial lease portfolio at december  was billion 
we have taken steps to mitigate 
billion of this residual risk  including residual value insurance coverage with third parties  third party guarantees  and other actions 
approximately 
billion of this risk was unmitigated at december  the american jobs creation act of ajca limits the tax deductions that may be taken in a given year related to certain lease transactions  including the types of cross border lease transactions that we have previously entered into 
however  ajca impacts only cross border lease transactions entered into after march  all of our cross border lease transactions were entered into prior to this date and are therefore not affected by ajca 
while only transactions entered into after march  are specifically impacted  ajca is clear that no inference should be drawn as to the proper tax treatment of transactions entered into on or before this date 
thus  the tax treatment of existing transactions is still subject to challenge by the irs 
as part of the audit of our consolidated federal income tax returns  the irs has proposed adjustments to the following cross border lease transactions that we have previously entered into two lease in  lease out transactions  seven qualified technological equipment leases  and three lease to service contract transactions 
the proposed adjustments would reverse the tax treatment of these transactions as we reported them on our filed tax returns 
we believe the method used to report these transactions in our filed tax returns is supported by appropriate tax law and intend to pursue resolution of the matter through the appropriate irs administrative appeal remedies 
while we cannot predict with certainty the result of pursuing the administrative appeal remedies  any resolution would most likely involve a change in the timing of tax deductions which in turn  depending on the exact resolution  could significantly impact the economics of these transactions 
however  we believe our reserves for this exposure were adequate at december  further  the fasb has begun to consider whether any change in the timing of tax benefits associated with these transactions should result in a recalculation under sfas  accounting for leases  and whether a lessor should re evaluate the classification of a leveraged lease when a recalculation of the lease is performed 
in march  the fasb directed its staff to issue a proposed staff position on this issue 
if the fasb ultimately decides companies must recalculate and re evaluate leveraged lease classification  the impact on us could be material 
for example  a cumulative adjustment to earnings could be required and the leases may no longer qualify as leveraged leases 
since the fasb has not finalized any guidance and we have not reached any settlement with the irs  we cannot currently estimate the potential impact 
even though we intend to pursue resolution with the irs through administrative appeal remedies  it is possible we will be unable to reach a settlement 
if we are unable to reach settlement  we will evaluate other options  including litigation 
there is  of course  no guarantee as to the outcome of litigation 
in addition to the transactions described above  two lease to service contract transactions that we were party to were structured as partnerships for tax purposes 
we have been informed that the partnerships are under audit by the irs 
however  we do not believe that our exposure from these transactions is material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the irs is also beginning an audit of our consolidated federal income tax returns 
we expect them to again propose adjustments to the cross border lease transactions described above as well as to new cross border lease transactions entered in these years 
vehicle and aircraft leasing businesses during the fourth quarter of  we recognized the benefit of a million settlement related to our vehicle leasing business 
we reached this settlement with insurance carriers regarding certain residual value claims for which a reserve had been provided in during the second quarter of  we completed the sale of our subsidiary  pnc vehicle leasing llc  and the related vehicle lease portfolio and other assets 
in connection with this transaction  we also terminated our related residual insurance policies with our remaining residual insurance carrier 
as a result of these actions  we have completed the exit of the consumer vehicle leasing business  including our related exposures to the used vehicle market and the payment of future residual insurance claims 
we recognized a pretax net loss of million related to this sale during the second quarter of on september   we acquired the business of the aviation finance group  llc afg  an idaho based company that specializes in loans to finance private aircraft 
historically  afg has originated a diversified loan portfolio with average individual loan balances of approximately million and a loan to value ratio below 
afg s loan volume has exceeded million annually over the past few years 
by combining the business of afg with our existing business  we expect to increase our ability to offer a variety of loans and leasing products to corporate aircraft customers

at december   the securities available for sale balance included a net unrealized loss of million  which represented the difference between fair value and amortized cost 
the comparable amount at december  was a net unrealized gain of million 
the impact on bond prices of increases in interest rates during was reflected in the net unrealized loss position at december

further increases in interest rates after december   if sustained  will adversely impact the fair value of securities available for sale in compared with the balance at year end 
net unrealized gains and losses in the securities available for sale portfolio are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss  net of tax 
the expected weighted average life of securities available for sale was years and months at december  compared with years and months at december  we estimate the effective duration of securities available for sale is years for an immediate basis points parallel increase in interest rates and years for an immediate basis points parallel decrease in interest rates 
loans held for sale education loans held for sale totaled billion at december  and billion at december  and represented the majority of our loans held for sale at each date

the increase of 
billion  to billion  in total shareholders equity at december  compared with the prior year end was primarily attributable to million of common stock issued as part of the january united national acquisition and a higher retention of earnings through in anticipation of the ssrm acquisition by blackrock and the pending acquisition of riggs 
partially offsetting this increase was a decline in the fair value of securities available for sale and cash flow hedge derivatives due to the impact of rising interest rates that began during the second quarter of and continued into the latter half of the year 
these fair value changes are captured in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of shareholders equity 
see note comprehensive income in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information 
common shares outstanding at december  were million  an increase of million over december   principally due to the issuance of common shares for the acquisition of united national

as of february   the program was terminated  and a new program to purchase up to million shares was authorized 
this program will remain in effect until fully utilized or until modified  superseded or terminated 
the extent and timing of share repurchases under the program will depend on a number of factors including  among others  market and general economic conditions  economic and regulatory capital considerations  alternative uses of capital  and the potential impact on our credit rating 
the pending acquisition of riggs and blackrock s acquisition of ssrm will cause us to constrain share purchases over the next several quarters as we seek to maintain our capital position

table of contents review of businesses we operate five major businesses engaged in providing banking  asset management and global fund processing products and services 
banking businesses include regional community banking  wholesale banking and wealth management 
our treasury management activities  which include cash and investment management  receivables management  disbursement services and global trade services  capital markets products  which include foreign exchange  derivatives and loan syndications  and equipment leasing products are offered through wholesale banking and marketed by several businesses across pnc 
results of individual businesses are presented based on our management accounting practices and our operating structure 
there is no comprehensive  authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to generally accepted accounting principles gaap  therefore  the financial results of individual businesses are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company 
we refine our methodologies from time to time as our management accounting practices are enhanced and our businesses change 
financial results are presented  to the extent practicable  as if each business operated on a stand alone basis 
we changed our financial reporting for our business segments beginning with first quarter reporting and restated all prior period amounts to conform with the new methodology 
the principal changes to our segment reporting are as follows we replaced the assignment of securities or funds to balance net assets for each business segment with a funds transfer pricing methodology 
we removed the impact of our asset and liability management function from the business segments 
this is now reflected in the results of other 
the wholesale banking business segment captures the results that were previously reported separately as corporate banking  pnc real estate finance and pnc business credit to more accurately reflect the integrated operating strategy of this business 
we have implemented a new capital measurement methodology based on the concept of economic capital for regional community banking  wholesale banking  pnc advisors and pfpc 
however  we increased the capital assigned to regional community banking to of funds to reflect the capital required for well capitalized banks and to approximate market comparables for this business 
the capital for blackrock reflects legal entity shareholders equity consistent with blackrock s separate public financial statement disclosures 
we have allocated the allowance for loan and lease losses based on our assessment of risk inherent in the loan portfolios 
our allocation of the costs incurred by operations and other support areas not directly aligned with the businesses is primarily based on the use of services

the impact of this change in future periods is not expected to be significant 
c included in other noninterest income 
regional community banking earnings increased million in compared with growth in customer relationships  loans and deposits combined with the united national acquisition produced a increase in revenues 
the revenue increase was partially offset by a increase in noninterest expenses and a increase in the segment s provision for credit losses 
performance highlights for regional community banking for include a increase in average demand deposit balances over  which was driven by an increase in consumer and small business checking account relationships 
approximately of this net growth in checking relationships was from new customers with the remainder attributable to the acquisition of united national 
small business relationships grew by  and drove growth in commercial loans and small business deposits 
approximately of the growth in relationships resulted from accelerated acquisition of new customers while the remaining increase was attributable to united national 
this increase was driven by additional sales staff  including increased small business customer calling efforts by branch managers 
average loans for increased billion or over levels driven by strong consumer and small business loan demand 
approximately of this dollar increase in loans was attributable to united national 

table of contents a continuation of efforts to expand and optimize the configuration of the branch network 
during the year  we opened six stand alone and in store branches  and acquired branches from united national 
these additions to the branch network  partially offset by the consolidation and sale of certain branches  increased the network total to branches 
the percentage of our consumers banking with us online continued to increase 
as of december  of our consumer checking relationships were utilizing web based banking options compared with a year earlier 
taxable equivalent net interest income increased million in primarily due to loan growth of and deposit balance growth of 
the benefits of the loan and deposit growth were partially offset by a lower value assigned to deposits and additional carrying costs related to goodwill associated with united national 
all of the goodwill associated with the united national acquisition is reflected in the regional community banking segment 
noninterest income increased by million over driven by the increase in checking relationships  higher income from payment related products such as debit card and merchant services  and higher gains on sales of education loans and the sale of two branches 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in atm surcharge revenue related to our strategic downsizing of out of footprint atms 
investment revenues decreased million due to a reduced customer demand for fixed annuity products 
in we also introduced free checking for small business customers and free web bill pay for consumers  and increased penetration of free checking for consumers initiatives geared toward improving customer acquisition and retention but which negatively impacted fee income growth 
the provision for credit losses increased by million over the larger provision was driven mainly by loan growth and management s decision earlier in to change the charge off policy for commercial loans less than  overall credit quality indicators are currently stable and have improved over home equity fico scores  loan to value ratios and accounts days past due improved 
we update fico scores for each account on a quarterly basis 
while we are committed to lending within a moderate risk profile  further improvements in credit quality are not anticipated for provisions for credit losses are expected to increase commensurate with loan growth in the coming year 
noninterest expenses in included million of costs related to the acquisition of united national  including million of conversion related and other nonrecurring costs 
approximately million in expense growth can be attributed to the build out of our branch network in store branches associated with the stop shop initiative and standalone branch sites  expansion of the small business sales force  increased marketing and sales activities  as well as higher technology expenditures related to investments in teller and back office operations to increase productivity  improve service and strengthen risk management processes 
we have adopted a relationship based lending strategy to target homeowners  small businesses and auto dealerships while seeking to maintain a moderate risk profile in the loan portfolio 
home equity loans grew by billion or on average for compared with the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to continued strength in loan demand  the united national acquisition and the purchase of a million portfolio in the first quarter of home equity loans have experienced strong growth over the recent periods of low interest rates 
we would expect future growth rates to moderate as interest rates rise 
average commercial loans grew on the strength of increased loan demand from existing customers  the united national acquisition and an increase in the rate of small business customer acquisition 
floor plan and indirect loan portfolios grew and respectively over levels due to managed increases in our dealer portfolio through new relationships  the united national acquisition and a renewed emphasis on indirect lending 
residential mortgage loans increased million due to the addition of a million portfolio associated with the united national acquisition 
the overall portfolio is decreasing as payoffs occur 
this trend is expected to continue in growth in core deposits as a low cost source of funding is one of the primary objectives of our checking relationship growth strategy 
average total deposits increased billion or on average in compared with the prior year 
the deposit growth was driven by increases in the number of checking and savings relationships and the united national acquisition 
average consumer and small business demand deposits grew over last year driven by the growth in our customer base and the acquisition of united national 
for the year  the growth rate in balances  particularly in the consumer segment  exceeded the growth rate in relationships  as customers were hesitant to move funds into perceived higher risk alternatives such as equities  bonds or long term cds during a period of low interest rates and economic uncertainty 
as such  we expect the future average demand deposit balance growth rate to be closer to the customer growth rate 
customer integration and retention efforts for united national have been successful as evidenced by a stable customer base and deposit portfolio since the transaction was completed 
checking relationship retention has improved and benefited from the increased penetration rates of debit card  online banking and online bill payment products and services 
customer balances in other deposit products including savings  money market and certificates of deposit increased million primarily due to the united national acquisition 
fourth quarter average portfolios grew by million compared with second quarter as the rise in interest rates began to attract funds back into certificates of deposits after an extended period of portfolio declines in a low interest rate environment

taxable equivalent net interest income for increased million compared with  primarily due to loan and deposit growth 
as economic expansion continues  we expect our customers to require additional lending facilities and to increase utilization of existing facilities 
although competition for high quality customers has increased  we believe we can continue to compete effectively through competitive pricing and the strength of our product offerings  such as treasury management and capital markets products and services 
we are winning new clients both within our primary geographic footprint and across the nation  and this expansion is being achieved within our prudent risk return parameters 
our corporate banking and national secured lending businesses  business credit  leasing and real estate finance  have benefited from improving economic conditions and improved sales efforts  resulting in significant loan growth 
the provision for credit losses was million for compared with million in the reduced provision was attributable to improved overall credit quality  as demonstrated by an million reduction in net charge offs and a reduction in nonperforming assets compared with while we intend to continue to initiate new business within our prudent risk return parameters  we do not expect to continue to experience significant levels of improvement in credit quality in in addition  we anticipate that our provision for credit losses will increase in  driven by loan growth 
noninterest income for decreased  to million compared with the decrease was attributable primarily to a million reduction in net gains on institutional loans held for sale compared with and million of securities gains in related to the liquidation of two entities formed in in connection with the pagic transactions 
these factors were partially offset by higher fees from our commercial mortgage servicing  treasury management  and capital markets products

the business ended with superior investment performance in fixed income and liquidity products and continued to experience favorable operating leverage in these areas 
the performance of the equity business improved following its restructuring

managed account services grew its asset base to billion  an increase of compared with december   reflecting the success of the advisorport separate accounts platform and related sales efforts 
fund servicing revenue increased million in compared with reflecting the positive impact of new sales of accounting administration services  offshore growth and growth in alternative investment and custody assets serviced 
in addition  million of the increase represented out of pocket and pass through items that had no impact on earnings 
these factors were partially offset by highly competitive pricing in certain of pfpc s product areas and transfer agency client deconversion 
revenue loss attributable to the sale of pfpc s retirement services business during was largely replaced by the higher margin revenue from the advisorport acquisition that also occurred in operating expense increased million  or  in compared with apart from the out of pocket and pass through items referred to above  the net impact of the advisorport and retirement services transactions reduced operating expenses by million in compared with the prior year 
pfpc also benefited by million in incremental cost savings initiatives in pfpc incurred higher depreciation of technology investments and other noncompensation expenses during which offset the benefits described above 
these benefits were also partially offset by a lower benefit from accretion of a single discounted client contract liability that ended during the second quarter of pfpc s earnings also benefited from a reduction in pretax financing costs of million  attributable to the retirement of debt during and of million and million  respectively  with pnc affiliates and the refinancing of certain remaining debt obligations with pnc affiliates at more favorable terms 
pfpc anticipates continued reductions of debt principal during this benefit was partially offset by an million reduction in nonoperating income  largely driven by an increase in non debt balance sheet funding 
effective january  pfpc restructured portions of its remaining intercompany debt obligations given the rate environment at that time 
contractually  pfpc incurred million in debt prepayment penalties to effect the restructuring  which is expected to be more than offset by resulting interest expense savings of approximately million over the prepayment penalty will be reflected in pfpc s first quarter results 
for information regarding a first quarter settlement with a former transfer agency client  we direct you to note subsequent events in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
pfpc s performance is partially dependent on the underlying performance of its fund clients and  in particular  their ability to attract and retain customers 
as a result  to the extent that pfpc clients businesses are adversely affected by ongoing governmental investigations into the practices of the mutual and hedge fund industries  pfpc s results could be impacted 
increases in both accounting administration and custody fund assets at december  compared with the prior year end resulted primarily from net new business  asset inflows from existing clients and generally positive equity market performance during subaccounting shareholder accounts serviced by pfpc increased in primarily due to net new business and growth in existing client accounts 
total assets serviced by pfpc amounted to trillion at december  compared with trillion at december  
table of contents risk factors we are subject to a number of risks potentially impacting our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition to the risks described in other parts of this report  including the supervision and regulation section of item and the risk management and cautionary statement regarding forward looking information sections of item  the following are the key risk factors that affect us 
business and economic conditions  impact of monetary and other policies a sustained weakness or weakening in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we do business could have one or more of the following impacts on our business a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us  a decrease in the value of our loans held for sale  an increase or decrease in the usage of unfunded commitments  or an increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent  file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us 
an increase in the number of delinquencies  bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets  net charge offs  provision for credit losses  and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale 
given our business mix  and the fact that most of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature  we tend to be particularly sensitive to market interest rate movement and the performance of the financial markets 
in addition to the impact on the economy generally  with some of the potential effects outlined above  changes in interest rates or in valuations in the debt or equity markets could directly impact us in one or more of the following ways such changes could affect the value of certain of our on balance sheet and off balance sheet financial instruments or the value of equity investments that we hold  such changes could affect the value of the assets that we manage or otherwise administer  such changes could affect the value of assets for which we provide processing services  or to the extent to which we access capital markets to raise funds to support our business  such changes could affect the cost of such funds or our ability to raise such funds 
a more detailed description of aspects of the interest rate and market risks facing us is included in the risk management section of item of this report 
the monetary  tax and other policies of the government and its agencies  including the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve board  have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance  and thus can affect the activities and results of operations of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries  such as pnc and our subsidiaries 
an important function of the federal reserve board is to regulate the national supply of bank credit 
the federal reserve board employs open market operations in us government securities  changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings  and changes in reserve requirements on bank deposits to implement its monetary policy objectives 
these instruments of monetary policy are used in varying combinations to influence the following the overall level of bank loans  investments and deposits  the interest rates charged on loans and paid for deposits  the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets  and the level of inflation 
the federal reserve board s policies have a general impact on the united states and  to some extent  global economies  but also have a significant specific impact on bank holding companies and others in the financial services industry  which specific impact is felt throughout pnc 
by affecting market interest rates  these policies influence the rates of interest that we charge on loans and that we pay on borrowings and interest bearing deposits and  as described above  can also affect the value of our on balance sheet and off balance sheet financial instruments 
both due to the impact on rates and by controlling access to direct funding from the federal reserve banks  these policies also influence  to a significant extent  our cost of funding 
we cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary  tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on our activities and results of operations 
pending acquisition of riggs national corporation  other acquisitions our pending acquisition of riggs national corporation presents us with a number of risks and uncertainties related both to the transaction itself and to the integration of the remaining riggs businesses into pnc 
these risks and uncertainties include the following completion of the transaction is dependent on  among other things  receipt of stockholder and regulatory approvals and regulatory waivers  the timing of which cannot be predicted with precision at this point and which may not be received at all 
successful completion of the transaction and our ability to realize the benefits that we anticipate from the acquisition also depend on the nature of any future developments with respect to riggs regulatory and legal issues  the ability to comply with the terms of all current or future requirements including any related action plan resulting from these issues  and the extent of future costs and expenses arising as a result of these issues  including the impact of increased litigation risk and any claims for indemnification or advancement of costs 
riggs regulatory and legal issues may cause reputational harm to pnc following the acquisition and integration of its business into ours 
the transaction may be materially more expensive to complete than anticipated as a result of unexpected factors or events 

table of contents the integration into pnc of the riggs business and operations that we acquire  which will include conversion of riggs different systems and procedures  may take longer or be more costly than anticipated and may have unanticipated adverse results relating to riggs or pnc s existing businesses 
it may take longer than expected to realize the anticipated cost savings of the acquisition  and the anticipated cost savings may not be achieved in their entirety 
the anticipated strategic and other benefits of the acquisition to pnc are dependent in part on the future performance of riggs business 
we can provide no assurance as to actual future results  which could be affected by various factors  including the risks and uncertainties generally related to the performance of pnc s and riggs businesses with respect to riggs  you may review riggs sec reports  which are accessible on the sec s website at www 
sec 
gov or due to factors related to the acquisition of riggs and the process of integrating riggs business at closing into pnc 
in addition to the pending riggs acquisition  we grow our business from time to time by acquiring other financial services companies 
other acquisitions generally present similar risks to those described above relating to the riggs transaction 
we could also be prevented from pursuing attractive acquisition opportunities due to regulatory restraints 
competition we operate in a highly competitive environment  both in terms of the products and services offered and the geographic markets in which we conduct business 
this environment could become even more competitive in the future as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation in the financial services industry 
we compete with the following local  regional and national banks  thrifts and credit unions  non bank financial institutions  such as investment banking firms  investment advisory firms  brokerage firms  investment companies  private equity firms  mutual fund complexes and insurance companies  and other entities that offer financial and processing services 
our competitive environment is also impacted by the growth of alternative delivery channels  in particular the internet  which facilitates competition by removing geographic barriers to providing certain of our products and services and which provides an additional and non traditional way in which companies seeking to provide banking and other financial services can distinguish themselves 
technological advances and legislation  among other changes  have lowered barriers to entry  have made it possible for non bank institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks  and have increased the level of competition that we face 
many of our competitors benefit from fewer regulatory constraints and lower cost structures  allowing for more competitive pricing of products and services 
as a result  we could lose business to competitors or be forced to price our products and services on less advantageous terms to retain customers 
asset management performance asset management revenue is primarily based on a percentage of the value of assets under management and performance fees  in most cases expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on assets under management 
a decline in the value of debt and equity instruments  among other things  could cause our asset management revenue to decline 
investment performance is an important factor influencing the level of assets under management 
poor investment performance could impair revenue and growth as existing clients might withdraw funds in favor of better performing products 
also  performance fees could be lower or nonexistent 
additionally  the ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish 
fund servicing fund servicing fees are primarily derived from the market value of the assets and the number of shareholder accounts that we administer for our clients 
a rise in interest rates or a sustained weakness  weakening or volatility in the debt and equity markets could influence an investor s decision to invest or maintain an investment in a mutual fund or other pooled investment product 
as a result  fluctuations may occur in the level or value of assets for which we provide processing services 
a significant investor migration from mutual fund and other pooled investments could result in lower revenues for us by reducing the assets and the number of shareholder accounts that we service 
the fund servicing business is also highly competitive  with a relatively small number of providers 
there has been and continues to be merger  acquisition and consolidation activity in the financial services industry 
future mergers or consolidations of financial institutions or other financial intermediaries could impact the number of existing or potential fund servicing clients 
terrorist activities and international hostilities the impact of terrorist activities and responses to such activities and of international hostilities cannot be predicted with respect to severity or duration  but may adversely affect the economy and financial and capital markets generally  or specific industries and us specifically 
the impact could adversely affect us in a number of ways including  among others  an increase in delinquencies  bankruptcies or defaults that could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets  net charge offs and provision for credit losses 

table of contents critical accounting policies and judgments our consolidated financial statements are prepared by applying certain accounting policies 
note accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report describes the most significant accounting policies that we use 
certain of these policies require us to make estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or be subject to variations that may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods 
we must use estimates  assumptions  and judgments when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at  or adjusted to reflect  fair value 
assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility 
fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on either quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third party sources  when available 
when such third party information is not available  we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions  or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations 
allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit we maintain allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at levels that we believe are sufficient to absorb estimated probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio 
we determine the adequacy of the allowances based on periodic evaluations of the credit portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including  among others expected default probabilities  loss given default  exposure at default  amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  value of collateral  estimated losses on consumer loans and residential mortgages  and general amounts for historical loss experience 
our process also considers economic conditions  uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the various credit portfolios 
all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
also  we base the allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses to specific loan pools on historical loss trends and our judgment concerning those trends 
commercial loans are the largest category of credits and are the most sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
we have allocated approximately million  or  of the total allowance for loan and lease losses at december  to the commercial loan category 
this allocation also considers other relevant factors such as actual versus estimated losses  regional and national economic conditions  business segment and portfolio concentrations  industry competition and consolidation  the impact of government regulations  and risk of potential estimation or judgmental errors  including the accuracy of risk ratings 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates  additional provision for credit losses may be required that would reduce future earnings 
see the following for additional information allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the credit risk management section of item of this report  and note accounting policies and note allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements  and allocation of allowance for loan and lease losses in the statistical information section in item of this report 
private equity asset valuation at december   private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled million compared with million at december  we value private equity assets at each balance sheet date based primarily on either  in the case of limited partnership investments  the financial statements received from the general partner or  for direct investments  the estimated fair value of the investments 
there is a time lag in our receipt of the financial information that is the primary basis for the valuation of our limited partnership interests 
we recognized in the fourth quarter of valuation changes related to limited partnership investments that reflected the impact of third quarter market conditions and performance of the underlying companies 
due to the nature of the direct investments  we must make assumptions as to future performance  financial condition  liquidity  availability of capital  and market conditions  among others  to determine the estimated fair value of the investments 
the valuation procedures that we apply to direct investments include techniques such as cash flow multiples for the entity  independent appraisals of the value of the entity or the pricing used to value the entity in a recent financing transaction 
we value general partnership interests based on the underlying investments of the partnership utilizing procedures consistent with those applied to direct investments 
we reflect changes in the value of equity management investments in our results of operations 
market conditions and actual performance of the companies that we invest in could differ from these assumptions  resulting in lower valuations that could reduce earnings in future periods 
accordingly  the valuations may not represent amounts that will ultimately be realized from these investments 

table of contents commercial mortgage servicing rights commercial mortgage servicing rights msr are intangible assets that represent the value of rights that arise from the servicing of commercial loan contracts 
while servicing is inherent in most financial assets  it becomes a distinct asset a when contractually separated from the underlying financial asset by sale or securitization of the asset with servicing retained or b through the separate purchase and assumption of the servicing 
the value of our msr asset both originated and purchased arises from estimates of future revenues from contractually specified servicing fees  interest income and other ancillary revenues  net of estimated operating expenses which are expected to provide an acceptable level of risk adjusted return for us as the servicer 
we estimate the fair value of our msr asset using a discounted cash flow methodology that calculates the net present value of future cash flows of the servicing portfolio over the estimated life of the asset based on various assumptions and market factors 
the most significant assumptions and market factors include interest rates for escrow and deposit balance earnings  discount rates  estimated prepayment speeds  and estimated servicing costs 
we review the reasonableness of these factors based on expectations of the portfolio  market conditions  and loan characteristics 
our commercial loan servicing portfolio is subject to various risks  the most significant being interest rate risk  which subject our msr asset to impairment risk 
while our msr asset is amortized over its estimated life in proportion to estimated net servicing income  it is also tested for impairment at a strata level on a quarterly basis 
the impairment testing includes a positive and negative scenario for sensitivity characteristics 
if the estimated fair value of the msr is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss would be recognized in the current period  however  any fair value in excess of the cost basis would not be recognized as income 
we include additional information in note accounting policies  note goodwill and other intangible assets and note securitizations and retained interests in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
lease residuals we provide financing for various types of equipment  aircraft  energy and power systems  and rolling stock through a variety of lease arrangements 
leases are carried at the sum of lease payments and the estimated residual value of the leased property  less unearned income 
residual value insurance or guarantees by governmental entities cover a significant portion of the residual value 
residual values are subject to judgments as to the value of the underlying equipment that can be affected by changes in economic and market conditions and the financial viability of the residual guarantors and insurers 
to the extent not guaranteed or assumed by a third party  or otherwise insured against  we bear the risk of ownership of the leased assets 
this includes the risk that the actual value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term will be less than the residual value  which could result in an impairment charge and reduce earnings in the future 
these residual values are reviewed for impairment no less than on an annual basis 
see note accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information 
goodwill goodwill arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
most of our goodwill relates to value inherent in the fund servicing and banking businesses 
the value of this goodwill is dependent upon our ability to provide quality  cost effective services in the face of competition from other market participants on a national and global basis 
this ability in turn relies upon continuing investments in processing systems  the development of value added service features  and the ease of access to our services 
as such  goodwill value is supported ultimately by earnings  which is driven by the volume of business transacted and  for certain businesses  the market value of assets under administration or for which processing services are provided 
lower earnings resulting from a lack of growth or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill  which could result in a charge and reduced earnings in the future 
at least annually  management evaluates events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment in the carrying amount of goodwill 
see note accounting policies and note goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information 
revenue recognition we derive net interest and noninterest income from various sources  including lending  securities portfolio  investment management and fund servicing  customer deposits  loan servicing  brokerage services  sale of loans and securities  certain private equity activities  and securities and derivatives trading activities including foreign exchange 
we also earn fees and commissions from issuing loan commitments  standby letters of credit and financial guarantees  selling various insurance products  providing treasury management services and participating in certain capital market transactions 
the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize in any period is dependent on estimates  judgments  assumptions  and interpretation of contractual terms 
changes in these factors can have a significant impact on revenue recognized 
table of contents in any period due to changes in products  market conditions or industry norms 
see note accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information 
income taxes because our ownership interest in blackrock  as measured by value  is less than  federal tax law requires us to file two consolidated federal income tax returns one for pnc and subsidiaries excluding the consolidated results of blackrock and its subsidiaries  and a second return solely for blackrock and its subsidiaries 
we and our subsidiaries also file state and local income tax returns in many jurisdictions 
in the normal course of business  we and our subsidiaries enter into transactions for which the tax treatment is unclear or subject to varying interpretations 
in addition  filing requirements  methods of filing and the calculation of taxable income in various state and local jurisdictions are subject to differing interpretations 
we evaluate and assess the relative risks and merits of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions  filing positions  filing methods and taxable income calculation after considering statutes  regulations  judicial precedent  and other information  and maintain tax accruals consistent with our evaluation of these relative risks and merits 
the result of our evaluation and assessment is by its nature an estimate 
we and our subsidiaries are routinely subject to audit and challenges from taxing authorities 
in the event we resolve a challenge for an amount different than amounts previously accrued  we will account for the difference in the period in which we resolve the matter 
our tax treatment of certain leasing transactions is currently being challenged by the irs  as described in greater detail in the consolidated balance sheet review section of item of this report 
legal contingencies we are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims  including those described in note legal proceedings in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report and others arising in the normal course of our business 
we review these matters with internal and external legal counsel and accrue reserves when we determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly review these accruals and adjust the reserves as appropriate to reflect changes in the status of the proceedings and claims 
the reserves that we establish for these types of contingencies are based upon our opinion of the likely future outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims 
the final resolution of legal and regulatory proceedings is frequently different  possibly significantly  from the resolution we anticipated 
also  we may not be able to reasonably estimate the loss from a proceeding even if some liability is probable or the actual loss may be different from an estimated loss 
as a result  our ultimate financial exposure to legal and regulatory proceedings and claims may be substantially different from what is reflected in the related reserves 
blackrock long term retention and incentive plan see note stock based compensation plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for a description of the blackrock ltip 
based on the price performance of its common shares  blackrock management determined that full vesting of the ltip awards was probable as of september   and as a result recorded a charge and a related liability in its third quarter results 
this charge took into account the value of the awards granted through september  and the applicable service period 
we reported a pretax charge totaling million  including million of compensation expense  million of employee benefits expense and million of other noninterest expense in our consolidated statement of income 
the after tax impact on our third quarter results after taking into account the adjustment for minority interests we own approximately of blackrock was million  or 
per diluted share 
this includes a pro rata share of the estimated dilution of our investment in blackrock that is expected to occur in when we transfer shares of blackrock stock to fund a portion of the ltip awards 
fourth quarter ltip pretax charges reported by pnc totaled million  comprised of million of compensation expense and million of other noninterest expense 
we expect to report additional pretax charges of approximately million per quarter through december related to the remaining service period of the ltip awards granted to date  assuming the ltip awards vest or full vesting remains probable 
additional information on the third quarter ltip charge is included in our and blackrock s current reports on form k dated october  recent accounting pronouncements see note accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information on the following recent accounting pronouncements that are relevant to our business  including a description of each new pronouncement  the required date of adoption  our planned date of adoption and the expected impact on our consolidated financial statements

status of defined benefit pension plan we have a noncontributory  qualified defined benefit pension plan plan or pension plan covering eligible employees 
retirement benefits are derived from a cash balance formula based on compensation levels  age and length of service 
pension contributions are based on an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan participants 
plan assets are currently approximately invested in equity investments with most of the remainder invested in fixed income instruments 
plan fiduciaries determine and review the plan s investment policy 
we calculate the expense associated with the pension plan in accordance with sfas  employers accounting for pensions  and we use assumptions and methods that are compatible with the requirements of sfas  including a policy of reflecting trust assets at their fair market value 
on an annual basis  we review the actuarial assumptions related to the pension plan  including the discount rate  rate of compensation increase and the expected return on plan assets 
neither the discount rate nor the compensation increase assumptions significantly affect pension expense 
however  the expected long term return on assets assumption does significantly affect pension expense 
actual investment returns also significantly affect expense  as each one percentage point difference in actual return compared with our expected return causes the following year s expense to change by up to million 
below are the effects of certain changes in assumptions  using estimated expense as a baseline 
estimated increase to pension expense in millions 
decrease in discount rate 
decrease in expected long term return on assets 
increase in compensation rate we currently estimate a pretax million benefit to pension expense in compared with pretax expense of million in the primary reasons for the expected decrease in pension expense in are favorable returns on investment assets in  which reduce amortization of actuarial losses and increase the asset used to calculate expected returns for  and plan modifications relating to pfpc  as future retirement benefits will accrue only under a defined contribution plan 
in accordance with sfas and sfas revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  we may have to eliminate any prepaid pension asset and recognize a minimum pension liability if the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets at year end 
we would recognize the corresponding charge as a component of other comprehensive income and it would reduce total shareholders equity  but it would not affect net income 
at december   the fair value of plan assets was billion  which exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation of billion 
the status at year end will depend primarily upon investment returns and the level of contributions  if any  made to the plan by us during plan asset investment performance has the most impact on contribution requirements 
however  contribution requirements are not particularly sensitive to actuarial assumptions 
investment performance will drive the amount of permitted contributions in future years 
also  current law sets limits as to both minimum and maximum contributions to the plan 
in any event  any large near term contributions to the plan will be at our discretion  as we expect that the minimum required contributions under the law will be minimal or zero for several years 
we maintain other defined benefit plans that have a less significant effect on financial results  including one qualified pension plan for united national employees and various nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees 
on march   we merged into our plan one defined benefit plan covering some employees of united national 
we merged the remaining united national plan into our plan during the fourth quarter of we contributed million to the united national plans during the first quarter of expense associated with the united national plans was minimal for see note employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information 
risk management we encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks 
this risk management section first provides an overview of the risk measurement  control strategies  and monitoring aspects of our corporate level risk management processes 
following that discussion is an analysis of the risk management process for what we view as our primary areas of risk credit  operational  liquidity  and market 
the discussion of market risk is further 
table of contents subdivided into interest rate  trading  and equity and other investment risk areas 
our use of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process is also addressed within the risk management section of this report 
in appropriate places within this section  historical performance is also addressed 
overview as a financial services organization  we take a certain amount of risk in every business decision 
for example  every time we open an account or approve a loan for a customer  process a payment  hire a new employee  or implement a new computer system  we incur a certain amount of risk 
as an organization  we must balance revenue generation and profitability with the risks associated with our business activities 
risk management is not about eliminating risks  but about identifying and accepting risks and then effectively managing them so to optimize shareholder value 
the key to effective risk management is to be proactive in identifying  measuring  evaluating  and monitoring risk on an ongoing basis 
risk management practices support decision making  improve the success rate for new initiatives  and strengthen the organization 
corporate level risk management overview we support risk management through a governance structure involving the board  senior management and a corporate risk management organization 
although our board as a whole is responsible generally for oversight of risk management  committees of the board provide oversight to specific areas of risk with respect to the level of risk and risk management structure 
we use management level risk committees to help ensure that business decisions are executed within our desired risk profile 
the executive risk management committee ermc  consisting of senior management executives  provides oversight for the establishment and implementation of new comprehensive risk management initiatives  reviews enterprise level risk profiles and discusses key risk issues 
the corporate risk management organization has the following key roles facilitate the identification  assessment and monitoring of risk across pnc  provide support and oversight to the businesses  and identify and implement risk management best practices  as appropriate 
risk measurement we conduct risk measurement activities specific to each area of risk 
the primary vehicle for aggregation of enterprise wide risk is a comprehensive risk management methodology that is based on economic capital 
this primary risk aggregation measure is supplemented with secondary measures of risk to arrive at an estimate of enterprise wide risk 
the economic capital framework is a measure of potential losses above and beyond expected losses 
potential one year losses are capitalized to a level commensurate with a financial institution with an a rating by the credit rating agencies 
economic capital incorporates risk associated with potential credit losses credit risk  fluctuations of the estimated market value of financial instruments market risk  failure of people  processes or systems operational risk  and income losses associated with declining volumes  margins and or fees  and the fixed cost structure of the business business risk 
we estimate credit and market risks at an exposure level while we estimate the remaining risk types at an institution or business segment level 
we routinely compare the output of our economic capital model with industry benchmarks 
risk control strategies we centrally manage policy development and exception oversight through corporate level risk management 
corporate risk management is authorized to take action to either prevent or mitigate exceptions to policies and is responsible for monitoring compliance with risk management policies 
the corporate audit function performs an independent analysis of the internal control environment 
corporate audit plays a critical role in risk management  testing the operation of the internal control system and reporting findings to management and to the audit committee 
risk monitoring corporate risk management reports on a regular basis to our board regarding the enterprise risk profile of the corporation 
these reports aggregate and present the level of risk by type of risk and communicate significant risk issues  including performance relative to risk tolerance limits 
both the board and the ermc provide guidance on actions to address key risk issues as identified in these reports 
credit risk management credit risk represents the possibility that a customer  counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms 
credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers  purchasing securities  and entering into financial derivative transactions 
credit risk is one of the most common risks in banking and is one of our most significant risks 
approved risk tolerances  in addition to credit policies and procedures  set portfolio objectives for the level of credit risk 
we have established guidelines for acceptable levels of total borrower exposure  problem loans  and other credit measures 
we seek to achieve our credit portfolio objectives by maintaining a customer base that is diverse in borrower exposure and industry types 
we use loan participations with third parties  loan sales and syndications  and the purchase of credit derivatives to reduce risk concentrations 
the credit granting businesses maintain direct responsibility for credit risk within pnc 
the corporate credit policy area provides independent oversight to the measurement  monitoring and reporting of pnc s credit risk and reports to the chief risk officer 
credit risk review also provides an independent assessment of the credit risk profile and the findings from targeted reviews

allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses to absorb losses from the loan portfolio 
we determine the allowance based on quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
while we make allocations to specific loans and pools of loans  the total reserve is available for all loan losses 
in addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses  we maintain an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit 
we report this allowance as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
we determine this amount using estimates of the probability of the ultimate funding and losses related to those credit exposures 
this methodology is similar to the methodology we use for determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses 

table of contents we establish specific allowances for loans considered impaired using a method prescribed by sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
all nonperforming loans are considered impaired under sfas specific allowances for individual loans over a set dollar threshold are determined by our special asset committee based on an analysis of the present value of the loan s expected future cash flows discounted at its effective interest rate  its observable market price  or the fair value of the underlying collateral 
we establish a minimum specific allowance on all impaired loans at the applicable pool reserve allocation for similar loans 
allocations to non impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans pool reserve allocations are assigned to pools of loans as defined by our business structure and internal risk rating categories 
key elements of the pool reserve methodology include probability of default pd  which is derived from historical default analyses and is a function of the borrower s risk rating grade and expected loan term  loss given default lgd  which is derived from historical loss data and is a function of the loan s collateral value and other structural factors that may affect our ultimate ability to collect on the loan  and exposure at default ead  which is derived from banking industry and our own exposure at default data 
our pool reserve methodology is sensitive to changes in key risk parameters such as pds  lgds and eads 
in general  a given change in any of the major risk parameters will have a corresponding change in the pool reserve allocations for non impaired commercial loans 
our commercial loans are the largest category of credits and are most sensitive to changes in the key risk parameters and pool reserve loss rates 
to illustrate  if we increase the pool reserve loss rates by for all categories of nonimpaired commercial loans  then the aggregate of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit would increase by million 
additionally  other factors such as the rate of migration in the severity of problem loans or changes in the maturity distribution of the loans will contribute to the final pool reserve allocations 
we make consumer including residential mortgage loan allocations at a total portfolio level by consumer product line based on historical loss experience 
we compute a four quarter average loss rate from net charge offs for the prior four quarters as a percentage of the average loans outstanding in those quarters 
we apply this loss rate to loans outstanding at the end of the current period to determine the consumer loan allocation 
the final loan reserve allocations are based on this methodology and our judgment of other qualitative factors that may include  among others regional and national economic conditions  business segment and portfolio concentrations  historical versus estimated losses  model risk  and changes to the level of credit risk in the portfolio 
we establish reserves to provide coverage for probable losses not considered in the specific  pool and consumer reserve methodologies  such as  but not limited to  potential judgment and data errors 
furthermore  events may have occurred as of the reserve evaluation date that are not yet reflected in the risk measures or characteristics of the portfolio due to inherent lags in information 
our evaluation of these factors and other relevant factors  such as the imprecision in estimating probable losses  determines the level of reserves established at the evaluation date 
the total amount of reserves for these factors was million at december  and million at december  and were assigned in the tables below to loan categories and to business segments based on the relative specific and pool allocation amounts

during the first quarter of  we changed our policy for recognizing charge offs on smaller nonperforming commercial loans 
as a result  we recognized an additional million of gross charge offs for the first quarter of for the remaining nine months of  this portion of the portfolio experienced a reduction in gross charge offs and an increase in recoveries from expected levels 
the impact of this change in future periods is not expected to be significant 
credit related instruments credit default swaps credit default swaps provide  for a fee  an assumption by a third party of a portion of the credit risk related to the underlying financial instruments 
we use the contracts primarily to mitigate credit risk associated with commercial lending activities and convertible bond trading 
at december   we used credit default swaps with million in notional amount to reduce credit risk associated with commercial lending activities and million in notional amount to reduce risk associated with convertible arbitrage trading 
the comparable amount was million at december  for commercial lending activities 
credit default swaps are included in the free standing derivatives table in the financial derivatives section of item of this report 
we realized net losses in connection with credit default swaps of million during and million in interest rate derivative risk participation agreements we enter into risk participation agreements to share credit exposure with other financial counterparties related to interest rate derivative contracts or take on credit exposure to generate revenue 
risk participation agreements entered into subsequent to june  used by us to mitigate credit risk had a notional amount of million at december  compared with million at december  risk participation agreements in which we assumed credit exposure had a notional amount of million at december  there were none as of december  agreements entered into prior to july  are considered to be financial guarantees and  therefore  are not included in the financial derivatives section of item of this report 
risk participation agreements entered prior to july  used by us to mitigate credit risk had a notional amount of million at december  compared with million at december  risk participation agreements entered into in which we assumed credit risk exposure had a total notional amount of million at december  compared with million at december  operational risk management operational risk is defined as the risk of financial loss or other damage to us resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems  human factors  or from external events 
operational risk may occur in any of our business activities and manifests itself in various ways  including but not limited to the following errors related to transaction processing and systems  breaches of the system of internal controls and compliance requirements  business interruptions  and execution of unauthorized transactions and fraud by employees or third parties 

table of contents operational losses may arise from legal actions due to operating deficiencies or noncompliance with contracts  laws or regulations 
to monitor and control operational risk  we maintain a comprehensive framework including policies and a system of internal controls that is designed to manage risk and to provide management with timely and accurate information about the operations of pnc 
management at each business unit is primarily responsible for its operational risk management program  given that operational risk management is integral to direct business management and most easily effected at the business unit level 
corporate operational risk management  reporting to the chief risk officer  oversees day to day operation risk management activities 
technology risk the technology risk management program is a significant component of the operational risk framework 
we have an integrated security and technology risk management framework designed to help ensure a secure  sound  and compliant infrastructure for information management 
the technology risk management process is aligned with the strategic direction of the businesses and is integrated into the technology management culture  structure and practices 
the application of this framework across the enterprise helps to support comprehensive and reliable internal controls 
our business resiliency program manages the organization s capabilities to provide services in the case of an event 
prioritization of investments in people  processes  technology and facilities are based on different types of events  business risk and criticality 
comprehensive testing validates our resiliency capabilities on an ongoing basis  and an integrated governance model is designed to help assure transparent management reporting 
insurance as a component of our risk management practices  we purchase insurance programs designed to protect us against accidental loss or losses which  in the aggregate  may significantly affect personnel  property  financial objectives  or our ability to continue to meet our responsibilities to our various stakeholder groups 
pnc  through subsidiary companies  alpine indemnity limited and pnc insurance corp  participates as a reinsurer for its general liability  automobile liability and workers compensation programs and as a direct writer for its property and certified domestic terrorism programs 
pnc s risks associated with its participation as a reinsurer or direct writer for these programs are mitigated through policy limits  annual aggregate limits  umbrella excess liability coverage and reinsurance ceded beyond per occurrence deductible limits 
liquidity risk management liquidity risk is the risk of potential loss if we were unable to meet our funding requirements at a reasonable cost 
we manage liquidity risk to help ensure that we can obtain cost effective funding to meet current and future obligations under both normal business as usual and stressful circumstances 
asset and liability management alm  reporting to the vice chairman and chief financial officer  is accountable for managing the liquidity position within the limits and guidelines set forth in our risk management policies 
market risk management provides independent oversight for the measurement  monitoring and reporting of pnc s liquidity risk and reports to the chief risk officer 
we typically maintain our liquidity position through a large and stable deposit base derived from our retail and wholesale banking activities  a portfolio of liquid investment securities  diversified sources of short term and long term wholesale funding  and significant unused borrowing capacity at both the federal home loan bank and the federal reserve discount window 
liquid assets consist of short term investments federal funds sold and other short term investments and securities available for sale 
at december   our liquid assets totaled billion  with billion pledged as collateral for borrowings  trust  and other commitments 
pnc bank  na is a member of the federal home loan bank and as such has access to advances from the federal home loan bank secured generally by residential mortgages  other real estate related loans  and mortgage backed securities 
at december   our total unused borrowing capacity from the federal home loan bank under current collateral requirements was billion 
we can also obtain funding through alternative forms of borrowing  including federal funds purchased  repurchase agreements  and short term and long term debt issuance 
on july   pnc bank  na established a program to offer up to billion in senior and subordinated unsecured debt obligations with maturities of more than nine months 
as of december   pnc bank  na had issued billion of debt under this program  including million of month floating rate notes  due march issued during the third quarter of with interest payable at the rate of month libor minus basis points  and million of subordinated notes due issued during the fourth quarter of these notes are not redeemable or subject to repayment at the option of the holder prior to maturity 
on december   pnc bank  na established a program to offer up to billion of its commercial paper 
as of december   no commercial paper had been issued under this program 
on march   pnc issued two series of senior debt under pnc s effective shelf registration statements 
the first series consisted of million of senior notes due and the second series consisted of million of senior notes due the senior notes due were issued at a price of  resulting in proceeds to pnc of approximately million 
the senior notes due were issued at a price of  resulting in proceeds to pnc of approximately million 
neither series of senior notes is redeemable by pnc or subject to repayment at the option of the holder prior to maturity 

table of contents the parent company s routine funding needs consist primarily of the return of capital to shareholders dividends and share repurchases  debt service and the funding of its non bank affiliates and acquisitions 
parent company liquidity guidelines are designed to help ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet these requirements over the succeeding twelve month period 
in managing parent company liquidity we consider funding sources  such as expected dividends to be received from pnc bank  na and potential debt issuance  and discretionary funding uses  the most significant of which is the external dividend to be paid on pnc s stock 
the principal source of parent company cash flow is the dividends it receives from pnc bank  na  which may be impacted by the following capital needs  laws and regulations  corporate policies  contractual restrictions  and other factors 
also  there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of national banks to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or its non bank subsidiaries 
we provide additional information on these limitations in note regulatory matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report and include such information here by reference 
the amount available for dividend payments to the parent company by pnc bank  na without prior regulatory approval was approximately million at december  in addition to dividends from pnc bank  na  other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and short term investments  as well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries 
as of december   the parent company had approximately million in funds available from its cash and short term investments 
we can generate liquidity for the parent company and pnc s non bank subsidiaries through the issuance of securities in public or private markets 
at december   we had unused capacity under effective shelf registration statements of approximately billion of debt or equity securities of which approximately million was used for the senior notes issues in march referred to above and million of trust preferred capital securities 
the parent company also had an unused non reciprocal credit facility of million at december  during the fourth quarter of  million of parent company senior debt matured 
as of december   there were no parent company contractual obligations with maturities less than one year

market risk management overview market risk is the risk of a loss in earnings or economic value due to adverse movements in market factors such as interest rates  credit spreads  foreign exchange rates  and equity prices 
we are exposed to market risk primarily by our involvement in the following activities traditional banking activities of taking deposits and extending loans  private equity and other investments and activities whose economic values are directly impacted by market factors  and trading in fixed income products  equities  derivatives  and foreign exchange  as a result of customer activities  underwriting  and proprietary trading 
we have established enterprise wide policies and methodologies to identify  measure  monitor  and report market risk 
market risk management provides independent oversight by monitoring compliance with these limits and guidelines  and reporting significant risks in the business to the board finance committee and ermc 
market risk management interest rate risk interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans 
many factors  including economic and financial conditions  movements in interest rates  and consumer preferences  affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities 
because of repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products  changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near term earnings  but the economic values of these assets and liabilities as well 
alm centrally manages interest rate risk 
alm is responsible for making investment and trading decisions within authorized limits and guidelines for both economic value of equity eve and net interest income 
in managing interest rate risk  we limit our reliance on a particular interest rate scenario and position the balance sheet to grow net interest income and net interest margin within our targeted risk profile 
we use the following to achieve these objectives securities purchases and sales  mix of short term and long term funding  financial derivatives  and other capital markets instruments 
the activities of alm are subject to interest rate risk limits and certain policies approved by alco and the board finance committee

the following net interest income sensitivity to alternative rate scenarios table reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the next two month periods assuming the pnc economist s most likely rate forecast  implied market forward rates and a lower flatter rate scenario 
we are inherently sensitive to a flatter yield curve 
when forecasting net interest income  we make assumptions about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve  the volume and characteristics of new business  and the behavior of existing positions 
these assumptions determine the future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate scenario and the other interest rate scenarios presented in the following table 
these simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature  they are replaced or repriced at market rates 
all changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current market rates are assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast horizon 
net interest income sensitivity to alternative rate scenarios as of december  pnc economist market forward low flat change in forecasted net interest income first year sensitivity second year sensitivity the graph below presents the yield curves for the base rate scenario and each of the alternative scenarios one year forward 
logo over the last several years  we have taken steps to position our balance sheet to benefit from rising long term interest rates under the belief that the current environment  characterized by recently low rates  will not continue over the longer term 
going forward  we believe that we have the deposit funding base and flexibility to change our investment profile to take advantage of opportunities presented by a higher rate environment 

table of contents market risk management trading risk our trading activities include the underwriting of fixed income and equity securities  as well as customer driven and proprietary trading in fixed income securities  equities  derivatives  and foreign exchange 
trading activities are confined to financial instruments and financial derivatives 
for each trading group eg  fixed income  derivatives  foreign exchange  we have implemented a set of risk limits that govern that particular group 
our overall corporate trading risk policy governs the nature and allocation of these limits 
we use a variety of statistical and non statistical measurements to assess the level of market risk arising from trading activities 
we use value at risk var as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in trading activities 
var offers a common measure to compare trading risk across portfolios with exposures to different types of market factors 
as required under the market risk amendment to the basel accord  we calculate risk weighted capital for trading activities  which is driven by average var usage 
for internal risk management purposes  we also estimate the amount of economic capital required at a level of confidence by trading activities over a one year horizon 
this measure is driven by both average var usage and potential future usage based on portfolio var limits 
an enterprise wide var limit on trading activities is established by the board finance committee 
var limits for individual business units are established by alco 
the following table shows var usage for by product type var usage by product type in millions min max avg fixed income equity foreign exchange total to help ensure the integrity of the models used to calculate var for each portfolio and enterprisewide  we use a process known as backtesting 
the backtesting process consists of comparing actual observations of trading related gains or losses against the var levels that were calculated at the close of the prior day 
we would expect a maximum of two to three instances a year in which actual losses exceeded the prior day var measure 
during the full year of  there were no such instances at the enterprise wide level 
this indicates that pnc uses a conservative enterprise wide var measure 
the following graph shows a comparison of enterprise wide trading related gains and losses against prior day var for the period 
logo total trading related revenue was million in  million for and million for trading related revenue includes both net interest income and noninterest income from trading activities 
enterprise wide trading related losses occurred on of the business days in see note trading activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information 
market risk management equity and other investment risk equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets 
in addition to extending credit  taking deposits  and underwriting and trading financial instruments  we make and manage direct investments in a variety of transactions  including management buyouts  recapitalizations  and later stage growth financings in a variety of industries 
we have investments in non affiliated and affiliated funds that make similar private equity investments  although new investments in non affiliated funds will be minimal 
the economic and or book value of these investments and other assets such as loan servicing rights are directly affected by changes in market factors 
the primary risk measurement for equity and other investments is the concept of economic capital 
the economic capital is a common measure of risk for credit  market and operational risk 
it is the worst case value depreciation over one year within confidence level 
given the illiquid nature of many of these types of investments  it can be a challenge to determine their fair values 
market risk management provides independent oversight of the valuation process 
pnc equity management corp 
pnc emc and other pnc business units manage our equity and other investment activities 
the board finance committee approves policies and capital limits related to investment activities across pnc 
our businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the approved policy limits and guidelines 

table of contents private equity the private equity portfolio is comprised of investments that vary by industry  stage and type of investment 
we continue to make private equity investments at a moderate pace  consistent with current market conditions 
private equity investments are reported at fair value 
changes in the values of private equity investments are reflected in our results of operations 
due to the nature of the direct investments  we must make assumptions as to future performance  financial condition  liquidity  availability of capital  and market conditions  among other factors  to determine the estimated fair value of the investments 
market conditions and actual performance of the investments could differ from these assumptions 
accordingly  lower valuations may occur that could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
also  the valuations may not represent amounts that will ultimately be realized from these investments 
see private equity asset valuation in the critical accounting policies and judgments section of item of this report for additional information 
at december   private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled million compared with million at december  as of december   approximately of the amount is invested directly in a variety of companies and approximately is invested in various limited partnerships 
private equity unfunded commitments totaled million at december  compared with million at december  other investments we also make investments in affiliated and non affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment strategies 
such investments include investments in blackrock s mutual funds  hedge funds  and cdos 
the economic values could be driven by either the fixed income market or the equity markets  or both 
as of december   major investments of this type included low income housing tax credits and capitalized servicing rights for commercial mortgage loans 
economic capital our economic capital committee governs the measurement of economic capital 
this committee meets at least quarterly to review economic capital measurements and approve methodology changes 
the economic capital framework is a measure of the potential losses above and beyond expected losses 
potential one year losses are capitalized to a level consistent with a financial institution with an a rating by the credit rating agencies 
economic capital incorporates risk associated with potential credit losses credit risk  fluctuations of the estimated market value of financial instruments market risk  failure of people  processes or systems operational risk  and income losses associated with declining volumes  margins and or fees  and the fixed cost structure of the business business risk 
we estimate credit and market risks at an exposure level while we estimate the remaining risk types at an institution or business segment level 
we routinely compare the output of our economic capital model with industry benchmarks 
impact of inflation our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
accordingly  future changes in prices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money 
during periods of inflation  monetary assets lose value in terms of purchasing power and monetary liabilities have corresponding purchasing power gains 
the concept of purchasing power  however  is not an adequate indicator of the effect of inflation on banks because it does not take into account changes in interest rates  which are an important determinant of our earnings 
financial derivatives we use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage interest rate  market and credit risk inherent in our business activities 
substantially all such instruments are used to manage risk related to changes in interest rates 
interest rate and total return swaps  interest rate caps and floors and futures contracts are the primary instruments used by us for interest rate risk management 
financial derivatives involve  to varying degrees  interest rate  market and credit risk 
for interest rate swaps and total return swaps  caps and floors and futures contracts  only periodic cash payments and  with respect to caps and floors  premiums  are exchanged 
therefore  cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount 
not all elements of interest rate  market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial or other derivatives  and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market characteristics  among other reasons 
accounting hedges fair value hedging strategies we enter into interest rate and total return swaps  caps  floors and interest rate futures derivative contracts to hedge designated commercial mortgage loans held for sale  commercial loans  bank notes  senior debt and subordinated debt for changes in fair value primarily due to changes in interest rates 
adjustments related to the ineffective portion of fair value hedging instruments are recorded in interest income  interest expense or noninterest income depending on the hedged item 

table of contents accounting hedges cash flow hedging strategy we enter into interest rate swap contracts to modify the interest rate characteristics of designated commercial loans from variable to fixed in order to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future interest income 
the fair value of these derivatives is reported in other assets or other liabilities and offset in accumulated other comprehensive income for the effective portion of the derivatives 
when the hedged transaction culminates  any unrealized gains or losses related to these swap contracts are removed from accumulated other comprehensive income and are included in interest income 
any ineffectiveness of the strategy  as defined by our documented policies and procedures  is reported in interest income 
free standing derivatives to accommodate customer needs  we also enter into financial derivative transactions primarily consisting of interest rate swaps  caps  floors and foreign exchange and equity contracts 
we manage our market risk exposure from customer positions through transactions with third party dealers 
the credit risk associated with derivatives executed with customers is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans and is subject to normal credit policies 
we may obtain collateral based on our assessment of the customer 
also included in free standing derivatives are transactions that we enter into for risk management and proprietary purposes that are not designated as accounting hedges  primarily interest rate basis swaps  total return swaps  credit default swaps and certain interest rate lock loan origination commitments as well as commitments to buy or sell mortgage loans 
basis swaps are agreements involving the exchange of payments  based on notional amounts  of two floating rate financial instruments denominated in the same currency  one pegged to one reference rate and the other tied to a second reference rate eg  swapping payments tied to one month libor for payments tied to three month libor 
we use these contracts to mitigate the impact on earnings of exposure to a certain referenced interest rate 
interest rate lock commitments for  as well as commitments to buy or sell  real estate mortgage loans that we intend to sell are considered free standing derivatives 
our interest rate exposure on the rate lock commitments is economically hedged with pay fixed interest rate swaps and forward sale commitments 
these contracts mitigate the impact on earnings of exposure to a certain referenced rate 
we purchase credit default swaps to mitigate the economic impact of credit losses on specifically identified existing lending relationships 
these derivatives typically are based upon the change in value  due to changing credit spreads  of publicly issued bonds issued by our customer 
we enter into risk participation agreements to share some of the credit exposure with other financial counterparties related to interest rate derivative contracts or to take on credit exposure to generate revenue 
we will be required to make receive payments under these guaranties if a customer defaults on its obligation to perform under certain credit agreements 
agreements entered into prior to july  are considered financial guarantees 
agreements entered into after june  are considered free standing derivatives 
we occasionally purchase or originate financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative 
at the inception of the financial instrument  we assess whether the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the financial instrument host contract  whether the financial instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative and the host contract is measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings  and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative 
if the embedded derivative does not meet these three conditions  the embedded derivative would qualify as a derivative instrument and be recorded apart from the host contract and carried at fair value with changes recorded in current earnings 
free standing derivatives also include positions we take based on market expectations or to benefit from price differentials between financial instruments and the market based upon stated risk management objectives
