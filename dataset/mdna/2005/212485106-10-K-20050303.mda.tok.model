as discussed more fully in note of notes to financial statements  the company leases certain facilities and equipment used in its operations under operating leases 
this includes the company s office complex in orlando  florida  which is leased from wachovia development corporation lessor  a wholly owned subsidiary of wachovia corporation  under an agreement that expires in june the lessor acquired the complex from an unaffiliated third party for  its appraised value  and began leasing it to the company in june the lessor partially funded the purchase of the office complex with the issuance of in notes sold to two non affiliated institutional investors 
the remaining was funded through a combination of bank debt and equity 
under the terms of the lease  which is treated as an operating lease  the company s monthly lease payments include a fixed and variable component 
upon termination or expiration  the company must either purchase the property from the lessor for or arrange to have the office complex sold to a third party 
if the office complex is sold to a third party for an amount less than the financed by the lessor  the company has agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor up to if the office complex is sold to a third party for an amount in excess of  the company is entitled to collect the excess 
at the inception of the lease  the company recognized a liability of approximately for the related residual value guarantee 
the value of the guarantee was determined by computing the estimated present value of probability weighted cash flows that might be expended under the guarantee 
the company has recorded a liability for the fair value of the obligation with a corresponding asset recorded as prepaid rent  which as being amortized to rental expense over the lease term 
the liability will remain on the balance sheet until the end of the lease term 
under the terms of the lease  the company also provides certain indemnities to the lessor  including environmental indemnities 
due to the nature of such potential obligations  it is not possible to estimate the maximum amount of such exposure or the fair value 
the company does not expect such amounts  if any  to be material 
the company has concluded that it is not required to consolidate the lessor pursuant to financial accounting standards board financial interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 as the company is not the primary beneficiary 
the company believes that its present ability to borrow is greater than its established credit facilities in place 
if market conditions change and the company experiences a significant decline in revenues  its cash flows and liquidity could be reduced 
this could cause rating agencies to lower the company s credit ratings  thereby increasing its borrowing costs  or even causing a reduction in or elimination of its access to debt and ability to raise additional equity 

table of contents on february   the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of its common shares 
on april   the board of directors authorized the additional repurchase of up to million of its common shares 
the company repurchased million shares of convergys stock for pursuant to these authorizations 
the company may continue to execute share repurchases from time to time in order to take advantage of attractive share price levels  as determined by management 
the timing and terms of the transactions depend on a number of considerations including market conditions and the company s liquidity 
the following summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods total less than year years after years contractual obligations debt operating leases purchase commitments total see note of notes to financial statements for further information

consists of contractual obligations to purchase services that are enforceable and legally binding 
excludes issuance of purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are short term or cancelable  as well as renewable support and maintenance arrangements 
at december   the company had outstanding letters of credit of related to performance and payment guarantees 
the company believes that any obligation that may arise will not be material 
as further described in note  the company has not provided for us federal income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries at december   because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely 
in addition  the company has not completed its evaluation of the repatriation provision of the american jobs creation act and is not expected to complete the evaluation until the end of the range of the income tax impact of such repatriation cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
market risk the company s activities expose it to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the company s risk management strategy includes the use of derivative instruments to reduce the effects on its operating results and cash flows from fluctuations caused by volatility in currency exchange and interest rates 
in using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and interest rates  the company exposes itself to some counterparty credit risk 
the company manages exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with highly rated institutions that can be expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements and by diversifying the number of financial institutions with which it enters into such agreements 
interest rate risk at december   the company had in outstanding variable rate borrowings and had sold in accounts receivable on a variable rate basis 
the carrying amount of the company s borrowings reflects fair value due to its short term and variable interest rate features 
in connection with the december issuance of in unsecured senior notes that are due december   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of  which the company designated as a hedge 
the purpose of the swap is to protect the notes against changes in fair value due to changes in interest rates 
under the terms of the interest rate swap  the company receives interest at a fixed rate of and pays interest at a variable rate based on libor 
the maturity date of the interest rate swap is december  the carrying value of the notes has been adjusted to reflect the fair value of the interest rate swap 

table of contents the company also uses  from time to time  cash flow hedges to protect against interest rate exposure 
these instruments are hedges of forecasted transactions or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability 
these contracts are entered into to protect against the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from such transactions will be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
there were no outstanding cash flow hedges covering interest rate exposure at december  based upon the company s exposure to variable rate borrowings  including amounts sold under the accounts receivable securitization and the interest rate swap  a one percentage point change in the weighted average interest rate would change the company s annual interest expense by approximately foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars 
the primary currencies to which the company is exposed include the british pound  the indian rupee  the philippine peso  the euro and the canadian dollar 
the company currently uses forward exchange contracts and options to limit potential losses in earnings or cash flows from adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements 
these contracts are entered into to protect against the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from such transactions will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
the potential loss in fair value at december  for such contracts resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in all foreign currency exchange rates is approximately this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures 
cmg serves a number of its us based customer care clients using contact center capacity in canada  india and the philippines 
although the contracts with these clients are typically priced in us dollars  a substantial portion of the costs incurred by cmg to operate these non us contact centers is denominated in canadian dollars  india rupees or philippine pesos  which represents a foreign exchange exposure to the company 
the canadian dollar cad strengthened from an average of per us dollar in to per us dollar in once translated into us dollars  this resulted in approximately in additional operating expenses  which was partially offset by gains that resulted from the settlement and maturity of the company s canadian dollar forward exchange contracts 
as of december   the company had the following open canadian forward exchange contracts maturing notional value average exchange rate first half of cad second half of cad first half of cad second half of cad additionally  the company had options with a notional value of approximately cad with exchange rates ranging from to that expire beginning august through december critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of notes to financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments in these areas based on its historical experience and other relevant factors 
the company s estimates as of the date of the financial statements reflect its best judgment giving consideration to all currently available facts and circumstances 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future  as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 
management has identified below the accounting policies and estimates that it believes are most critical in compiling the company s financial condition and operating results 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 

table of contents goodwill at december   the company had goodwill with a net carrying value of as disclosed in note of notes to financial statements  the company is required to test goodwill for impairment annually and at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 
the impairment test for goodwill involves a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the fair value  the second step requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss 
fair value of the reporting unit was determined using the income approach 
under the income approach  value is dependent on the present value of net cash flows to be derived from the ownership 
the income approach requires significant estimates about future cash flows and discount rates 
as required  the company completed its annual impairment tests for its reporting units during the fourth quarter of based on the results of the first step  the company had no goodwill impairment related to its four reporting units information management international  information management north america  customer care and employee care 
although the company makes every reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of its estimate of the fair value of its reporting units  future changes in the assumptions used to make these estimates could result in the recording of an impairment loss 
for example  a decline in the company s estimate of its employee care s reporting unit s fair value could result in it performing the second step of the impairment test as described above for the of goodwill recorded by this reporting unit 
a decrease  however  in the estimate of the fair value of any of the other three reporting units would not lead to any further tests for impairment 
deferred charges in connection with certain of the company s outsourcing arrangements  the company from time to time will incur direct and incremental costs  consisting principally of non refundable cash payments made to clients  to acquire or extend a contractual relationship 
to the extent recovery of these costs is probable  the company capitalizes these costs and amortizes them ratably over the life of the contract as a reduction of revenue 
in connection with its outsourcing arrangements  the company also performs initial implementations  which include the installation and customization of its proprietary software in its centers 
under these arrangements  clients do not take possession of the software nor have the right to take possession of the software without incurring a significant penalty 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  the implementations are not treated as separate elements for revenue recognition purposes 
any proceeds collected for the implementations are deferred and recognized over the service period 
additionally  with respect to certain license arrangements  the company defers all revenue related to the arrangements including revenues related to the implementation services and recognizes it over the period the company is providing support and maintenance 
the company capitalizes all direct and incremental implementation and multiple element costs  to the extent recovery is probable  and amortizes them ratably over the life of the arrangements as costs of providing service 
at inception and throughout the term of the contract  the company evaluates recoverability by considering profits to be earned during the term of the contract  the creditworthiness of the client and  if applicable  contract termination penalties payable by the client in the event that the client terminates the contract early 
the company s estimate of profitability is dependent in large part on its estimate of costs 
although the company makes every reasonable effort to accurately estimate costs  revisions may be made based on actual costs incurred that could result in the recording of an impairment loss 
additionally  if the financial condition of a client were to deteriorate  resulting in a reduced ability to make payments  the company may be unable to recover the costs  which would result in an impairment loss 
finally  the company s entitlement to termination fees may be subject to challenge if a client were to allege that the company was in breach of contract 
however  based on its evaluation of the related contracts  the company believes that the of deferred charges is recoverable 
revenue recognition for certain contracts  the company recognizes software license and related professional and consulting revenues using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs at completion 
during  less than of the company s consolidated revenues were recognized using the percentage of completion method 
this method of accounting relies on estimates of total expected contract revenues and costs 
this method is used because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
because the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of the contracts  recognized revenues are subject to revisions as the contracts progress to completion 
revisions in estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
accordingly  favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenue recognition  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in the reversal of previously recognized revenues 
when estimates indicate a loss under a contract  a provision for such loss is recorded as a component of the costs of providing services 
as work progresses under a loss contract  revenues continue to be recognized  and a portion of the contract loss incurred in each period is charged to the contract loss reserve 
the company believes it makes every reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of its estimates of completion 

table of contents contingencies the company considers the likelihood of various loss contingencies  including tax and legal contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business  and its ability to make a reasonable estimate of its loss 
pursuant to sfas no 
 contingent liabilities  the company accrues for a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company has filed or is in the process of filing federal  state and foreign tax returns that are subject to audit by the respective tax authorities 
although the ultimate outcome is unknown  management believes that adequate amounts have been provided for and any adjustments that may result from tax return audits are not likely to have a material  adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
as disclosed in note of notes to financial statements  six separate lawsuits were filed in the court of common pleas  cuyahoga county  ohio  against cincinnati smsa limited partnership and other defendants 
convergys is a limited partner of cincinnati smsa limited partnership  with a ownership interest

each of the reseller cases seeks damages ranging from to plus treble damages under ohio law 
the consumer case seeks damages in excess of plus treble damages under ohio law 
all five of the reseller cases have been dismissed 
however  two of these dismissals are being appealed 
a motion to dismiss the consumer case is pending 
pursuant to the partnership agreement  convergys  as a limited partner  has no right to direct or participate in the defense of these actions and  therefore  has no current ability to assess the merit of any claims made in these actions or identify any possible loss that could result from these claims against the partnership 
restructuring accrual the company recorded significant restructuring charges related to the reduction in headcount and facility closures during and as of december   the company had a restructuring accrual of  of which relates to facility closure costs  which will be paid over several years until the leases expire 
the accrual is equal to the future costs associated with those abandoned facilities  net of the proceeds from any probable future sublease agreements 
the company has used estimates  based on consultation with real estate advisors  to arrive at the proceeds from any future sublease agreements 
as evidenced by the reversal of the restructuring accrual for facility abandonment costs that was recorded in the fourth quarter of see note of notes to financial statements for further discussion  the company will continue to evaluate its estimates in recording the facilities abandonment charge 
as a result  there may be additional charges or reversals in the future 
other the company has made certain other estimates that  while not involving the same degree of judgment  are important to understanding the company s financial statements 
these estimates are in the areas of measuring its obligations related to its defined benefit plans  valuation allowances related to its deferred tax assets  self insurance accruals  determining vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value in connection with its license arrangements and assessing recoverability of intangible assets 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
this pronouncement requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the company is required to adopt sfas no 
r beginning july  the adoption of this pronouncement is expected to result in approximately of incremental stock compensation expense in risks relating to convergys and its business client consolidations could result in a loss of clients and reduce the company s revenues 
convergys serves clients in industries that have experienced a significant level of consolidation in recent years 
the company cannot assure that additional consolidations will not occur in which convergys clients acquire additional businesses or are acquired 
such consolidations may result in the termination of an existing client contract  which would result in a decrease of the company s revenues 

table of contents on october   cingular completed its acquisition of at t wireless  the company s largest client in terms of revenue and a significant client for both img and cmg 
with respect to img  cingular has stated their initial intention is to migrate subscribers off of the at t wireless billing systems that the company supports onto cingular s two in house systems one of which the company supports by december  if this migration occurs  it will have a negative impact on img s revenues and earnings 
cmg also has had a long standing relationship with at t wireless for customer care services 
cmg has not had a relationship with cingular  nor has cingular had the opportunity to evaluate the services that cmg provides to at t wireless 
at this time  cingular has not given any indication that it intends to change its relationship with cmg 
should cingular s acquisition of at t wireless lead to a reduction in cmg s business  it could have a negative impact on cmg s revenues and earnings over time 
on december   sprint pcs announced plans to acquire and merge with nextel communications 
also  on january   sbc communications announced plans to acquire and merge with at t corporation 
the impact of these mergers on the company is also unknown 
a large portion of the company s revenues are generated from a limited number of clients  and the loss of one or more of its clients could cause a reduction in its revenues 
the company relies on several significant clients for a large percentage of its revenues 
convergys three largest clients  cingular  directv and sprint pcs  represented approximately of convergys revenues 
the company s relationship with cingular is represented by separate contracts work orders with various operating units across both img and cmg 
the company serves directv under a customer care contract 
its relationship with sprint pcs is represented by separate contracts with img and cmg 
it should be noted that beginning february  the customer care services provided to sprint pcs are through a contract between sprint pcs and ibm  whereby the company serves as a subcontractor to ibm 
also in october  cingular acquired at t wireless 
these separate contracts work orders with the above clients have varying expiration dates  payment provisions  termination provisions and other conditions 
therefore  convergys does not believe that it is likely that its entire relationship with cingular  directv or sprint pcs would terminate at one time  and  therefore  it is not substantially dependent on any particular contract work order with these clients 
however  the loss of all of the contracts work orders within a particular client at the same time or the loss of one or more of the larger contracts work orders within a client would adversely affect the company s total revenues if the revenues from such client were not replaced with revenues from that client or other clients 
a large portion of the company s accounts receivable are payable by a limited number of clients  the inability of any of these clients to pay its accounts receivable or the company s failure to deliver services that are contractually prescribed could cause a reduction in the company s income 
several significant clients account for a large percentage of the company s accounts receivable 
as of december   convergys three largest clients  cingular  directv and sprint together accounted for of the company s net accounts receivable excluding the effects of the accounts receivable securitization 
during the past three years  each of the clients set forth above has generally paid its accounts receivable on a timely basis  and convergys has only had write downs in connection with such accounts receivable in line with those that it incurs with other clients 
the company anticipates that  in  several clients will continue to account for a large percentage of accounts receivable 
although as explained above  convergys has numerous contracts work orders with different units of these clients with varying terms and provisions including payment provisions  if any of these clients were unable  for any reason  to pay its accounts receivable  the company s income would decrease 
if convergys clients are not successful  the amount of business that they outsource and the prices that they are willing to pay for such services may be diminished and could result in reduced revenues for the company 
convergys revenues are dependent on the success of its clients 
if convergys clients are not successful  the amount of business that they outsource may be diminished 
thus  although the company has signed contracts  many of which contain minimum revenue commitments  to provide services to its clients  there can be no assurance that the level of revenues to be received from such contracts will meet expectations 
in addition  several clients  particularly in the communications and technology industries  have experienced substantial price competition 
as a result  the company may face increasing price pressure from such clients  which could negatively affect its operating performance 

table of contents the company s failure to keep its technology up to date may prevent the company from remaining competitive 
technology is a critical component of the company s success  whether it is one of its billing software products provided to a client through a license or data processing outsourcing arrangement or technology used by customer care or employee care agents in connection with outsourcing services 
in order to remain competitive  the company will need to continue to invest in the development of new and enhanced technology 
although the company is committed to further investment in development  there can be no assurance that the company s technology will be adequate to meet its future needs or enable the company to remain competitive 
the company s failure to keep its technology up to date may hinder its ability to remain competitive 
as a result  competitors could attract business from the company s existing and potential clients and the company s revenues could decrease 
defects or errors within its software products could adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
design defects or software errors may delay product introductions or damage client satisfaction and may have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s billing software products are highly complex and may  from time to time  contain design defects or software errors that may be difficult to detect and or correct 
since the company s billing software products are used by the company and its clients to perform critical business functions  design defects  software errors or other potential problems within or outside of the company s control may arise from the use of its software 
it may also result in financial or other damages to the clients  for which the company may be held responsible 
although the company s license agreements with its clients generally contain provisions designed to limit the company s exposure to potential claims and liabilities arising from client problems  these provisions may not effectively protect the company against such claims in all cases and in all jurisdictions 
claims and liabilities arising from client problems could result in monetary damages to the company and could damage the company s reputation  adversely affecting its business  results of operations and financial condition 
emergency interruption of data centers and customer care and employee care contact centers could have an adverse  material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s outsourcing operations are dependent upon its ability to protect its proprietary software and client information maintained in its data processing  customer care and employee care contact centers against damage that may be caused by fire  natural disasters  power failure  telecommunications failures  computer viruses  acts of sabotage or terror and other emergencies 
in the event the company experiences a temporary or permanent interruption at one or more of its data or contact centers  through casualty  operating malfunction or other acts  the company may be unable to provide the data processing  customer care and employee care services it is contractually obligated to deliver 
this could result in the company being required to pay contractual damages to some clients or allow some clients to terminate or renegotiate their contracts 
notwithstanding contingency plans and precautions taken to protect the company and its clients from events that could interrupt delivery of services  there can be no assurance that such interruptions would not result in a prolonged interruption in the company s ability to provide support services to its clients 
additionally  the company maintains property and business interruption insurance  however  such insurance may not adequately compensate the company for any losses it may incur 
if the global trend toward outsourcing does not continue  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
revenue growth depends in large part on the industry trend toward outsourcing these services  particularly as it relates to the company s customer care and employee care outsourcing operations 
outsourcing involves companies contracting with a third party  such as convergys  to provide customer care and employee care services rather than perform such services in house 
there can be no assurance that this trend will continue  as organizations may elect to perform such services in house 
a significant change in this trend could have a materially adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
if the company is unable to identify and complete appropriate acquisitions as it has historically  the company may not be able to grow at the same rate that it has historically 
convergys growth has been enhanced through acquisitions of other businesses including their products  service offerings and licenses 
the company continues to pursue strategic acquisitions 
if the company is unable to make appropriate acquisitions on reasonable terms  whether for cash  convergys securities or both  it may be difficult for the company to achieve the same level of growth as achieved historically 

table of contents the company is susceptible to business and political risks from international operations that could result in reduced revenues or earnings 
convergys operates businesses in many countries outside the united states  which are located throughout north and south america  europe  the middle east and the asian pacific region 
in connection with its strategy  the company plans to capture more of the international billing and employee care markets 
additionally  there is increasing demand for offshore customer care outsourcing capacity from north american companies 
as a result  the company expects to continue expansion through start up operations and acquisitions in additional countries 
expansion of its existing international operations and entry into additional countries will require management attention and financial resources 
in addition  there are certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally including exposure to currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles  greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in complying with a variety of foreign laws  unexpected changes in legal or regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  political instability and potentially adverse tax consequences 
to the extent that the company does not manage its international operations successfully  its business could be adversely affected and its revenues and or earnings could be reduced 
in addition  there has been political discussion and debate related to worldwide competitive sourcing  particularly from the united states to offshore locations 
in the past  there has been proposed federal and state legislation related to this issue 
future legislation  if enacted  could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
if the us dollar does not strengthen  the company s earnings will continue to be negatively impacted 
cmg serves an increasing number of its us based customer care clients using contact center capacity in canada  india and the philippines 
although the contracts with these clients are typically priced in us dollars  a substantial portion of the costs incurred by cmg to operate these non us contact centers is denominated in canadian dollars  indian rupees or philippine pesos  which represents a foreign exchange exposure to the company 
the company enters into forward exchange contracts and options to limit potential foreign currency exposure 
as the us dollar weakened  the operating expenses of these contact centers  once translated into us dollars  increased in comparison to prior years 
the increase in operating expenses was offset partially by gains realized through the settlement of canadian dollar forward exchange contracts 
if the us dollar does not strengthen  the company s earnings will continue to be negatively impacted 
if the company does not effectively manage its capacity  its results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company s ability to profit from the global trend toward outsourcing depends largely on how effectively it manages its customer care and employee care contact center capacity 
there are several factors and trends that have intensified the challenge of contact center management 
in order to create the additional capacity necessary to accommodate new or expanded outsourcing projects  the company must consider opening new contact centers 
the opening or expansion of a contact center may result  at least in the short term  in idle capacity until any new or expanded program is implemented fully 
the company periodically assesses the expected long term capacity utilization of its contact centers 
as a result  it may  if deemed necessary  consolidate  close or partially close under performing contact centers in order to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve or maintain optimal utilization of its contact center capacity 
the company s failure to successfully manage consolidation could cause its business to suffer 
as part of the consolidation of facilities  the company believes that it will sublease or assign a portion of that surplus space and recover certain costs associated with it 
to the extent that it is not successful in achieving this result  the company s expenses will increase 

table of contents if the company is unable to hire or retain qualified personnel in certain areas of its business  its ability to execute its business plan could be impaired and revenues could decrease 
convergys employs approximately  employees worldwide 
despite the recent headcount reductions  the company continues to recruit and hire qualified persons in the research and development  sales  marketing and administrative and services areas of its business in several parts of the world 
at times  the company has experienced difficulties in hiring personnel with the right training or experience 
additionally  particularly with regards to cmg where the business is very labor intensive  quality service depends on the company s ability to control personnel turnover 
any significant increase in the employee turnover rate could increase recruiting and training costs and decrease operating effectiveness and productivity 
also  if the company would obtain several significant new clients or implement several new  large scale programs  it may need to recruit  hire and train qualified personnel at an accelerated rate 
the company may not be able to continue to hire  train and retain sufficient  qualified personnel to adequately staff new client projects 
because a significant portion of the company s operating costs relate to labor costs  an increase in wages  costs of employee benefits or employment taxes could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
continued war and terrorist attacks or other civil disturbances could lead to economic weakness and could disrupt the company s operations resulting in a decrease of its revenues and earnings 
in march  the united states went to war against iraq and  in september  the united states was a target of unprecedented terrorist attacks 
these attacks have caused uncertainty in the global financial markets and in the united states economy 
the war and any additional terrorist attacks may lead to continued armed hostilities or further acts of terrorism and civil disturbances in the united states or elsewhere  which may contribute to economic instability in the united states and disrupt convergys operations 
such disruptions could cause service interruptions or reduce the quality level of the services that the company provides  resulting in a reduction of its revenues 
in addition  these activities may cause the company s clients to delay or defer decisions regarding their use of the company s services and  thus  delay the company s receipt of additional revenues
