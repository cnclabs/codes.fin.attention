item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for an understanding of avnet and the significant factors that influenced the company s performance during the past three fiscal years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the description of the business appearing in item of this report and the consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  and other information appearing in item of this report 
the company operates on a week fiscal year and  as a result  the fiscal year ended july  contained weeks  the fiscal year ended july  contained weeks and the fiscal year ended june  contained weeks 
there are numerous references to the impact of foreign currency translation in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
over the past three years  the us dollar has weakened significantly in comparison to most foreign currencies  especially the euro which strengthened against the us dollar by roughly from fiscal to fiscal and by roughly from fiscal to fiscal 
when the weaker us dollar exchange rates of the current year are used to translate the results of operations of avnet s subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies  the resulting impact is an increase  in us dollars  of reported results 
in the discussion that follows  we refer to this as the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the company also discloses certain non gaap financial information such as income or expense items as adjusted for the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as discussed above 
management believes that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better assess and understand operating performance  especially when comparing results with previous periods or forecasting performance for future periods  primarily because management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these adjustments to gaap results 
management also uses the non gaap measures to establish operational goals and  in some cases  for measuring performance for compensation purposes 
however  analysis of results and outlook on a non gaap basis should be used as a complement to  and in conjunction with  data presented in accordance with gaap 
subsequent to fiscal on july   the company acquired memec group holdings limited memec  a global distributor that markets and sells a portfolio of semiconductor devices from industry leading suppliers  in addition to providing customers with engineering expertise and design services 
the acquisition of memec is the company s largest acquisition to date  based on sales 
memec s sales for its fiscal year ended december  were billion 
see acquisitions appearing in item of this report and see note to the consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report for further discussion of the memec transaction 
results of operations executive summary avnet s consolidated results for fiscal were driven by two primary trends a softening in the electronics components market served by electronics marketing em  which was more pronounced during the first half of the fiscal year  as certain em customers reduced their inventory levels and a record sales and profit year for technology solutions ts 
the combination of these trends resulted in the company s consolidated sales growing by from fiscal to fiscal nearly one third of this year over year growth in consolidated sales is estimated to have resulted from the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
within em  fiscal sales increased year over year 
this growth rate is down from year over year growth in em s sales in fiscal of as the electronic components industry was first emerging  in fiscal  from the unprecedented economic and industry downturn that began in the company s third quarter of fiscal the current year growth rate in annual sales was lower than in the prior year largely due to the mid cycle inventory correction in the electronics components markets referred to above 
the mid cycle inventory correction began in the final one to two months of fiscal  most prevalent first in the asia region  although the trend spread to the americas and emea regions in fiscal as well 
the result 
table of contents was declining sequential quarterly sales in the first two quarters of fiscal before em returned to sequential quarterly growth in the second half of the fiscal year and sales levels for electronic components returned to levels experienced before the mid cycle inventory correction began 
in contrast  ts s record sales in fiscal grew by as compared with fiscal sales for the computer products group 
this growth rate was basis points higher than the growth in sales in ts in fiscal compared with fiscal  when the industry was emerging from the multi year downturn discussed above 
the current year increase in sales was a result of strength in the small and medium sized business segments served by ts  as well as growth in sales for microprocessors throughout the fiscal year 
geographically  both operating groups grew sales in all three major economic regions in which they operate the americas  europe  the middle east and africa emea  and asia 
positive growth trends for em asia  particularly in the second half of fiscal  are especially encouraging as em asia was the first region to feel the impacts of the mid cycle inventory correction in the electronic components sector 
the growth in the second half of the fiscal year  coupled with positive trends in customer bookings in all regions  are encouraging signs for continued growth in em 
these trends helped em asia yield its seventh consecutive year of record annual sales 
the asia region exhibited the largest percentage growth for ts  which represents a significant ongoing strategic opportunity for the company s computer products group but is the smallest region for ts  with asia sales accounting for less than of ts s consolidated sales 
the americas and asia regions of ts both achieved record annual sales in fiscal  bolstered by strong server and software sales in the americas and strong microprocessor sales in asia 
although the emea region of ts did not quite post a record regional sales year in fiscal  emea has returned to essentially the same sales levels as fiscal ts s previous highest sales year for the emea region 
avnet s ongoing focus on the management of operating costs and return on working capital have resulted in avnet s highest level of operating profits and operating profit margin since before the multi year economic and industry downturn began 
avnet s operating income as a percentage of sales was in fiscal  up basis points from in fiscal fiscal operating expenses also included restructuring and other charges of million  or of sales see restructuring and other charges in this md a for further discussion 
with gross profit margins remaining relatively stable year over year  the company s reduction of ongoing operating costs has been key to the significant improvement in profitability 
as a result  the company s fiscal operating income drop through  which is the percentage of incremental gross profit dollars that drop through to the operating income line before restructuring and other charges  was including the impact of the fiscal restructuring and other charges 
the company also maintained inventory turns for fiscal year at levels comparable to the prior fiscal year 
however  this includes a period of decline in this asset velocity metric in the first half of fiscal year  which was more than offset by the improvement in the second half of the fiscal year as em began to emerge from the mid cycle inventory correction and achieved record quarterly inventory turns by the fourth quarter of fiscal ts also maintained high levels of working capital productivity even after the computer business s typical seasonal peak in avnet s second fiscal quarter 
operating efficiency and working capital management will remain a key focus of avnet s overall value based management initiatives and its efforts to continue growing profitability and return on capital at a faster rate than its growth in revenues 
it is difficult for the company  as a distributor  to forecast the material trends of the electronic component and computer product industry  aside from some of the normal seasonality discussed herein  because avnet does not typically have material forward looking information available from its customers and suppliers beyond approximately three to four months of forecast information 
as such  management relies on the publicly available information published by certain industry groups and other related analyses in evaluating its business plans in the longer term 

table of contents sales the tables below provide a year over year summary of sales for the company and its operating groups three year analysis of sales by operating group and geography years ended percent change july  of july  of june  of to to total total total dollars in millions sales by operating group em ts sales by geographic area americas emea asia pacific avnet s consolidated sales in fiscal were billion  up million  or  over fiscal consolidated sales of billion 
on a per week basis  to normalize the impact of the extra week in fiscal  sales were up in fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal sales were the highest for avnet since fiscal the year in which the multi year downturn in the electronic components and computer product industry began 
management estimates that the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates contributed approximately million of this year over year increase in sales 
as indicated in the table above  the year over year growth rate occurred in both operating groups 
em s sales growth was not as significant as in the prior year due to the adverse impact of the previously discussed mid cycle inventory correction  particularly in the first half of fiscal however  ts posted year over year sales growth of 
avnet s sales also grew in all three global regions in which it does business 
em recorded sales of billion in fiscal  up million  or  over em s fiscal sales of billion 
approximately million of this year over year growth is estimated to have resulted from the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
em americas was again em s largest region based on sales 
em americas fiscal sales were billion  up million  or  over fiscal sales of billion 
the mid cycle inventory correction resulted in sequential quarterly revenue declines for em americas in the first half of fiscal however  this impact was more than offset by growth in em americas sales in the second half of the year as the region saw increasing demand and a pickup in booking trends as the year progressed 
em asia posted the most significant growth in sales for em  which were billion  up million  or  over fiscal sales of billion 
this growth yielded em asia s seventh consecutive record for annual sales 
more importantly  the positive growth trend in asia is encouraging as this region was the first to feel the negative impact of the mid cycle inventory correction and also appears to have been the first region to positively emerge from this trend during fiscal em s emea operations yielded the largest year over year percentage increase in sales of from billion in fiscal to billion in fiscal  although em emea was also the most positively impacted by the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to the strengthening of the euro  particularly in the first half of fiscal as a result  management estimates that over of this year over year growth in em emea is a result of the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the remaining growth in em emea s sales is less than in the other regions for em as the electronic components industry in the emea region continues to be impacted by softer demand than the other regions 
however  em emea also began to show improved trends in bookings near the end of fiscal 
table of contents the acquisition of memec  completed subsequent to the end of fiscal  will contribute significantly to the growth of em s operations looking forward to fiscal memec s calendar annual sales of approximately billion were dispersed regionally as follows americas  emea  and asia including japan 
management does not expect any significant loss of sales in any regions as the global operations of memec are fully integrated into avnet during fiscal ts s sales in fiscal were a record billion  up million  or  over fiscal sales of billion 
the americas region sales of billion again accounted for the majority of ts s total sales 
the americas region also accounted for the largest dollar increase in sales  year over year  with sales up million  or  over fiscal sales of billion for ts americas 
this is the second consecutive year where ts americas has grown sales by or more  with the current year growth coming primarily from increased microprocessor sales and growth in ts s enterprise computing business 
ts emea posted sales of billion in fiscal  up million  or  over fiscal sales of billion 
similar to em  the ts operations in emea were more favorably impacted than the other regions by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
after removing the foreign currency impact  ts emea sales in fiscal are estimated to have declined by approximately from fiscal this decline in constant dollars is a result of some softness in emea in the avnet visual and data solutions business  although this softness is offset in part by growth and a return to profitability for ts s enterprise computing division in emea 
ts asia sales of million represented the largest percentage increase for any region of ts  growing by million  or  over fiscal sales of million 
the growth in asia is driven primarily by increased volume in microprocessor sales 
as a result of the factors discussed above  ts grew as a percentage of avnet s consolidated sales in fiscal  constituting of the company s sales in fiscal as compared with in fiscal the regional dispersion of avnet s consolidated sales has remained relatively consistent between fiscal and fiscal the company s consolidated sales in fiscal were billion  up billion  or  over fiscal sales of billion 
this significant sales growth was primarily a result of an electronic component and computer product industry that had emerged  in fiscal  from the industry and economic downturn that began in the company s fiscal additionally  approximately million of this sales growth was a function of the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates between fiscal and fiscal em s sales of billion in fiscal were up million  or  over em s fiscal sales of billion  driven primarily by significant growth in the asia region  foreign currency exchange rate impacts and the emergence from the downturn in the more cyclical electronics components sector as previously discussed 
ts recorded sales of billion in fiscal  which was an increase of million  or  over ts s fiscal sales of billion 
approximately half of this growth was a result of the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the remaining growth in fiscal was a function of increased sales of storage  software and networking products in fiscal  offset in part by the impacts  mostly in the emea region  of the company s decision to exit certain low profit  low return on capital employed business in the second half of fiscal gross profit and gross profit margins avnet s consolidated gross profit in fiscal was billion  which represents a gross profit margin of 
consolidated gross profit in fiscal was billion and gross profit margin was 
the mix of business between avnet s two operating groups impacts the gross profit margin of the company 
the computer product sales of ts typically yield lower gross profit margins  but also a lower capital investment  than the electronic component sales of em 
as a result  the slight increase in percentage of consolidated sales generated by ts in fiscal resulted in a downward impact on avnet s consolidated gross profit margin 
additionally  the softer demand in the electronics component market  particularly in the first half of fiscal during the mid cycle inventory correction  also negatively impacted the company s margins in the current year 
management expects gross profit margins to be more stable in the near term with the increasing demand in the electronic components industry emerging from the mid cycle inventory correction 
furthermore  memec is more of a design chain services oriented business  which yields a slightly higher gross profit 
table of contents margin than avnet 
as a result  the integration of memec s operations into avnet in fiscal is also expected to favorably impact consolidated gross profit margins in the upcoming year 
another key metric measured by the company is gross profit per average employee 
the increase in gross profit dollars combined with a slight decline in average headcount resulting from restructuring efforts in past years see restructuring and other charges in this md a for further discussion has yielded gross profit per average employee in fiscal of approximately  up over when compared with  per average employee in fiscal consolidated gross profit margins in fiscal were  down from in fiscal the regional mix of em s business impacted margin between the two years 
because the business model for em asia yields lower gross profit margins but also a lower operating cost structure than the other regions of em s operations  the significant growth of the em asia s operations  in comparison to the americas and emea regions  contributed to the decrease in gross profit margins between fiscal and fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses avnet s consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses were billion  or of sales  in fiscal as compared with billion  or of sales  in fiscal management also monitors the metric of selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross profit 
this ratio was in fiscal  a basis point improvement over in fiscal each of these ratios has improved to its best annual level since before the industry and economic downturn began in fiscal the current year improvement in these key measures of operating leverage is a result of the significant cost reductions that the company has put in place in recent years to manage its overall profitability see restructuring and other charges in this md a for further discussion of the cost reduction actions taken by the company 
selling  general and administrative expenses were negatively impacted in fiscal by an increased level of corporate operating expenses  driven primarily by increased professional fees and related costs associated with the company s sarbanes oxley section compliance efforts 
finally  management estimates that substantially all of the net year over year increase of million in selling  general and administrative expenses  or of fiscal sales  is a result of the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
excluding this impact of foreign currency exchange rates  the company grew its gross profit dollars year over year by over with virtually no increase in operating expense  thereby demonstrating the operating leverage in the business 
the company s focus on the key operating leverage ratios discussed previously  in addition to a focus on returns on working capital  have allowed avnet to continue to post these improvements in operating profitability  even in the face of the mid cycle inventory correction in the first half of fiscal em completed fiscal with a record for inventory turns in the fiscal fourth quarter 
the acquisition of memec will bring a higher level of operating expense dollars in fiscal however  management expects to remove more than million of annualized operating costs from the combined business  largely through headcount  facility and it related synergies 
as a result  management expects the company will be able to maintain positive trends in the operating leverage ratios discussed above as the company moves into fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses of billion in fiscal were of sales as compared with billion  or of sales  in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross profit of in fiscal represented a basis point improvement over the same ratio in fiscal the significant improvement in these metrics between fiscal and fiscal was a more direct impact of the company s restructuring efforts 
specifically  the restructuring efforts completed by the company during fiscal did not fully impact operating results until fiscal fiscal also benefited from a portion of annualized synergies that were realized from restructuring actions taken in the first half of that fiscal year 
partially offsetting the positive impacts of restructuring charges  the fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were negatively impacted by the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates between fiscal and fiscal  which management estimates yielded an increase in fiscal costs of approximately million of fiscal sales and of fiscal gross profits 

table of contents restructuring and other charges the company recorded a number of restructuring and other charges during fiscal and there were no restructuring charges recorded in fiscal the prior year charges relate primarily to the reorganization of operations in each of the three major regions of the world in which the company operates  generally taken in response to business conditions at the time of the charge and as part of the company s efforts to return to the profitability levels enjoyed by the business prior to the industry and economic downturn that commenced in fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report for a more detailed summary of activity within the restructuring and other charge accounts during the past three years 
fiscal although there were no restructuring charges recorded in fiscal  the company recorded certain adjustments to reserves totaling million during fiscal  which were recorded through selling  general and administration expenses 
the adjustments related primarily to the reversal of certain excess legal expense reserves associated with finalization of termination payments and reversal of excess severance reserves  offset in part by additional severance costs recorded based upon revised estimates of required payouts 
the company also reduced certain lease reserves due to modification to sublease and termination assumptions based upon ongoing market conditions 
fiscal during the first and second quarters of fiscal  the company executed certain restructuring and cost reduction initiatives designed to continue improving the profitability of the company 
these actions can generally be broken into three categories the combination of the company s former computer marketing cm and applied computing ac segments into one computer products and services business called technology solutions ts  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report  the reorganization of the company s global it resources  which had previously been administered generally on a separate basis within each of the company s operating groups  and various other reductions within em and certain centralized support functions 
restructuring and other charges incurred during the first quarter of fiscal totaled million pre tax and million after tax  or per share on a diluted basis 
the pre tax charge consisted of severance costs million  charges related to consolidation of selected facilities million  write downs of certain capitalized it related initiatives million and other items  consisting primarily of the write off of the remaining unamortized deferred loan costs associated with the company s multi year credit facility terminated in september million 
severance costs resulted from workforce reductions of approximately personnel completed during the first quarter  primarily in executive  support and other non customer facing functions in the americas and emea regions 
management also identified a number of facilities for consolidation primarily in the americas and emea regions 
these facilities generally related to certain logistics and warehousing operations as well as certain administrative facilities across both operating groups and at the corporate level 
the charges related to reserves for remaining non cancelable lease obligations and write downs to fair market value of owned assets located in these facilities that have been vacated 
management also evaluated and elected to discontinue a number of it related initiatives that  in light of recent business restructurings  no longer met the company s return on investment standards for continued use or deployment 
these charges related to write offs of capitalized hardware and software 
restructuring charges incurred during the second quarter of fiscal totaled million pre tax  million after tax  or per diluted share 
the charges consisted of severance costs million  charges related to write downs of owned assets and consolidation of selected facilities million  write downs of certain capitalized it related initiatives million and other items million 

table of contents severance charges related to workforce reductions of approximately personnel  the majority of whom staffed warehousing  administrative and support functions primarily for facilities within ts emea operations that were identified for consolidation as part of the combination of cm and ac 
a smaller portion of these charges also impacted operations in the americas 
the combination of cm and ac in emea also led to charges related to reserves for remaining non cancelable lease obligations and write downs to fair market value of owned assets located in the facilities that were vacated 
the facilities primarily served in warehousing and administrative capacities 
management also evaluated and elected to discontinue a number of it related initiatives similar to the decisions also reached in the first quarter of fiscal as discussed above 
these charges related to the write off of capitalized hardware and software 
lastly  the company s efforts to combine cm and ac in emea resulted in the decision to merge the former cm emea operations onto the computer systems that have historically been used in the ac emea business 
the change in the use of this significant asset of cm emea generated a need to analyze the group of long lived assets within the former cm emea operations for impairment 
as a result of this analysis  the company recorded an impairment charge to write down certain long lived assets to their estimated fair market values 
this charge  totaling million  of which million relates to the cm emea computer systems that were disposed of  is included in the facilities and it related charges discussed above 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  as part of management s ongoing analysis of the reserves for various restructuring activities  the company recorded adjustments to certain of its remaining reserves 
the adjustments occurred primarily in the company s em and ts operations in emea and related to adjustments to reduce excess severance reserves based upon revised estimates of statutorily required payouts and recording of additional charges related to leased facilities due to modifications to sublease and termination assumptions based upon ongoing market conditions 
the company also negotiated a favorable buyout of a hardware and software maintenance contract  which resulted in the reversal of certain it related reserves 
the net amount of these adjustments was less than million 
the combined charges recorded during fiscal totaled million pre tax and million after tax  or per diluted share 
approximately million of these pre tax charges required the use of cash with the remaining million representing non cash write downs as discussed in greater detail above 
fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  the company executed certain actions as part of its cost reduction initiatives and  accordingly  recorded charges totaling million pre tax  million after tax  or per diluted share 
the charge consisted of severance costs million pre tax  charges related to the consolidation of selected facilities million pre tax and charges related to certain it related initiatives million pre tax 
charges related to severance costs and the consolidation of selected facilities were taken in response to the business environment 
during the second quarter of fiscal  management identified a number of facilities in each of the company s operating groups and its corporate functions  which covered each of the company s geographic regions  to be consolidated into other facilities 
the facilities were identified in an effort to combine certain logistics and administrative operations wherever possible and eliminate what would otherwise be duplicative costs 
the charges related to reserves for remaining non cancelable lease obligations  write downs of the carrying value of certain owned facilities to market value and write downs to fair market value of owned assets located in these leased and owned facilities that were vacated 
additionally  workforce reductions at these and other facilities worldwide resulted in the termination of approximately personnel 
the impacted personnel were primarily in non customer facing positions 
the it related charges resulted from management s decision during the second quarter of fiscal to discontinue a number of it related initiatives that represented insufficient benefit to the company if they were kept in service or continued to be developed 
these charges included the write off of capitalized hardware  software and software licenses 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company executed certain additional actions that resulted in charges totaling million pre tax 
the incremental impact of these actions was substantially offset by certain adjustments that the company recorded  also in the fourth quarter of fiscal  primarily relating to 
table of contents certain of the reserves recorded from the restructuring activity in the second quarter of fiscal the new charge activity  mostly for severance and consolidation of selected facilities  related to each of the company s three operating groups and its corporate functions in the americas and emea regions 
the additional census reductions totaled approximately and resulted primarily from em s decision to combine its cilicon and rf and microwave sales divisions  and ts s decision to reduce its participation in certain market segments where profitability of the products in question have not yielded acceptable economic returns to the company 
the fourth quarter adjustments to prior restructuring and other charges reflect changes in estimates from the time the charges and applicable reserves were initially recorded  relating to reserves for severance and for leases and other contractual commitments that were determined to be excessive during the fourth quarter based upon payments made or still to be made and or based upon more favorable than anticipated sublease or lease buyout arrangements  and an adjustment  based upon estimated sales price net of costs to sell as derived from current market studies and comparable sales  of a portion of a write down that was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal related to an owned facility that was vacated and classified as held for sale during that quarter 
approximately million of the million total pre tax charges recorded in fiscal were a result of non cash write downs 
in all periods  to the extent owned facilities  equipment or it related assets were written down as part of these charges  the write downs were to estimated fair value based upon management s estimates of asset value from historical experience and or analyses of comparable facilities or assets 
particularly in the case of it related initiatives  many of the assets were written off entirely as there is no potential to sell the related assets or otherwise realize value of the assets in the business 
in such cases  the assets have generally been disposed of by the company 
status of restructuring reserves as of july   the company s remaining reserves for restructuring and other related reserve activities totaled million 
of this balance  million relates to remaining severance reserves  the majority of which management expects to utilize during fiscal reserves of million relate to contractual lease commitments  substantially all of which the company expects to utilize by the end of fiscal lastly  the company s it related and other reserves  which total million  relate primarily to remaining contractual commitments  the majority of which the company expects to utilize in the first half of fiscal operating income operating income for fiscal was million  or of consolidated sales  as compared with operating income of million  or of consolidated sales  in fiscal operating income in fiscal was negatively impacted by the restructuring and other charges discussed above  which totaled million  or of sales  in the prior fiscal year 
the significant growth of operating income in both dollars and as a percentage of sales is a function of the moderate increase in consolidated sales between the two fiscal years and the reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses discussed previously in this md a 
em s fiscal operating income of million  or of em s sales  was up from operating income of million  or of em s sales in fiscal  as em continued to focus on the management of its cost structure in the face of sales that only grew moderately year over year as a result of the mid cycle inventory correction discussed previously in this md a 
the improvement in operating profitability was more pronounced at ts where operating income in fiscal was million  or of ts sales  as compared with million  or of ts sales in fiscal the stronger improvement in these results was driven by the record sales year for ts  coupled with its continuing efforts to manage ongoing operating costs 
avnet s fiscal consolidated operating income of million  or of consolidated sales  was up from operating income of million  or of consolidated sales  in fiscal both periods were negatively impacted by restructuring and other charges discussed previously in this md a  which totaled million  or of sales  in fiscal and million  or of sales  in fiscal the 
table of contents substantial improvement in profitability from fiscal to fiscal is primarily a function of growth in sales  as the company emerged from the previous economic and industry downturn in fiscal  and as a result of ongoing management of operating costs through the various restructuring actions taken by the company in recent years see restructuring and other charges for further discussion 
interest expense and other income expense interest expense was million in fiscal  down million  or  as compared with interest expense of million in fiscal the reduction in interest expense year over year is due to a combination of reduced total debt outstanding and a lower effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings 
as further described below  the company has used cash and new financings to further repay outstanding debt obligations 
as a result of these actions  the company s total debt outstanding at july  was billion and the average debt outstanding during fiscal was approximately billion 
this is down from total debt outstanding at the end of fiscal and an average debt balance during fiscal of billion and billion  respectively 
the company s overall effective interest rate also declined as a result of two actions 
first  the company repaid in cash  at maturity  its million notes due march  these notes were outstanding for nearly three quarters of fiscal with no comparable interest expense in fiscal additionally  the company paid off million of its notes due february  with the proceeds from its convertible debentures due march   which were issued in march this resulted in a substantial decrease in effective rates between these two obligations year over year 
the remaining million of the notes were paid off in cash at their maturity date during the third quarter of fiscal  which eliminated the remaining interest expense on the notes for the remainder of fiscal these positive impacts on the company s effective interest rate were offset  in part  by short term interest rates that rose throughout fiscal  which results in the company s fair value hedges paying interest at a higher rate 
specifically  from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal  the interest rates on the company s million hedge of its notes and million hedge of its notes each rose by approximately basis points 
see liquidity and capital resources financing transactions for further discussion of the company s financing 
the acquisition of memec  completed subsequent to fiscal  is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s annual interest expense as the company was able to satisfy the cash obligations of the purchase with cash on hand 
simultaneous with the july  close of the acquisition  avnet also repaid  in cash  substantially all of memec s ongoing debt obligations 
certain foreign lines of credit in the asia region represent the only significant remaining debt of memec subsequent to the acquisition by avnet 
interest expense was million in fiscal  down as compared with million in fiscal trends similar to those discussed above drove this downward trend in interest expense 
first  avnet s average debt outstanding was approximately million less in fiscal as compared with fiscal second  avnet s effective interest rate on borrowings was lower in fiscal as a result of the company s tender and early redemption in the third quarter of fiscal of certain public debt obligations that were maturing in the following twelve months 
these tenders and early redemptions were financed by the issuance of million of notes due february  however  with the fair value hedges that the company entered into on this newly issued debt  the resulting effective interest rate was lower than it was on the debt that was retired 
avnet fully repaid  through tender and early redemption in the third quarter of fiscal  its original principal balances of million of notes due august  and million of notes due october  this repayment was financed by the issuance of million of notes due february  in the third quarter of fiscal the company simultaneously executed a fair value hedge of the notes to convert this new debt from a fixed rate of to a variable rate at july  based upon us libor plus a spread 
additionally  the final four months of fiscal were benefited by the previously discussed issuance of the convertible debentures due march  and tender to pay down a portion of the notes due february  other income  net  which includes interest income  was million in fiscal as compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the primary driver of the variations between years is the effect of foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
fiscal and fiscal both contained foreign 
table of contents currency losses which offset a portion of the interest income earned in the respective years on the company s cash and cash equivalent balances 
fiscal results contained a million gain on foreign currency exchange 
the company has an active hedge program in place  which has been applied on a more global basis from fiscal forward 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further discussion 
debt extinguishment costs as discussed further under liquidity and capital resources financing transactions  the company incurred debt extinguishment costs in both fiscal and fiscal associated with the tender and early purchase of a portion of its outstanding publicly traded debt 
in completing these transactions  the company incurred debt extinguishment costs  related primarily to premiums and other transaction costs associated with these tenders and early purchases  which totaled million pre tax  million after tax  or per share on a diluted basis in fiscal and million pre tax  million after tax  or per share on a diluted basis in fiscal income tax provision benefit the company s effective tax rate in fiscal was as compared with in fiscal the mix of avnet s profits amongst its various international subsidiaries with varying statutory tax rates impacts the company s effective tax rates 
continuing improvement in profitability  particularly in the emea and asia regions  has led to effective tax rates substantially lower than the us federal tax rate in fiscal and fiscal similarly  the mix of profits amongst international subsidiaries in fiscal yielded an effective tax rate of on the company s pre tax loss that year  which was also more favorable than the us federal tax rate 
net income loss as a result of the factors described in the preceding sections of this md a  the company s net income was million  or per share on a diluted basis  in fiscal as compared with net income of  or per share on a diluted basis  in fiscal and a net loss of million  or per share on a diluted basis  in fiscal the fiscal results include the negative after tax impact of restructuring and other charges and debt extinguishment costs  discussed previously in this md a  totaling million  or per share on a diluted basis 
the fiscal results similarly include the negative after tax impact of previously discussed charges totaling million  or per share on a diluted basis 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon the company s continuous evaluation of historical results and anticipated future events 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting polices as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgments and estimates 
management believes the company s most critical accounting policies relate to valuation of receivables the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customer defaults 
bad debt reserves are recorded based upon historic default averages as well as the company s regular assessment of the financial condition of its customers 
therefore  if collection experience or the financial 
table of contents condition of specific customers were to deteriorate  management would evaluate whether additional allowances and corresponding charge to the consolidated statement of operations are required 
valuation of inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost first in first out or estimated market value 
the company s inventories include high technology components  embedded systems and computing technologies sold into rapidly changing  cyclical and competitive markets whereby such inventories may be subject to early technological obsolescence 
the company regularly evaluates inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories less marketable 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value and take into account the company s contractual provisions with its suppliers  which provide certain protections to the company for product obsolescence and price erosion in the form of rights of return and price protection 
because of the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding adjustments to the carrying amount of inventories 
additionally  assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions to discontinue certain product lines can impact the decision to write down inventories 
if assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  management would evaluate whether additional write downs of inventories are required 
in any case  actual values could be different from those estimated 
accounting for income taxes management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of the company s net operating loss carry forwards is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
in addition  the company considers historic levels of income  expectations and risk associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing a tax valuation allowance 
should the company determine that it is not able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  an additional valuation allowance may be recorded against the deferred tax assets with a corresponding charge to income in the period such determination is made 
the company establishes reserves for potentially unfavorable outcomes of positions taken on certain tax matters 
these reserves are based on management s judgments and estimates of probable future tax liabilities 
as these estimates are highly judgmental  there may be differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these matters that may result in reversals of reserves or additional tax liabilities in excess of the reserved amounts 
to the extent such adjustments are warranted  the company s effective tax rate may potentially fluctuate as a result 
restructuring  integration and impairment charges the company has been subject to the financial impact of integrating acquired businesses and charges related to business reorganizations 
in connection with such events  management is required to make estimates about the financial impact of such matters that are inherently uncertain 
accrued liabilities and reserves are established to cover the cost of severance  facility consolidation and closure  lease termination fees  inventory adjustments based upon acquisition related termination of supplier agreements and or the re evaluation of the acquired working capital assets inventory and accounts receivable  and write down of other acquired assets including goodwill

table of contents contingencies and litigation the company is involved in various legal proceedings and other claims related to environmental  labor  product and other matters  all of which arise in the normal course of business 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgment or outcome to these matters  as well as the range of potential losses 
a determination of the reserves required  if any  is made after careful analysis by management and internal and  when necessary  external counsel 
the required reserves may change in the future due to developments or a change in circumstances 
changes to reserves could increase or decrease earnings in the period the changes are effective 
the company does not consider revenue recognition to be a critical accounting policy due to the nature of its business in which revenues are generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  these criteria are met upon the actual shipment of product to the customer 
accordingly  other than for estimates related to possible returns of products from customers  discounts or rebates  the recording of revenue does not require significant judgments or estimates 
provisions for returns are estimated based on historical sales returns  credit memo analysis and other known factors 
provisions are made for discounts and rebates  which are primarily volume based  and are generally based on historical trends and anticipated customer buying patterns 
finally  revenues from maintenance contracts  which are deferred and recognized to income over the life of the agreement  are not material to the consolidated results of operations of the company 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting changes and error corrections 
sfas applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle as well as to changes required by an accounting pronouncement that does not include specific transition provisions 
sfas eliminates the requirement in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes  to include the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle in the income statement in the period of change and  instead  requires changes in accounting principle to be retrospectively applied 
retrospective application requires the new accounting principle to be applied as if the change occurred at the beginning of the first period presented by modifying periods previously reported  if an estimate of the prior period impact is practicable and estimable 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not currently anticipate any changes in accounting principle other than the adoption of sfas r discussed below  which has its own adoption transition provision and is therefore not in the scope of sfas as a result  avnet does not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payments sfas r which revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be measured at fair value and expensed in the consolidated statement of operations over the service period generally the vesting period 
sfas r is effective in avnet s first quarter of fiscal at which point the company has now begun to record the expense associated with share based payments to employees 
upon adoption subsequent to fiscal  the company transitioned to sfas r using the modified prospective application  whereby compensation cost is only recognized in the consolidated statements of operations beginning with the first period that sfas r is effective and thereafter  with prior periods still presented on a pro forma basis 
management has not yet quantified what the precise impact of adopting sfas r will be in the first quarter of fiscal and thereafter 
however  the pro forma impacts of expensing share based payments on the periods presented herein are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
management expects that the fiscal pro forma impacts will be a reasonable approximation of the expense associated with share based payments in fiscal in addition  the company will continue to use the black scholes option valuation model to value stock options 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued staff position no 
fsp  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of  which provides guidance for implementing the repatriation of earnings provisions of the american jobs creation act of the jobs act and the impact on the company s income tax expense and deferred income tax liabilities 
the jobs act was enacted in october however  fsp allows additional time beyond the period of enactment to allow the company to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on the company s plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of the repatriation provisions of fsp and expects to complete this evaluation before the end of fiscal the company is performing its evaluation in stages and  at this point  is considering a range between zero and million for potential repatriation 
however  the related range of income tax effects from such repatriation cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas requires that abnormal inventory costs such as abnormal freight  handling costs and spoilage be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized as part of inventory  and requires the allocation of fixed production overhead costs to be based on normal capacity 
sfas is to be applied prospectively and is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb reached a final consensus on eitf issue no 
eitf  the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share 
eitf requires instruments with conversion features that are contingent upon an issuer s stock price to be included in the earnings per share calculation using the if converted method regardless of whether the contingency is met 
however  eitf allows for treasury stock method treatment for any convertible instruments that have provisions requiring cash settlement up to the par value 
eitf is effective for interim and annual periods ending after december  in december  the company made an irrevocable election to satisfy the principal portion of its convertible senior debentures see liquidity and capital resources financing transactions  if converted  in cash 
therefore  the company has applied the treasury stock method for the debentures both prospectively and retroactively for all periods presented 
the adoption of eitf had no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements or earnings per share as the debentures were antidilutive both retrospectively and for the year ended july  in addition  eitf does not require retrospective application for the convertible notes  which matured on september   because the company settled these notes in cash upon maturity 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows the following table summarizes the company s cash flow activities for fiscal  and  including the company s computation of free cash flow and a reconciliation of this metric to the nearest gaap measures of net income and net cash flow from operations 
management s computation of free cash flow consists of net cash flow from operations plus cash flows generated from or used for purchases and sales of property  plant and equipment  acquisitions of operations  effects of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents and other financing activities 
management believes that the non gaap metric of free cash flow is a useful measure to help management and investors better assess and understand the company s operating performance and sources and uses of cash 
management also believes the analysis of free cash flow assists in identifying underlying trends in the business 
computations of free cash flow may differ from company to company 
therefore  the analysis of free cash flow should be used as a complement to  and in conjunction with  the company s consolidated statements of cash flows presented in the accompanying financial statements appearing in item of this report 
management also analyzes cash flow from operations based upon its three primary components noted in the table below net income  non cash and other reconciling items and cash flow generated from or used for 
table of contents working capital 
similar to free cash flow  management believes that this breakout is an important measure to help management and investors understand the trends in the company s cash flows  including the impact of management s focus on asset utilization and efficiency through reductions in the net balance of receivables  inventories and accounts payable 
years ended july  july  june  thousands net income loss non cash and other reconciling items cash flow generated from used for working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents net cash flow from operations cash flow generated from used for purchases of property  plant and equipment cash proceeds from sales of property  plant and equipment acquisition of operations and investments effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents other  net financing activities net free cash flow reduced drawings under accounts receivable securitization program repayment of debt  net net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents non cash and other reconciling items are the combination of depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes  non cash restructuring and other charges  and other  net  in cash flows from operations 
cash flow generated from working capital is the combination of the changes in the company s working capital and other balance sheet accounts in cash flows from operations receivables  inventories  accounts payable and accrued expenses and other  net 
avnet generated operating cash flows of million during fiscal this positive cash flow is largely driven by the company s improved profitability in fiscal  as further discussed in results of operations in this md a  and the generation of cash from its working capital  excluding cash and cash equivalents 
management has continued to focus on improving asset utilization and efficiency since the economic and industry downturn that began in fiscal this focus was enhanced again in fiscal as the company weathered the mid cycle inventory correction in the electronic components sector 
the company s efforts to manage the combined balance of accounts receivable and inventories  net of accounts payable  allowed the company to generate positive cash flows from these working capital components of million in fiscal a significant catalyst for this cash flow has been the company s ability to effectively manage inventory levels throughout its business 
as discussed in results of operations  em achieved record quarterly inventory turns in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a direct result of this effort 
the cash flows associated with purchases and sales of property  plant and equipment remained relatively consistent in fiscal when compared with prior years 
cash expenditures for acquisitions of operations relate to the first quarter fiscal acquisition of dns slovakia  a small computer product distributor  as well as certain legal and other costs incurred in fiscal related to the acquisition of memec  which did not close until after fiscal trends in foreign currency exchange rates shifted in fiscal to generate a net cash outflow as most foreign currencies  particularly the euro  weakened slightly against the us dollar in the second half of fiscal this negative cash flow results from the translation of avnet s cash and cash equivalents held in foreign currencies  which were generally higher throughout the second half of fiscal resulting largely from the combination of the company s higher profitability and working capital management as it emerged from the mid cycle inventory correction 
the combination of these factors yielded net free cash flow in fiscal of 
table of contents million  of which the company utilized million for repayment of debt see liquidity and capital resources financing transactions 
during fiscal  the company generated million of cash and cash equivalents from its operating activities 
a return to profitability in fiscal plus the impacts of non cash and other reconciling items combined to yield cash inflows for fiscal of million 
partially offsetting this amount are cash flows of million used for the company s working capital needs excluding cash and cash equivalents during fiscal the primary driver of this outflow relate to the growth of receivables million and inventory million  net of cash flow generation from accounts payable million and other working capital items million 
these trends in working capital are typical of an up cycle in the electronic components industry as growth in receivables and payables is driven by higher sales and purchasing volumes 
additionally  inventory growth was also expected as the industry moved into an up cycle  especially in the electronic components sector where longer lead times from suppliers and increased demand from customers typically result in the distributor carrying higher levels of inventory 
as a result  em grew inventory in certain products to accommodate the growing levels in demand and in support of customer contractual agreements to purchase certain inventory 
therefore  it is not uncommon to see cash outflows associated with working capital when the company is in the growth phase of an up cycle 
despite the overall increase  the company continued to manage its working capital utilization and efficiency 
within em  where the majority of the inventory increases took place  fiscal inventory turns improved by over fiscal this improvement in turns is driven by a combination of the increased sales and the buildup of inventory only in high demand  and thus  higher volume product lines 
since the industry and economic downturn commenced in fiscal  the company has significantly reduced its capital expenditures as well as its acquisition and investment activity 
however  during fiscal  the company completed a contingent purchase price payment associated with its january acquisition of of the stock of eurotronics bv  which went to market as sei 
pursuant to the terms of the share purchase agreement  in fiscal  avnet paid million to former shareholders of eurotronics bv in final settlement of contingent consideration related to this acquisition 
this coupled with other  less significant contingent purchase price payments and the acquisition of a minority interest in one of the company s foreign subsidiaries resulted in total cash outflow for acquisitions and investments of million during fiscal these outflows for investing activities  offset in part by the favorable impact of foreign currency on cash and cash equivalents and other financing activities  yielded a net free cash flow of million 
this net free cash flow  coupled with the cash usage for the company s retirement  both early and at maturity  of certain of the company s debt net of proceeds from new debt issued during fiscal see liquidity and capital resources financing transactions  resulted in a net decrease in cash during fiscal of million 
in fiscal  cash flow of million was generated from the combination of the company s net loss and non cash and other reconciling items  and million was generated by reductions in working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents  thus generating net cash flow from operations of million 
the positive cash flow generated from working capital reductions resulted from the company s continued efforts to improve its asset utilization and efficiency  primarily through reductions of receivables cash inflow of million and inventories cash inflow of million  in what continued to be a stable but weak electronic components and computer products distribution industry during fiscal in addition to cash flow from operating activities in fiscal  million was needed for other business operations including purchases of property  plant and equipment  net of cash proceeds from sales of property  plant and equipment  and cash generated from other items  including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the company s cash and cash equivalents 
the company also used million for acquisitions of operations and investments primarily contingent purchase price payments during fiscal  to yield net free cash flow in fiscal of million 
a total of million of this free cash flow was used to reduce the company s borrowings under its accounts receivable securitization program in addition to the retirement of certain of the company s long term debt  net of proceeds from new debt issued during fiscal  resulting in a million increase in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 
table of contents capital structure the company uses a variety of financing arrangements  both short term and long term  to fund its operations 
the company also uses diversified sources of funding so that it does not become overly dependent on one source and to achieve lower cost of funding through these different alternatives 
these financing arrangements include public bonds  short term and long term bank loans and an accounts receivable securitization program 
for a detailed description of the company s external financing arrangements outstanding at july   please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
the following table summarizes the company s capital structure as of the end of fiscal with a comparison with the end of fiscal july  of total july  of total capitalization capitalization dollars in thousands short term debt long term debt total debt shareholders equity total capitalization long term debt in the above table includes a fair value adjustment increasing total debt and capitalization by million and million at july  and july   respectively 
the fair value adjustment relates to the interest rate hedges on the company s notes and notes discussed in financing transactions 
financing transactions in august  the company issued million of senior notes due september  the notes 
the proceeds from the offering  net of discount and underwriting fees  totaled million 
these proceeds were used to launch a tender offer to purchase up to million of the company s notes due november  the notes at a price of  per  principal amount of notes 
the tender offer period closes on september  in august  the company also amended its accounts receivable securitization program which  among other things  now provides that financing under the facility no longer qualifies as off balance sheet financing see off balance sheet arrangements 
as a result  the receivables and related debt obligation will remain on the company s consolidated balance sheet when amounts are drawn on the facility 
during fiscal  the company repaid the remaining million of the convertible notes upon maturity on september  and repaid the remaining million of the notes upon maturity on february  in march  the company issued million of convertible senior debentures due march  the debentures 
the debentures are convertible into avnet common stock  at a rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of debentures 
the debentures are only convertible under certain circumstances  including if i the closing price of the company s common stock reaches per share subject to adjustment in certain circumstances for a specified period of time  ii the average trading price of the debentures falls below a certain percentage of the conversion value per debenture for a specified period of time  iii the company calls the debentures for redemption  or iv certain corporate transactions  as defined  occur 
upon conversion  the company will deliver cash in lieu of common stock as the company made an irrevocable election in december to satisfy the principal portion of the debentures  if converted  in cash 
the company may redeem some or all of the debentures for cash any time on or after march  at the debentures full principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
holders of the debentures may require the company to purchase  in cash  all or a portion of 
table of contents the debentures on march     and  or upon a fundamental change  as defined  at the debentures full principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
the proceeds from the issuance of the debentures  net of underwriting fees  were million 
the company used these proceeds to fund the tender and purchase of million of its notes due february  the company incurred debt extinguishment costs of million pre tax  million after tax and per share on a diluted basis during fiscal related primarily to premiums and other transaction costs associated with this tender and early redemption 
the company has an unsecured  three year million credit facility with a syndicate of banks the credit facility  which expires in june the company may select from various interest rate options  currencies and maturities under the credit facility 
the credit facility contains certain covenants  all of which the company was in compliance with as of july  there were no borrowings under the credit facility at july  or july  in march  the company also repaid in cash its million of notes that matured on march  at july   the company had two interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of million in order to hedge the change in fair value of the notes related to fluctuations in interest rates 
these contracts were classified as fair value hedges and were to mature in november the interest rate swaps modified the company s interest rate exposure by effectively converting the fixed rate on the notes to a floating rate at july  based on three month us libor plus a spread through their maturities 
upon launching the tender offer to purchase up to million of the notes in august  the company terminated the million notional amount of interest rate swaps 
the company has three additional interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of million in order to hedge the change in fair market value of the notes due february  the notes related to fluctuations in interest rates 
these hedges are classified as fair value hedges and mature in february these interest rate swaps modify the company s interest rate exposure by effectively converting the fixed rate on the notes to a floating rate at july  based on three month us libor plus a spread through their maturities 
the hedged fixed rate debt and the interest rate swaps are adjusted to current market values through interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations included in item of this report 
the company accounts for the hedges using the shortcut method as defined under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities 
due to the effectiveness of the hedges since inception  the market value adjustments for the hedged debt and the interest rate swaps directly offset one another 
in addition to its primary financing arrangements  the company has several small lines of credit in various locations to fund the short term working capital  foreign exchange  overdraft and letter of credit needs of its wholly owned subsidiaries in europe and asia 
avnet generally guarantees its subsidiaries debt under these facilities 
off balance sheet arrangements at july   the company had a million accounts receivable securitization program the program with two financial institutions whereby it was able to sell  on a revolving basis  an undivided interest in a pool of its trade accounts receivable 
under the program  the company was able to sell receivables in securitization transactions and retain a subordinated interest and servicing rights to those receivables 
receivables sold under the program were sold without legal recourse to third party conduits through a wholly owned bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that is consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
at july   the program qualified for sale treatment under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfer and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
there were no receivables sold under the program at july  or july  
table of contents in august  the company amended its accounts receivable securitization program to  among other things  increase the maximum available for borrowing from million to million 
the availability for financing under the amended facility is dependent on the level of the company s trade receivables from month to month 
in addition  the program  as amended  no longer qualifies as off balance sheet financing 
as a result  the receivables and related debt will remain on the company s consolidated balance sheet when amounts are drawn on the program 
the purpose of the program is to provide the company with an additional source of liquidity at interest rates more favorable than it could receive through other forms of financing 
the program  as amended  has a one year term  which expires in august covenants and conditions the program agreement discussed above required the company to maintain senior unsecured credit ratings above certain minimum ratings triggers in order to continue utilizing the program 
these minimum ratings triggers were ba by moody s investor services or bb by standard poors 
the minimum ratings triggers were eliminated in the amended program discussed in off balance sheet arrangements and replaced with minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios as defined in the credit facility see discussion below 
the program agreement in effect at july   as well as the amended program agreement also contain certain covenants relating to the quality of the receivables sold 
if these conditions are not met  the company may not be able to borrow any additional funds and the financial institutions may consider this an amortization event  as defined in the agreements  which would permit the financial institutions to liquidate the accounts receivable sold to cover any outstanding borrowings 
circumstances that could affect the company s ability to meet the required covenants and conditions of the agreements include the company s ongoing profitability and various other economic  market and industry factors 
the company was in compliance with all covenants of the program at july  the credit facility discussed in financing transactions contains certain covenants with various limitations on debt incurrence  dividends  investments and capital expenditures and also includes financial covenants requiring the company to maintain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios  as defined 
management does not believe that the covenants in the credit facility limit the company s ability to pursue its intended business strategy or future financing needs 
the company was in compliance with all covenants of the credit facility as of july  see liquidity for further discussion of the company s availability under these various facilities 
liquidity the company had total borrowing capacity of million at july  under the credit facility and the program  against which million in letters of credit were issued under the credit facility as of july   resulting in million of net availability 
the company also had an additional million of cash and cash equivalents at july  approximately million of this cash balance  excluding transaction costs  was used to fund the acquisition of memec and paydown of substantially all of memec s outstanding debt obligations  including related expenses  subsequent to fiscal see acquisitions in item and note to the consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
also subsequent to fiscal  the company contributed million to its defined benefit pension plan 
there are no significant financial commitments of the company outside of normal debt and lease maturities as disclosed in long term contractual obligations 
even with the usage of cash for the memec acquisition  management believes that avnet s borrowing capacity  its cash availability and the company s expected ability to generate operating cash flows are sufficient to meet its projected financing needs 
as discussed more fully in cash flows  the company is less likely to generate positive cash flows from working capital reductions during an up cycle in the electronic components and computer products industry 
however  additional cash requirements for working capital are generally expected to be offset by the operating cash flows generated by the company s enhanced profitability model resulting from the company s significant cost reductions achieved in recent years 
furthermore  subsequent to fiscal year end  the company made a tender offer to repurchase up to million of the million notes  which is the company s next significant public debt maturity 

table of contents the company is funding the tender to repurchase the notes with the proceeds from the august issuance of million in notes  which do not mature until september  the following table highlights the company s liquidity and related ratios for the past two years comparative analysis liquidity years ended july  july  percentage change dollars in millions current assets quick assets current liabilities working capital total debt total capital total debt plus total shareholders equity quick ratio working capital ratio debt to total capital the single biggest driver of the company s growth in current assets year over year is the net cash flow generation of million during fiscal the company s accounts receivable balance also grew year over year  commensurate with the moderate growth in sales in fiscal however  the growth in accounts receivable was more than offset by reductions in inventory  as a function of the company s previously discussed working capital management initiatives  and other assets 
as a result  quick assets cash and cash equivalents plus accounts receivable grew at a greater rate than current assets 
current liabilities grew at a lesser rate year over year as growth in accounts payable also a function of the moderate increase in sales and  thus  purchasing activity in fiscal was offset in part by the pay down of certain current debt maturities see financing transactions during fiscal these trends in the company s current assets and liabilities combined to generate a increase in working capital year over year 
at july   quick assets were greater than the company s current liabilities by million as compared with million at july  working capital increased to billion at the end of fiscal as compared with billion at the end of the prior year 
long term contractual obligations the company has the following contractual obligations outstanding as of july  in millions due in less than due in due in due after total year years years years long term debt  including amounts due within one year operating leases at july   the company has five interest rate swaps outstanding on two of its fixed rate debt instruments which have yielded a fair value adjustment of million to the company s long term debt included in the consolidated balance sheet at july  the issuance of the million notes due in subsequent to fiscal  with the net proceeds used to fund the purchase of up to million of the notes due in see financing transactions  will result in a shift of approximately million between the year maturity group and the after year maturity group in the table above 
the company does not currently have any material commitments for capital expenditures 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company seeks to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into financial arrangements intended to provide a hedge against all or a portion of the risks associated with such volatility 
the company continues to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged 
the company has used interest rate swaps that convert certain fixed rate debt to variable rate debt  effectively hedging the change in fair value of the fixed rate debt resulting from fluctuations in interest rates 
at july   the company had five interest rate swaps outstanding under which the company pays a variable interest rate and receives a fixed interest rate 
the following tables set forth the scheduled maturities of the company s debt outstanding at july  and the total fair value generally based on quoted market prices of the debt outstanding at july  and july  dollars in millions fiscal year thereafter total liabilities fixed rate debt floating rate debt interest rate swaps fixed to variable notional amounts as discussed in financing transactions  subsequent to fiscal  the company initiated a tender offer to purchase up to million of the notes  which are included in the fiscal maturities in the table above 
the company financed this tender through the issuance of million of notes  which are not due to mature until fiscal additionally  million notional amount of the interest rate swaps reflected in the table below were terminated in august as a result of this tender for the underlying debt 
carrying carrying value at fair value at value at fair value at july  july  july  july  liabilities fixed rate debt average interest rate floating rate debt average interest rate interest rate swaps fixed to variable average pay rate libor libor average receive rate many of the company s subsidiaries  on occasion  purchase and sell products in currencies other than their functional currencies 
this subjects the company to the risks associated with the fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates 
the company reduces this risk by utilizing natural hedging offsetting receivables and payables as well as by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments  primarily forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities of less than sixty days 
the company adjusts all foreign denominated balances and any outstanding foreign exchange contracts to fair market value through the consolidated statements of operations 
therefore  the market risk related to foreign exchange contracts is offset by changes in valuation of the underlying items being hedged 
the asset or liability representing the fair value of foreign exchange contracts is classified in the captions other current assets or accrued expenses and other  as applicable  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
a hypothetical change in currency exchange rates under the contracts outstanding at july  would result in an increase or decrease of approximately million to the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts  which would generally be offset by an opposite effect on the related hedged positions
