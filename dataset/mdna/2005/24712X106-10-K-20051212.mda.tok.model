item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read together with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those discussed in factors affecting results of operations and elsewhere in this report 
overview the company returned to profitability in fiscal following losses in fiscal and we improved operating income to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and net income to per share this year from a loss of per share last year  on slightly lower sales levels through expense management 
we also improved our balance sheet during fiscal  reducing our inventory levels by million and lowering our debt by million 
net sales declined by in fiscal compared with fiscal  and in fiscal compared with fiscal  after strong growth in each of the four prior fiscal years 
the declines in fiscal and were primarily due to lower equipment sales  which decreased in each of the last four fiscal years due to a continued tight capital equipment market in the printing industry 
net sales from maintenance  spare parts and supplies decreased in each of fiscal and fiscal because the fall off in net sales from maintenance  spare parts and supplies derived from our legacy equipment installations was not replaced by net sales of maintenance  spare parts and supplies from newer equipment installations the cr series and imaggia systems 
after significantly increasing our investment in product development in fiscal  primarily to enhance the speed and print quality of our cr system  which was introduced to the market place in may  we contained our fiscal research and development expenses closer to fiscal levels 
we anticipate increased net sales in fiscal from cr series equipment sales and  to a lesser extent  imaggia equipment sales  and believe that increases in net sales from maintenance  spare parts and supplies for this equipment will more than offset anticipated declines in maintenance  spare parts and supplies revenues from the legacy equipment 
critical accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  product warranties  inventory  allowance for doubtful accounts and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue on printing equipment sales is recognized upon customer acceptance and transfer of risk of loss 
revenue for equipment sales is not recognized when the contract includes a right of return until after the expiration of the right 
discounts  credits and other sales incentive arrangements offered to our customers are accounted for as reductions to revenue at the point the revenue is recognized 
revenue for post shipment obligations  such as training and installation  considered perfunctory as defined under staff accounting 
table of contents bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  is deferred and recognized as the services are performed 
for spare parts and supplies stored at customer sites  we recognize revenue when the customer uses the inventory 
amounts billed to customers under maintenance contracts are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized in income over the term of the maintenance agreement 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue  reporting revenue gross as a principal verses net as an agent  as primary obligor to the manufacturer  we record revenue for pre press or finishing equipment manufactured by others on a gross basis 
freight revenue is recorded on a gross basis and recognized upon shipment 
the related freight costs are recorded as costs of sales 
product warranties we provide a limited warranty on our digital presses  certain licensed software and on proprietary spares and supplies 
our standard equipment warranty commences with installation and extends for a period of days thereafter 
similarly  on proprietary spares and supplies  our warranty is for days from product shipment date 
for certain licensed software  we warrant substantial conformance to documented specifications 
warranty reserves are reviewed quarterly and adjustments are made from time to time based on actual claims experience in order to properly estimate the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
while we believe that the warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
inventory we reduce the stated value of our inventory for obsolescence or impairment in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value  based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
actual future demand or market conditions for inventory may be more or less favorable than projected by management  resulting in more or less favorable margins than projected 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than we project  additional reductions in stated value may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on identification of specific accounts receivable  supplemented by a general allowance of approximately of accounts aged greater than days not otherwise specifically considered 
specific identification of doubtful accounts and determination of the amount of the required allowance involves a degree of judgment based on discussion with our customer support and sales organization  examination of the financial stability of our customers and review of their payment history 
accounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
there can be no assurance that our estimates will match actual amounts ultimately written off 
during periods of downturn in the market for printed materials or economic recession  a greater degree of risk exists concerning the ultimate collectability of accounts receivable due to the impact that these conditions might have on our customer base 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
income taxes in determining the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets  we assess the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions  to realize the benefit of these assets 
we have fully reserved our net deferred tax assets  totaling million and million as of september  and  respectively  recognizing that the company has incurred income tax losses in two of the last four fiscal years and there is no assurance that future years will be profitable 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may record a reduction in the valuation allowance  resulting in an income tax benefit in the consolidated statements of operations 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the valuation allowance quarterly 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our statements of operations as a percentage of net sales and should be read in connection with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented elsewhere in this report 
year ended september  sales maintenance  spares and supplies printing equipment net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development restructuring costs income loss from operations interest expense interest income realized exchange loss unrealized exchange loss gain income loss before income taxes income tax benefit expense net income loss net sales 
our net sales derive from i maintenance  spare parts and supplies  and ii digital printing equipment 
for fiscal  and  net sales from maintenance  spare parts and supplies were million  million and million  respectively 
the year to year decrease in net sales in fiscal compared with fiscal  and in fiscal  compared with fiscal  was primarily due to lower maintenance  spare parts and supplies revenue from our legacy equipment products  only partially offset by maintenance  spare parts and supplies revenue from our newer equipment the cr series and imaggia systems 
net sales of digital printing equipment decreased in fiscal compared with fiscal  and decreased in fiscal compared with fiscal in general  we attribute these decreases to poor economic conditions for capital equipment purchases  which have led customers to postpone purchases of capital equipment for printing 
the decrease in fiscal compared with fiscal was due to flat cr series sales and generally lower sales in all other product categories 
for fiscal compared with fiscal  the decrease was due to significantly lower sales of imaggia systems and legacy products  partially offset by improved sales of roll fed presses 
we sold one imaggia system in fiscal  compared with two in fiscal and five in fiscal unit sales for the cr series system were four systems in fiscal  four in fiscal and five in fiscal we anticipate increased net sales in fiscal from cr series equipment sales and  to a lesser extent  imaggia equipment sales  and believe that increases in net sales from maintenance  spare parts and supplies for this equipment will more than offset anticipated declines in net sales from maintenance  spare parts and supplies for the legacy equipment 
gross margin 
the company s gross margin percentage in fiscal was  compared with and in fiscal and  respectively 

table of contents these gross margin percentages were affected by the following factors the proportion of total net sales derived from sale of maintenance  spare parts and supplies was greater in fiscal than in fiscal  and greater in fiscal than in fiscal as a result of this and the improvement in margins realized on the sale of maintenance  spare parts and supplies  the gross margin percentage trend improved year to year over the three year period 
the gross margin percentage benefited more in fiscal than in fiscal  and more in fiscal than in fiscal  from the sale of equipment inventory that was acquired with the delphax business in december at values in excess of those originally assigned in the final purchase accounting for the acquisition 
the sale of this acquired inventory resulted in margins higher than we would normally expect to achieve from our on going business 
as cited above under critical accounting policies inventory  actual future demand or market conditions for inventory may be more or less favorable than projected by management  resulting in more or less favorable margins than projected 
we incurred significant unabsorbed overhead cost in all three years  approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  we incurred significant unabsorbed overhead cost as a result of winding down the us manufacturing operation and consolidating the manufacturing operation at the canadian facility 
unabsorbed overhead cost in fiscal and resulted from reduced inventory build levels needed to meet demand 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal  and were million  million and million   and of net sales  respectively 
the million decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to lower compensation expenses  approximately of the decrease  and the absence of costs to refinance our debt as in fiscal  approximately of the decrease 
other discretionary spending  in general  was lower in fiscal than in fiscal as a result of continuing cost reduction measures 
the  decrease in these expenses in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to cost reduction efforts to align operating expenses with lower sales volume 
we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal may increase to support the projected growth in total revenues  but at a rate less than the projected total revenue rate of growth 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased  in fiscal compared with fiscal fiscal research and development expenses were  higher than in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses were  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal research and development expenses compared with fiscal was primarily due to purchased materials and components related to the speed and print quality enhancements introduced in the cr in may interest expense 
interest expense in fiscal was million  compared with  in fiscal and  in fiscal although on average the total debt outstanding in fiscal was lower than in fiscal  and in fiscal was lower than in fiscal  the prime interest rate has increased over the three year period 
as of september   and  our effective interest rate on outstanding bank debt was approximately  and  respectively 
our effective interest rate as of september  was higher than as of september  due to the increase in the prime rate 
our effective interest rate as of september  was higher than as of september  and because debt was outstanding with a different lender at higher interest rates relative to prime 
in addition  fiscal and interest expense included  and  respectively  of non cash interest on the convertible subordinated notes convertible notes issued in february as part of a refinancing of the company s debt 
the interest on the convertible notes is paid in the form of newly issued shares of company common stock  which is expensed at the average market price of the common stock over the interest period  along with amortization of original issue discount 
see liquidity and capital resources and note to the consolidated financial statements for more details on the company s debt 
foreign exchange gains and losses 
we incur realized and unrealized transactional foreign exchange gains and losses on currency conversion transactions that are reflected on the statements of operations 
realized and 
table of contents unrealized transactional exchange gains and losses reflect actual and anticipated  respectively  gains or losses recognized as the result of transactions between entities with different functional currencies 
the net transactional exchange losses for fiscal  and were   and  respectively 
the company experiences translational foreign currency gains and losses  which are reflected on the statements of shareholders equity  with gains due to the weakening  and losses due to the strengthening  of the us dollar against the currencies of the foreign subsidiaries and the resulting effect of currency translation on the valuation of the intercompany accounts and certain assets of the subsidiaries  which are denominated in us dollars 
we anticipate continuing to have transactional and translational foreign exchange gains or losses from foreign operations in the future  although strategies to reduce the magnitude of the gains or losses will be reviewed and implemented whenever economical and practical 
income taxes 
for fiscal  we recorded an income tax benefit of  comprised of a  income tax credit against future income taxes in france  refundable after five years if not utilized  recognized in the fourth quarter  offset by applicable minimum taxes 
for fiscal  we recorded income tax expense of  due to applicable minimum taxes 
for fiscal  we recorded an income tax expense of  as a result of foreign sourced income 
we fully reserved our net deferred tax assets  totaling million and million as of september  and  respectively  recognizing that the company has incurred income tax losses in two of the last four fiscal years and there is no assurance that future years will be profitable 
net income loss 
net income was  or per share in fiscal  compared with a net loss of  or per share in fiscal the  improvement in net income was primarily due to improved income from operations  the result of bringing operating expenses in line with current net sales levels 
interest expense was higher in fiscal compared with as a result of higher interest rates on lower average debt levels  and foreign exchange losses in fiscal were more than double fiscal levels 
in addition  the  refundable income tax credit recognized in france improved earnings per share by approximately 
net losses were  or per share in fiscal  compared with net losses of million or per share in fiscal operating expenses in total were approximately  lower in fiscal than in fiscal when the company also incurred a million expense associated with the december restructuring 
in addition  the significantly lower net loss in fiscal was the result of the higher gross margin percentage for fiscal restructuring initiative 
in december  we announced plans to consolidate our north american manufacturing and engineering operations at our canadian subsidiary 
these operations were divided between the facilities in the united states and canada 
the company s corporate headquarters and marketing function continued to be based in the united states 
the selling and customer support functions continued unchanged in the united states  as well as in the subsidiaries in the united kingdom and france 
we incurred approximately million in restructuring expenses over the course of the consolidation 
these restructuring expenses were wholly comprised of employee severance costs unrelated to the acquisition of the canadian subsidiary and  therefore  were properly charged to operating expense in fiscal  in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
by taking this action  we anticipated eliminating annual operating expenses of approximately million while improving the company s ability to provide customer service and fulfill future orders 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources in february  we refinanced our outstanding debt by borrowing million from a new lender and issuing million in convertible subordinated notes the convertible notes accompanied by warrants to purchase company common stock 
the convertible notes have a four year maturity and bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum  which is paid by the company issuing  shares of common stock quarterly 
the number of shares issued each quarter is fixed  but the recorded interest expense for the issuance of these shares varies from quarter to quarter because it is measured at the average closing price of our common stock during the quarter 
the senior credit facilities are secured by substantially all the assets of the company and the convertible notes are unsecured 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more details on the company s debt 

table of contents our ability to borrow under the senior credit facilities depends on maintaining a borrowing base of eligible accounts receivable and  to a lesser extent  eligible inventory and complying with financial covenants concerning tangible net worth  debt service coverage  interest coverage and maximum capital expenditures 
if the company is unable to generate a sufficient borrowing base and comply with the financial covenants and other requirements of the credit facilities  it will limit or prevent borrowing under the credit facility and could have a serious adverse effect on the company 
debt  excluding capital leases  totaled approximately million and million as of september  and  respectively  as detailed below september  september  balance available balance available outstanding credit outstanding credit in thousands senior credit facilities term loans revolving loans  million limit lines of credit united kingdom france total bank credit facilities convertible notes  million issued at a discount of million amortized over the year term of the loan total debt  excluding capital leases at september   we had credit available under the bank credit facilities of million more than the debt outstanding as of that date 
we believe but cannot assure that funds sufficient to meet our operating needs through fiscal will be available to us under our existing credit arrangements 
accounts receivable decreased to million at september   from million at september   primarily due to timing of collections in fiscal compared with fiscal inventory levels decreased by million in fiscal  to million at september   from million at september  this decrease was split between finished goods inventory and raw materials and component parts inventory  resulting from sales of finished units in inventory and the managed reduction of raw materials and component parts quantities on hand 
cash and cash equivalents decreased from million at september   to  as of september  due to reduced immediate cash requirements 
bank debt balances were reduced from million at the beginning of the year  to million at the end of the year  and accounts payable were reduced from million at september   to million at september  accrued compensation decreased from million at september   to million at september   due primarily to the timing of the last payroll in september no significant capital investment was undertaken in fiscal or is planned in fiscal  and at september   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
we anticipate the move of the corporate headquarters in the third quarter of fiscal  but expect the half year occupancy savings resulting from the move to a smaller facility to partially offset the moving costs 
we expect higher equipment sales levels in fiscal compared with  led by sale of the cr series presses 
net sales from maintenance  spare parts and supplies from new equipment installations in fiscal are expected to exceed the erosion in maintenance  spare parts and supplies sales from our legacy equipment 
in general  we anticipate that the gross margin percentage for fiscal will be lower than for fiscal as we expect to derive a greater proportion of fiscal revenues from the sale of equipment 
we anticipate  but cannot assure  having cash flow from operations in fiscal and that a substantial portion of that cash flow  if achieved  would be used to repay debt 

table of contents new pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  on december  this statement requires the compensation cost related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in a company s financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
we will adopt sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal because we use stock options as employee incentives  adoption of this new standard will have a significant impact on our financial results 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 inventory costs sfas 
the provisions of this statement become effective for the company in fiscal sfas amends the existing guidance on the recognition of inventory costs to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
existing rules indicate that under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 
sfas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the valuation of inventory or financial results
