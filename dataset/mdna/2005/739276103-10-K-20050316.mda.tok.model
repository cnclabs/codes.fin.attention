item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and operating results 
this report includes a number of forward looking statements 
the use of such words and phrases as will  expect  believe  should  anticipate  outlook  if  future and similar words and phrases identify forward looking statements 
such statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and our potential financial performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results and financial position to differ materially from what we say in this report 
these factors include  but are not limited to  our ability to maintain and establish strategic relationships  the risks inherent in the development and delivery of complex technologies  our ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  the emergence of new markets for our products and services  and our ability to compete in those markets based on timeliness  cost and market demand  and our limited financial resources 
we make these forward looking statements based upon information available on the date hereof  and we have no obligation and expressly disclaim any such obligation to update or alter any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information or otherwise 
we more fully discuss these and other risk factors in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and operating results factors that may affect future results of operations and elsewhere in this report 
overview we design  develop  manufacture and market proprietary  high voltage  analog ics for use primarily in electronic power supplies  also known as switched mode power supplies or switchers 
these ics are used in a wide variety of electronics products primarily for the communications  consumer  computer and industrial electronics markets 
our strategy is to continue to diversify into new markets and to expand our existing customer base 
we believe we can achieve our goals by continuing to develop products  that are more energy efficient and have increased functionality  and by continuing to focus on cost reduction strategies to remain price competitive 
our net revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our business is characterized by short term orders and short customer lead times 
customers typically can cancel or reschedule orders without significant penalty 
we plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
total operating expenses in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
for  we expect our operating expenses to increase significantly due to the implementation of sfas no 
r as described below in recently issues accounting pronouncements beginning in the third quarter of  the legal costs associated with our patent infringement lawsuits against system general and fairchild as described in part i  item  legal proceedings  and the addition of resources to research and development  and sales and marketing 
our quarterly and annual operating results are volatile and difficult to predict 
our net revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past  are difficult to forecast and are subject to numerous factors both within and outside of our control 
as a result  our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future 
for a discussion of the factors that may affect our quarterly and annual operating results  please see factors that may affect future results of operations 
we license certain technologies and grant limited product manufacturing and marketing rights to matsushita in return for the foundry relationship  license fees and product royalty arrangements 
license fees and royalties consist of royalties on products shipped by matsushita incorporating licensed technology  and have accounted for a small percentage of our net revenues 
we expect this trend to continue in a portion of our cost of revenues consists of the cost of wafers 
the contract prices to purchase wafers from matsushita and oki are denominated in japanese yen 
the agreements with both vendors allow for mutual sharing of the impact of the exchange rate fluctuation between japanese yen and the us dollar 
nevertheless  changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the japanese yen subject our gross profit and operating results to the potential for material fluctuations 
our agreement to purchase wafers from zmd is denominated in us dollars 
we began purchasing wafers from zmd at the end of

index to financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  estimating sales returns and allowances  estimating distributor pricing credits  estimating allowance for doubtful accounts  estimating reserve for excess and obsolete inventory  and income taxes 
our critical accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
a brief description of these critical accounting policies is set forth below 
for more information regarding our accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  sales returns  allowance for distributor pricing credits  bad debts and inventories 
we base our estimates on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable at the time the estimates are made 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition product revenues consist of sales to oems  merchant power supply manufacturers and distributors 
shipping terms to international oems and merchant power supply manufacturers are delivered at frontier  which is commonly referred to as daf 
as such  title to the product passes to the customer when the shipment reaches the destination country and revenue is recognized upon the arrival of our product in that country 
prior to  title to our products passed to the customer upon shipment from our facilities fob point of origin and as such revenue was recognized upon shipment for all oems and merchant power supply manufacturers 
sales to north american oems and merchant power supply manufacturers are still recognized upon shipment  as this is when the title is passed to the customer 
historically  approximately to of our total sales have been made to distributors pursuant to agreements that allow certain rights of return and protection against subsequent price declines on our products held by these distributors 
as a result  we defer the recognition of revenue and the costs of revenues derived from sales to distributors until such distributors resell our products to their customers 
we determine the amounts to defer based on the level of actual inventory on hand at our distributors as well as inventory that is in transit to them 
the gross profit that is deferred as a result of this policy is reflected as deferred income on sales to distributors in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
estimating sales returns and allowances net revenue consists of product revenue reduced by estimated sales returns and allowances 
to estimate sales returns and allowances  we analyze  both when we initially establish the reserve  and then each quarter when we review the adequacy of the reserve  the following factors historical returns  current economic trends  levels of inventories of our products held by our customers  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
this reserve represents a reserve of the gross margin on estimated future returns and is reflected as a reduction to accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
increases to the reserve are recorded as a reduction to net revenue equal to the expected customer credit memo and a corresponding credit is made to cost of sales equal to the estimated cost of the returned product 
the net difference  or gross margin  is recorded as an addition to the reserve 
because the reserve for sales returns and allowances is based on our 
table of contents 
index to financial statements judgments and estimates  particularly as to future customer demand and acceptance of our products  our reserves may not be adequate to cover actual sales returns and other allowances 
if our reserves are not adequate  our future net revenues could be adversely affected 
estimating distributor pricing credits historically  approximately to of our total sales have been made to distributors 
frequently  distributors need a cost lower than the standard distribution price to win business 
in these circumstances  the distributor submits a request to us for a lower sell in price on a specific end customer transaction or a series of transactions 
after the distributor ships product to its customer under an approved transaction  the distributor submits a ship debit claim to us to adjust its cost from the standard price to the approved lower price 
after verification by us  a credit memo is issued to the distributor to adjust the sell in price from the standard distribution price to the approved lower price 
we maintain a reserve for these credits that appears as a reduction to accounts receivable in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
any increase in the reserve results in a corresponding reduction in our net revenues 
to establish the adequacy of our reserves  we analyze historical ship and debit amounts and levels of inventory in the distributor channels 
if our reserves are not adequate  our net revenues could be adversely affected 
from time to time we will reduce the distribution list price  as a result  we give our distributors protection against price declines  in the form of credits  on products they hold 
the credits are referred to as price protection 
since we do not recognize revenue until the distributor sells the product to its customers  we generally do not need to provide reserves for price protection 
however  in rare instances we must consider price protection in the analysis of reserve requirements  as there may be a timing gap between a price decline and the issuance of price protection credits 
if a price protection reserve is required  we will maintain a reserve for these credits that appears as a reduction to accounts receivable in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
any increase in the reserve results in a corresponding reduction in our net revenues 
we analyze distribution price declines and levels of inventory in the distributor channels 
if our reserves are not adequate  our net revenues could be adversely affected 
estimating allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for losses we may incur as a result of our customers inability to make required payments 
any increase in the allowance results in a corresponding increase in our general and administrative expenses 
in establishing this allowance  and then evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts each quarter  we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers deteriorates  resulting in their inability to make payments  or if we otherwise underestimate the losses we incur as a result of our customers inability to pay us  we could be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts which could adversely affect our operating results 
estimating reserve for excess and obsolete inventory we identify excess and obsolete products and analyze historical usage  forecasted production based on demand forecasts  current economic trends  and historical write offs when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
this reserve is reflected as a reduction to inventory in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  and an increase in cost of revenues 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our assumptions  we may be required to take additional reserves  which could adversely impact our cost of revenues and operating results 
income taxes we recognize federal  state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax authorities 
we also recognize federal  state and foreign deferred tax liabilities or assets for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry forwards and record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence and judgment  are not expected to be realized 
as of december   no valuation allowance had been recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets 
we believe it is more likely than not that forecasted income  including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning 
table of contents 
index to financial statements strategies  will be sufficient to fully recover our deferred tax assets 
in the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future  a valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our result of operations and financial position

net revenues consist of revenues from product sales  which are calculated net of returns and allowances  plus license fees and royalties paid by matsushita 
net revenues increased to million in compared to million in net revenues from product sales represented million and million of net revenues in and  respectively 
our consumer related revenue grew approximately over and accounted for approximately of our net revenue in the growth was driven primarily by an increase in sales of our products incorporated into dvd players  set top boxes  and home appliances of approximately   and respectively 
in  revenues from our industrial market grew approximately  and accounted for approximately of our net 
this revenue increase was a result of strong growth across a variety of applications  including metering and control applications 
revenues derived from the computer market grew approximately from the total revenue increase was partially offset by lower revenues from the communications market  which is dominated by cell phones 
communications revenues declined approximately compared to  driven by a number of factors including weakness in the cell phone market in china  the loss of a portion of samsung s charger business in late to a competing part that we believe infringes on our patents  and price declines due to competition  and the increasing use of lower power chargers  which require lower priced ics 
our product revenue mix for in the end markets that we serve was approximately in the consumer category  in the communications category  in the computer category  in the industrial electronics category and in the other category 
revenue mix by product family in was approximately from tinyswitch i and ii  from topswitch fx and gx  from topswitch i and ii  and from link switch and dpa switch combined 

table of contents 
index to financial statements customer demand for our products can change quickly and unexpectedly 
our customers perceive that our products are readily available and typically order only for their short term needs 
our revenue levels are highly dependent on the amount of new orders that we receive for which product can be delivered by us within the same period 
orders that are booked and shipped within the same period are called turns business 
because of the uncertainty of customer demand  and the short lead time environment and high turns business  it is difficult to predict future levels of revenues and profitability 
international sales were million in compared to million in  representing approximately and of net revenues in those respective periods 
although the power supplies using our products are designed and distributed worldwide  most of these power supplies are manufactured in asia 
as a result  sales to this region were and of our net revenues for and  respectively 
we expect international sales to continue to account for a large portion of our net revenues 
direct sales for were divided to distributors and to oems  and merchant power supply manufacturers  compared to to distributors and to oems and merchant power supply manufacturers for in  two customers  both of whom are distributors  each accounted for approximately of net revenues 
in  the same two customers accounted for approximately and of net revenues 
cost of revenues  gross profit 
gross profit is equal to net revenues less cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues consists primarily of costs associated with the purchase of wafers from various foundries the assembly and packaging of our products by sub contractors  internal labor and overhead associated with the testing of both wafers and packaged components and testing of packaged components by sub contractors 
gross profit was million  or of net revenues  in  compared to million  or of net revenues  in the decline in gross margin was due primarily to higher wafer costs caused by the strengthening of the japanese yen compared to the dollar 
we expect our gross profit margin to remain relatively flat in the first half of compared with the full year  but if pricing pressures from our customers increase as a result of an economic slowdown or for other reasons  or if the japanese yen continues to strengthen  our gross profit could be lower 
in the second half of  we expect our gross margin to decline as a result of the implementation of sfas no 
r in the third quarter 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  and expensed material and facility costs associated with the development of new processes and new products 
we also expense prototype wafers and mask sets related to new products as research and development costs until new products are released to production 
research and development expenses were million  or of net revenues  in  compared to million  or of net revenues  in in absolute dollars  research and development expense remained relatively flat from period to period 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in  primarily as a result of the implementation of sfas no 
r in the third quarter  but depending on our ability to sell our products in the current economic environment  such expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our net revenues 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  commissions to sales representatives and facilities expenses  including expenses associated with our regional sales and support offices 
sales and marketing expenses were million  or of net revenues  in  compared to million  or of net revenues  in in absolute dollars  sales and marketing expenses for were relatively flat from we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in due primarily to the implementation of sfas no

general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses for administration  finance  human resources and general management  as well as consulting  professional services  legal and auditing expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million  or of net revenues  in  compared to million  or of net revenues  in the increase in absolute dollars in general and administrative expenses for was attributable primarily to increases in professional and legal services incurred

table of contents 
index to financial statements particular  section of that act  which requires documentation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in due to the implementation of sfas no 
r in the third quarter  the legal expenses associated with our recently filed patent infringement claims against system general and fairchild  and our ongoing efforts to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
however  these expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our net revenues depending on the sales levels we are able to achieve given current economic conditions 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  was million in and million in the increase was due primarily to increases in cash and investments and slightly higher interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes for and represents federal  state and foreign taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million for compared to million for our estimated effective tax rate used for was  excluding a million tax benefit we recognized in the third quarter 
the estimated effective tax rate used for was also 
the difference between the federal statutory rate of and our effective tax rate used for of is primarily due to the beneficial impact of lower income tax rates on international sales  research and development credits  a benefit of million resulting from a reduction in our estimated income tax liabilities due to the favorable conclusion of certain tax contingencies  and federal tax exempt investments 
we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately in we believe the rate will decline over time if we are able to grow our international business 
comparison of years ended december  and net revenues 
net revenues increased to million in compared to million in net revenues from product sales represented million and million of net revenues in and  respectively 
our non cell phone related revenues grew approximately over revenues from our consumer market grew approximately and comprised approximately of our net revenue 
this growth was primarily driven by an increase of approximately in revenues from sales of our products incorporated into dvd players  the nearly doubling of our revenue from sales of our products incorporated into set top boxes  and an increase of approximately in revenue from sales of our products incorporated into home appliances

net revenues increased in the first three quarters of  and then remained relatively flat  or decreased  over the next five quarters 
the decrease in net revenues in the last half of was due primarily to decreases in demand for our products  primarily in the communications end market 
the decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our products in the consumer and industrial markets 
our gross profit  as a percentage of net revenues  declined slightly over the first three quarters of  and improved in the fourth quarter of  due to a one time benefit in the amount of approximately  resulting from the reversal of deferred rent due to the purchase of our san jose facilities 
in  our gross profit fluctuated as a percentage of net revenues  declining during the first two quarters of  and recovering slightly in the last two quarters 
these fluctuations were due primarily to the benefit from our continued focus on manufacturing costs reductions  by improving our process technology  and through price reductions from our foundries  offset by increased pricing pressure from customers and the unfavorable currency fluctuation between the dollar and the japanese yen 
research and development expenses remained relatively flat in absolute dollars during the eight quarters presented 
the decrease in the fourth quarter of was primarily from a one time benefit in the amount of approximately  from the reversal of deferred rent due to the purchase of our san jose facilities 
the slight decrease in the fourth quarter of was due primarily to a reduction in engineering materials expense 
sales and marketing expenses remained somewhat stable in absolute dollars during the eight quarters presented as we focused on controlling discretionary spending 
in the fourth quarter of  sales and marketing expenses received a one time benefit in the amount of approximately  from the reversal of deferred rent due to the purchase of our san jose facilities 
in the third quarter of sales and marketing expenses declined slightly as a result of a decrease in accrued executive bonus and commission expenses 
general and administrative expenses generally increased over the eight quarters due primarily to increased use of outside professional services 
the increase in absolute dollars in general and administration expenses for was attributable primarily to increases in professional and legal services incurred

as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in addition  under a revolving line of credit agreement with union bank of california  we can borrow up to million 
a portion of the credit line is used to cover advances for commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit  which we provide to matsushita and oki prior to the shipment of wafers by those foundries to us 
as of december   there were outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately million 
the balance of this credit line is unused and available 
the line of credit agreement contains financial covenants with which we have remained in compliance  and requires that we maintain profitability on a quarterly basis and not pay or declare dividends without the bank s prior consent 
as of december   we had no outstanding capital equipment leases 
as of december   we had working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities  of approximately million  which was an increase of approximately million over december  our operating activities generated cash of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively

the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
as of december   we had commitments through september for our operating lease totaling approximately  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during  a significant portion of our cash flow was generated by our operations 
if our operating results deteriorate in  as a result of decrease in customer demand or severe pricing pressures from our customers or our competitors  our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations may be jeopardized 
in that case  we may be forced to use our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to fund our operations

additionally  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal  beginning on november  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on our results of operations and financial condition  but we do not expect the impact of sfas to be material

eitf  whether an investor should apply the equity method of accounting to investments other than common stock 
eitf addresses whether the equity method of accounting applies when an investor does not have an investment in voting common stock of an investee but exercises significant influence through other means 
eitf states that an investor should only apply the equity method of accounting when it has investments in either common stock or in substance common stock of a corporation  provided that the investor has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee

under sfas r  beginning july   we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include a modified prospective and a modified retroactive adoption options 
under the modified retroactive option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the modified retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r  and expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share

factors that may affect future results of operations in addition to the other information in this report  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business before purchasing shares of our stock 
our quarterly operating results are volatile and difficult to predict 
if we fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors  the market price of our common stock may decrease significantly 
our net revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past  are difficult to forecast  are subject to numerous factors both within and outside of our control  and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
as a result  our quarterly operating results could fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if that occurs  the price of our stock may decline 

table of contents 
index to financial statements some of the factors that could affect our operating results include the following the volume and timing of orders received from customers  competitive pressures on selling prices  the demand for our products declining in the major end markets we serve  continued impact of recently enacted changes in securities laws and regulations  including the sarbanes oxley act of  the inability to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights  changes to generally accepted accounting principles gaap which will require recording compensation expense for employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans  the volume and timing of orders placed by us with our wafer foundries and assembly subcontractors  fluctuations in exchange rates  particularly the exchange rates between the us dollar and the japanese yen  the licensing of our intellectual property to one of our wafer foundries  the lengthy timing of our sales cycle  undetected defects and failures in meeting the exact specifications required by our products  our international sales activities account for a substantial portion of our net revenues  our ability to develop and bring to market new products and technologies on a timely basis  the ability of our products to penetrate additional markets  attraction and retention qualified personnel in a competitive market  the adoption of anti takeover measures  the volatility of the future trading price of our common stock  and earthquakes  terrorists acts or other disasters 
we do not have long term contracts with any of our customers and if they fail to place  or if they cancel or reschedule orders for our products  our operating results and business may suffer 
our business is characterized by short term customer orders and shipment schedules 
our customer base is highly concentrated  and a relatively small number of distributors  oems and merchant power supply manufacturers account for a significant portion of our revenues 
the ordering patterns of some of our existing large customers have been unpredictable in the past and we expect that customer ordering patterns will continue to be unpredictable in the future 
not only does the volume of units ordered by particular customers vary substantially from period to period  but also purchase orders received from particular customers often vary substantially from early oral estimates provided by those customers for planning purposes 
in addition  customer orders can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
in the past we have experienced customer cancellations of substantial orders for reasons beyond our control  and significant cancellations could occur again at any time 
intense competition in the high voltage power supply industry may lead to a decrease in the average selling price and reduced sales volume of our products  which may harm our business 
the high voltage power supply industry is intensely competitive and characterized by significant price erosion 
our products face competition from alternative technologies  such as  traditional linear transformers  discrete switcher power supplies  and other integrated and hybrid solutions 
if the price of competing solutions decreases significantly  the cost effectiveness of our products will be adversely affected 
if power requirements for applications in which our products are currently utilized go outside the cost effective range of our products  some of these alternative technologies can 
table of contents 
index to financial statements be used more cost effectively 
we cannot assure that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market 
we believe our failure to compete successfully in the high voltage power supply business  including our ability to introduce new products with higher average selling prices  would materially harm our operating results 
if demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve  our net revenues will decrease 
applications of our products in the consumer  communications and computer end markets  such as cellular phone chargers  stand by power supplies for pcs  power supplies for tv set top boxes and power supplies for home appliances have and will continue to account for a large percentage of our net revenues 
we expect that a significant level of our net revenues and operating results will continue to be dependent upon these applications in the near term 
the demand for these products has been highly cyclical and has been subject to significant economic downturns at various times 
announcements of economic slowdown by major companies in any of the end markets we serve  could indirectly through our customers  cause a slowdown in demand for some of our ics 
when our customers are not successful in maintaining high levels of demand for their products  their demand for our ics decreases  which adversely affects our operating results 
any significant downturn in demand in these markets would cause our net revenues to decline and could cause the price of our stock to fall 
recently enacted changes in securities laws and regulations will continue to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of requires changes in some of our corporate governance practices 
the sarbanes oxley act also requires the sec to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects 
in addition to final rules made by the sec  nasdaq has revised its requirements for companies that are nasdaq listed 
these new rules and regulations have and will increase our legal and financial compliance costs  and make some activities more difficult  time consuming and or costly 
these new rules and regulations also make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these new rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  particularly qualified members to serve on our audit committee  and qualified executive officers 
additionally  our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors audit of the assessment of our internal controls continues to require the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
although we believe that the ongoing review of our internal controls over financial reporting will enable us to provide an assessment of our internal controls and our external auditors to provide their audit opinion  we can give no assurance that such assessment will continue to be successfully completed 
moreover  because these laws  regulations and standards promulgated by the sarbanes oxley act are subject to varying interpretations  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available 
this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices 
if we are unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights  we could lose market share  incur costly litigation expenses  suffer incremental price erosion or lose valuable assets  any of which could harm our operations and negatively impact our profitability 
our success depends upon our ability to protect our intellectual property  including patents  trade secrets  copyrights  and know how  and to continue our technological innovation 
we cannot assure that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or that others will not develop competitive technologies or products 
from time to time we have received  and we may receive in the future  communications alleging possible infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to us  may be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others 
the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or litigation arising out of infringement claims could cause us to lose market share and harm our business 
there can be no assurance that we will prevail in our litigation with either system general or fairchild 
this litigation  whether or not determined in our favor or settled by us  will be costly and will divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
adverse determinations in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements litigation could result in the loss of our proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from licensing our technology  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
moreover  the laws of some foreign countries in which our technology is or may in the future be licensed may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  thus increasing the possibility of infringement of our intellectual property 
changes to gaap that will require recording compensation expense for employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
the fasb recently enacted sfas r  which will require us to adopt a different method of determining the compensation expense of our employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan 
sfas r will have a significant adverse effect on our reported financial conditions and may impact the way we conduct our business 
we depend on third party suppliers to provide us with wafers for our products and if they fail to provide us sufficient wafers  our business will suffer 
we have supply arrangements for the production of wafers with matsushita  which expires in june  we are currently in discussions with them on renewal of our agreement  and with oki  which expires in april although certain aspects of our relationships with matsushita and oki are contractual  many important aspects of these relationships depend on their continued cooperation 
we cannot assure that we will continue to work successfully with matsushita or oki in the future  that the wafer foundries capacity will meet our needs  or that either of them will not seek an early termination of our wafer supply agreements 
any serious disruption in the supply of wafers from either oki or matsushita would harm our business 
we estimate that it would take to months from the time we identified an alternate manufacturing source before that source could produce wafers with acceptable manufacturing yields in sufficient quantities to meet our needs 
in may  we signed a wafer supply agreement with a third wafer foundry  zmd analog mixed signal services gmbh cokg zmd  which is located in germany 
we completed the qualification of zmd as our third foundry partner and began taking delivery of production wafers from zmd during the fourth quarter of our agreement with zmd expires on december  although we provide matsushita  oki and zmd with rolling forecasts of our production requirements  their ability to provide wafers to us is ultimately limited by the available capacity of the wafer foundry in which they manufacture wafers for us 
any reduction in wafer foundry capacity available to us could require us to pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or require us to make other concessions in order to acquire the wafer supply necessary to meet our customers requirements 
any of these concessions could harm our business 
if our third party suppliers and independent subcontractors do not produce our wafers and assemble our finished products at acceptable yields  our net revenues may decline 
we depend on independent foundries to produce wafers  and independent subcontractors to assemble and test finished products  at acceptable yields and to deliver them to us in a timely manner 
the failure of the foundries to supply us wafers at acceptable yields could prevent us from selling our products to our customers and would likely cause a decline in our net revenues 
in addition  our ic assembly process requires our manufacturers to use a high voltage molding compound available from only one vendor  which is difficult to process 
this compound and its required processes  together with the other non standard materials and processes needed to assemble our products  require a more exacting level of process control than normally required for standard packages 
unavailability of the sole source compound or problems with the assembly process can materially adversely affect yields and cost to manufacture 
we cannot assure that acceptable yields will be maintainable in the future 
fluctuations in exchange rates  particularly the exchange rates between the us dollar and the japanese yen may impact our gross margin 
the contract prices to purchase wafers from matsushita and oki are denominated in japanese yen 
the agreements with both vendors allow for mutual sharing of the impact of the exchange rate fluctuation between japanese yen and the us dollar 
nevertheless  changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the japanese yen subject our gross profit and operating results to the potential for material fluctuations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements matsushita has licenses to our technology  which it may use to our detriment 
our ability to take advantage of the potentially large japanese market for our products is largely dependent on matsushita and its ability to promote and deliver our products 
pursuant to our agreement with matsushita  matsushita has the right to manufacture and sell products using our technology to japanese companies worldwide and to subsidiaries of japanese companies located in asia 
although we receive royalties on matsushita s sales  these royalties are substantially lower than the gross profit we receive on direct sales 
we cannot assure that matsushita will not use the technology rights within the restrictions we have granted it to develop or market competing products following any termination of its relationship with us or after termination of matsushita s royalty obligation to us 
because the sales cycle for our products can be lengthy  we may incur substantial expenses before we generate significant revenues  if any 
our products are generally incorporated into a customer s products at the design stage 
however  customer decisions to use our products  commonly referred to as design wins  which can often require us to expend significant research and development and sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success  often precede volume sales  if any  by a year or more 
the value of any design win will largely depend upon the commercial success of the customer s product 
we cannot assure that we will continue to achieve design wins or that any design win will result in future revenues 
if a customer decides at the design stage not to incorporate our products into its product  we may not have another opportunity for a design win with respect to that product for many months or years 
our products must meet exacting specifications  and undetected defects and failures may occur which may cause customers to return or stop buying our products 
our customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality  performance and reliability that our products must meet 
ics as complex as those we sell often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments 
we have from time to time in the past experienced product quality  performance or reliability problems 
if defects and failures occur in our products  we could experience lost revenue  increased costs  including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support  delays in or cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments and product returns or discounts  any of which would harm our operating results 
our international sales activities account for a substantial portion of our net revenues and subject us to substantial risks 
sales to customers outside of the united states account for  and have accounted for a large portion of our net revenues  including approximately and of our net revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
if our international sales declined and we were unable to increase domestic sales  our revenues would decline and our operating results would be harmed 
international sales involve a number of risks to us  including potential insolvency of international distributors and representatives  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  the impact of recessionary environments in economies outside the united states  tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign and applicable us federal and state laws  and foreign currency exchange risk 
our failure to adequately address these risks could reduce our international sales  which would materially adversely affect our operating results 
furthermore  because substantially all of our foreign sales are denominated in us dollars  increases in the value of the dollar increase the price in local currencies of our products in foreign markets and make our products relatively more expensive and less price competitive than competitors products that are priced in local currencies 
if our efforts to enhance existing products and introduce new products are not successful  we may not be able to generate demand for our products 
our success depends in significant part upon our ability to develop new ics for high voltage power conversion for existing and new markets  to introduce these products in a timely manner and to have these products selected for design into products of leading manufacturers 
new product 
table of contents 
index to financial statements introduction schedules are subject to the risks and uncertainties that typically accompany development and delivery of complex technologies to the market place  including product development delays and defects 
if we fail to develop and sell new products in a timely manner  our net revenues could decline 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to adjust to changing market demands as quickly and cost effectively as necessary to compete successfully 
furthermore  we cannot assure that we will be able to introduce new products in a timely and cost effective manner or in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or that these products will achieve market acceptance 
our failure  or our customers failure to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a timely manner would harm our business and may cause the price of our common stock to fall 
in addition  customers may defer or return orders for existing products in response to the introduction of new products 
although we maintain reserves for potential customer returns  we cannot assure that these reserves will be adequate 
if our products do not penetrate additional markets  our business will not grow as we expect 
we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to penetrate additional markets for our products 
we cannot assure that we will be able to overcome the marketing or technological challenges necessary to do so 
to the extent that a competitor penetrates additional markets before we do  or takes market share from us in our existing markets  our net revenues and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition for qualified personnel is intense in our market 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel  and on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  such as experienced analog design engineers and systems applications engineers 
the competition for these employees is intense  particularly in silicon valley 
the loss of the services of one or more of our engineers  executive officers or other key personnel could harm our business 
in addition  if one or more of these individuals leaves our employ  and we are unable to quickly and efficiently replace those individuals with qualified personnel who can smoothly transition into their new roles  our business may suffer 
we do not have long term employment contracts with  and we do not have in place key person life insurance policies on  any of our employees 
we have adopted anti takeover measures  which may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of shares of preferred stock  while potentially providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and for other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we have no present intention to issue shares of preferred stock 
in addition  our board of directors adopted a preferred stock purchase rights plan intended to guard against hostile takeover tactics 
the existence of this plan could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 
the price of our common stock has been  and is likely to be  volatile 
factors including future announcements concerning us  our customers or our competitors  quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations  the introduction of new products or changes in our product pricing policies or those of our competitors  proprietary rights or other litigation  changes in earnings estimates by analysts and other factors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  stock prices for many technology companies fluctuate widely for reasons  which may be unrelated to operating results 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic  market and political conditions may harm the market price of our common stock 
in the event of an earthquake  terrorist act or other disaster  our operations may be interrupted and our business would be harmed 
our principal executive offices and operating facilities situated near san francisco  california  and most of our major suppliers wafer foundries and assembly houses  are located in areas that have 
table of contents 
index to financial statements been subject to severe earthquakes 
in the event of an earthquake  we and or most of our major suppliers may be temporarily unable to continue operations and may suffer significant property damage 
any such interruption in our ability or that of our major suppliers to continue operations at our facilities could delay the development and shipment of our products 
like other us companies  our business and operating results are subject to uncertainties arising out of economic consequences of current and potential military actions or terrorist activities and associated political instability  and the impact of heightened security concerns on domestic and international travel and commerce 
such uncertainties could also lead to delays or cancellations of customer orders  a general decrease in corporate spending or our inability to effectively market and sell our products 
any of these results could substantially harm our business and results of operations  causing a decrease in our revenues

our primary foreign currency cash flows are in asia and western europe 
currently  we do not employ a foreign currency hedge program utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts  however  the contract prices to purchase wafers from matsushita and oki are denominated in japanese yen and both agreements allow for mutual sharing of the impact of the exchange rate fluctuation between japanese yen and the us dollar 
nevertheless  changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the japanese yen subject our gross profit and operating results to the potential for material fluctuations 
we maintain a japanese yen account with a us bank for payments to our wafer suppliers in japan
