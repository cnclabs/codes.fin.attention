item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this report contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
such statements are subject to certain factors which may cause our plans and results to differ significantly from plans and results discussed in forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the section entitled risk factors 
overview we are engaged in the discovery and development of therapeutic products aimed at treating patients with a wide array of severe disease states  including hematologic and cardiovascular disorders  autoimmune diseases and cancer 
since our incorporation in january  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to drug discovery  research  and product and clinical development 
additionally  through our wholly owned subsidiary  alexion antibody technologies  inc  or aat  we are engaged in the discovery and development of a portfolio of additional antibody therapeutics targeting severe unmet medical needs 
our two lead product candidates are therapeutic antibodies that address specific diseases that arise when the human immune system produces inflammation in the human body 
antibodies are proteins that bind specifically to selected targets  or antigens  in the body 
after the antibody binds to its target  it may activate the body s immune system against the target  block activities of the target or stimulate activities of the target 
we are currently examining our two lead antibody product candidates in a variety of clinical development programs 
one product candidate  eculizumab  is in phase iii clinical development for treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria  or pnh  a chronic hematologic disease  and our second product candidate  pexelizumab  is in clinical development for two distinct acute cardiac indications 
we are developing pexelizumab in collaboration with procter gamble pharmaceuticals  or p g  and rely on p g for the timely development and potential commercialization of pexelizumab 
currently  none of our drug product candidates is available for commercial sale 
all of our potential products are in clinical or pre clinical development and the status of each of our lead product candidates is set forth  by indication  in item of this report under the heading product development programs 
successful completion of development of a product candidate is contingent on numerous risks  uncertainties and other factors which are described in detail in the section entitled risk factors 
these factors include completion of pre clinical and clinical trials of the product candidate with scientific results that support further development and or regulatory approval receipt of necessary regulatory approvals obtaining adequate supplies of product candidates on commercially reasonable terms obtaining capital necessary to fund our operations  including our research and development efforts  manufacturing requirements and clinical trials performance of third party collaborators  particularly procter gamble pharmaceuticals  on whom we rely heavily for the co development and commercialization of one of our lead product candidates performance of third party manufacturers  particularly lonza biologics  on whom we rely heavily for the manufacture of one of our lead product candidates obtaining manufacturing  sales and marketing capabilities for which we presently have limited resources 
table of contents as a result of the amount and nature of these factors  many of which are outside of our control  the success  timing of completion  and ultimate cost  of development of any of our product candidates is highly uncertain and cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty 
the timing and cost to complete drug trials alone may be impacted by  among other things  slow patient enrollment  long treatment time required to demonstrate effectiveness  lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate  disruption of operations at the clinical trial sites  adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients  the failure of patients taking the placebo to continue to participate in our clinical trials  lack of effectiveness of the product candidate being tested  and lack of sufficient funds 
if we do not successfully complete clinical trials  we will not receive regulatory approval to market our drug products 
if we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our products  we will not generate any revenues from the sale of our products and the value of our company and our financial condition and results of operations will be substantially harmed 
to date  we have not received any revenues from the sale of products 
we have incurred operating losses since our inception 
as of july   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing operating losses for the next several years due to expenses associated with product research and development  pre clinical studies and clinical testing  regulatory activities  manufacturing development  scale up and commercial scale manufacturing  pre commercialization activities  developing a sales and marketing force  and increasing administrative personnel and professional services to support growth of our operations  and we will need to obtain additional financing to cover these costs 
we plan to develop and commercialize eculizumab on our own and those product candidates for which the clinical trials and commercialization requirements can be funded and accomplished by our own resources 
for those products which require greater resources  such as pexelizumab  our plan is to develop and commercialize the drugs through corporate partnerships 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements and do not guarantee the obligations of any other entity 
we do indemnify certain third parties against liabilities they may incur in connection with the manufacturing  development  or sale of our drug candidates 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates in our preparation of consolidated financial statements  we use certain estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures 
our estimates are often based on judgments  probabilities and assumptions that we believe are reasonable  but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
all of these judgments and estimates can materially impact our result of operations 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements marketable securities we invest in marketable debt securities of highly rated financial institutions and investment grade debt instruments and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity 
unrealized gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders equity 
we believe that our conservative investment policy ensures reasonable assurance against impairment of marketable securities held  and also enables us to avoid incurring realized losses that could occur if securities were not held to maturity 
long lived assets we assess the potential impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider important  and which could trigger an impairment review  include  among others  the following a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used  a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  and a significant decrease in market value of assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable  based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we will compare the carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the group 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  we will then compare the carrying value of the asset group to its fair value to determine whether an impairment charge is required 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  such amount is recognized as an impairment charge 
goodwill goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired businesses and the fair value of their net assets  and is not amortized 
we test goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill might not be recoverable 
no impairment charge resulted upon the adoption of this standard or as a result of the company s annual impairment assessment 
prepaid manufacturing costs cash advances paid by us to secure future long term manufacturing production at third party contract manufacturers are recorded as prepaid manufacturing costs 
these costs are recognized over the period of manufacturing production on a unit of production method 
the cash advances are subject to refund if the manufacturing facility is unavailable as scheduled or forfeiture if we terminate the scheduled production 
we evaluate the prepaid manufacturing costs against estimated net realizable value  or nrv 
if estimated nrv were to be negative  then all or a portion of the prepaid manufacturing cost may have to be recognized as an expense 
our calculation of nrv involves estimates of expected sales volume  sales price and market penetration of the product in question 
revenue recognition we record contract research revenues from research and development support payments  license fees and milestone payments under collaborations with third parties  and amounts received from various government grants 
we evaluate all deliverables in our collaborative agreements to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting 
deliverables qualify for separate accounting treatment if they have standalone value to the customer and if there is objective evidence of fair value for the undelivered items 

table of contents up front  non refundable license fees received in connection with a collaboration agreement are deferred and amortized into revenue over the life of the agreement or underlying technologies 
revenues derived from the achievement of milestones are recognized when the milestone is achieved  provided that the milestone is substantive and a culmination of the earnings process has occurred 
revenues derived from the achievement of milestones or recognition of related work when performed under terms of a contract may cause our operating results to vary considerably from period to period 
research and development support revenues are recognized as the related work is performed and expenses are incurred under the terms of the contracts for development activities 
deferred revenue results from cash received or amounts receivable in advance of revenue recognition under research and development contracts 
research and development expenses research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits  pre clinical  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  manufacturing development and scale up costs  contract services and other outside contractor costs  research license fees  depreciation and amortization of lab facilities  and lab supplies 
theses costs are expensed when incurred 
we have entered into certain research agreements in which we share costs with our collaborator 
we record these costs as research and development expenses as incurred 
a portion of these costs are reimbursed by our collaborator and are recorded as a reduction of research and development expense 
accrued research and development expenses are comprised of amounts owed to suppliers for research and development work performed on our behalf 
at the end of each period  we evaluate the accrued expense balance related to these activities based upon information received from the supplier and estimated progress toward completion of the research or development objectives to ensure that the balance is appropriately stated 
such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available 
stock based compensation we account for stock options and restricted stock utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion  or apb  no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and accordingly  recognize no compensation expense for the options when the option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of grant 
we believe that it is difficult to accurately measure the value of an employee stock option 
our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the black scholes model 
the key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events 
significantly  we use historical volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility factor 
also  of significance  is our expected term until exercise factor 
we currently use historical exercise patterns as our best estimate of future exercise patterns 
once employee stock option values are determined  they may not be changed 

table of contents we continually seek to refine and improve our approach to measure the value of employee stock options 
the issuance of sfas no 
r will significantly change the way we account for grants of stock options 
this new pronouncement and its potential impact are discussed in the section titled recently issued accounting pronouncements 
results of operations a reclassification has been made to the presentation of operating expenses for the twelve months ended july  in order to conform to current year expense classifications 
our connecticut capital based tax in the prior fiscal year was reclassified from state tax benefit to operating expense 
in addition  certain reclassifications have been made to prior year balance sheet items to conform to current year classifications 
fiscal years ended july    and a summary of revenues generated from contract research collaboration and grant awards is as follows amounts in thousands p g us government grants total revenues we earned contract research revenues of million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended july    and  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a million milestone payment from p g concurrent with the dosing of our first patient in the apex ami trial 
substantially all of the other revenue in fiscal years  and is a non cash item representing the amortization of deferred revenue from the million upfront fee paid to us by p g in february revenue from us government grants totaled  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal the  increase in revenues associated with us government grants obtained in fiscal resulted from research under the anti anthrax bio defense program 
the  decrease in revenues associated with us government grants from to resulted primarily from the reduction in grant reimbursable billings from our various government grants due to the completion of the related research 
during fiscal year  we incurred research and development expenses of million 
for fiscal years and  we incurred research and development expenses of million and million  respectively 
we report our research and development costs by category incurred rather than by project 
our research and development costs consist primarily of payroll and benefits costs  pre clinical costs  clinical trial costs and other clinical related development costs  manufacturing development and manufacturing costs  discovery research costs  depreciation and amortization expense  and occupancy related facility operating costs 
the following table summarizes the major research and development expense categories for the fiscal years ended july    and respectively amounts in thousands research and development expenses payroll and benefits clinical development manufacturing and manufacturing development discovery research operating  occupancy  depreciation  and amortization 
table of contents the increase in clinical development expenses from to is attributable principally to the cost of conducting our two phase iii clinical trials primo cabg and apex ami in pexelizumab 
the increase in payroll and benefits from to is primarily attributable to the increase in staff involved in clinical and manufacturing development as well as regulatory and quality assurance activities 
the increase in manufacturing and manufacturing development expenses from to is caused largely by increased production of material used in our clinical trials involving eculizumab and pexelizumab 
the decrease in discovery research is due principally to recognition of the million balance of the non refundable payment received from xoma 
in  xoma paid an upfront non refundable fee of million pursuant to a collaborative agreement 
we recorded the payment as a deferred research and development payment and amortized the payment as a reduction of research and development expense 
upon cancellation of the xoma collaborative agreement in  the remaining balance of million was recognized as a reduction of research and development expenses 
the million decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal from fiscal resulted primarily from i lower clinical development costs of million due principally to the completion of the pexelizumab phase iii primo cabg clinical trial  ii lower costs for discovery research of million due to lower external research and license fees and the suspension of the unigraft program at cfc  and iii lower manufacturing development and manufacturing activities of million resulting from the amended manufacturing agreement with lonza and the timing related to the manufacture of pexelizumab 
these lower expenses are partially offset by increased payroll and benefits costs of approximately million and increased occupancy and depreciation costs of million 
we expect research and development expenses will increase in fiscal due to  among other things  the completion of the primo cabg trial  the continuation of the apex ami trial  the completion of the triumph and shepherd trials and ongoing enrollment into the extension clinical trial with eculizumab in pnh patients 
our general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of million from to was due principally to increased pre commercial activities associated with our two lead product candidates  as well as increased headcount in support of our operations 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of million in fiscal year as compared to was due principally to increased pre commercial and business development activities in support of our pnh clinical trials as well as continued growth of our operations 
we believe general and administrative costs will increase in fiscal as we continue to put in place the structure needed to commercialize pexelizumab and eculizumab 
total operating expenses were million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 

table of contents investment income was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year and million for fiscal the increase in investment income of million in resulted primarily from higher interest rates and higher principal amounts 
interest expense was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year and million for fiscal the decrease in interest expense is attributable to the lower interest rate for the notes in fiscal year we recorded a million loss from early extinguishment of the notes  which consisted of the write off of the remaining balance of non refundable deferred financing costs of approximately million and the redemption premium of approximately million 
during the first fiscal quarter of we recorded a net gain to other income of million to complete the termination of the unigraft xenotransplantation program at columbus farming corporation  or cfc 
this consisted of the extinguishment of the million note payable used to purchase the xenotransplantation assets and the extinguishment of the accrued interest of million on the note  partially offset by the transfer to tyco international  ltd  or tyco  of the remaining assets of  used to secure the note 
see section entitled business other preclinical programs unigraft xenotransplantation technologies program 
a state tax benefit of million  million and million was recognized in each of fiscal year  and  respectively  resulting from our estimated exchange of our fiscal and actual exchange of our fiscal  and incremental research and development tax credits 
as a result of the above factors  we incurred net losses of million  million  and million or   and basic and diluted net loss per share for fiscal years ended july    and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception in january  we have financed our operations and capital expenditures principally through private placements of our common and preferred stock  an initial public offering of our common stock and subsequent follow on offerings  the sale of convertible notes  other debt financing  payments received under corporate collaborations and grants  and equipment and leasehold improvements financing 
as of july   our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities totaled million compared to million as of july  at july   our cash and cash equivalents consisted of million that we hold in short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months 
the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as compared to july  was due primarily to the redemption of our million notes and the funding of operating activities  partially offset by the sale of our notes for approximately million net of financing fees 
the net proceeds from the sale of the notes  less the redemption of the notes including the redemption premium  were million 
during the year ended july   we invested million in property  plant and equipment to support our research and development efforts 
we anticipate our research and development expense to increase generally for the foreseeable future to support our clinical and manufacturing development of our product candidates 
in august  we sold  shares of common stock in a public offering at per share  resulting in gross proceeds from the sale of million 
we incurred underwriting discounts and commissions of million or per share as well as other expenses  resulting in estimated net proceeds of million 

table of contents we anticipate that our existing capital resources as of july   together with the net proceeds from the august public offering  as well as the addition of our interest and investment income earned on available cash and marketable securities should provide us adequate resources to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements as currently expected for at least the next months 
we may pursue additional stock offerings  debt or other sources of funds to finance our operations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at july  and the effect such obligations and commercial commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future fiscal years 
these do not include milestones and assume non termination of agreements 
these obligations  commitments and supporting arrangements represent payments based on current operating forecasts  which are subject to change amounts in millions payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations convertible senior notes interest expense operating and capital leases total contractual obligations commercial commitments clinical and manufacturing development licenses research and development total commercial commitments contractual obligations our contractual obligations include our million convertible senior notes due february  or notes  our annual payments of approximately million for operating and capital leases  principally for facilities and equipment  and an open letter of credit of  which serves as a security deposit on our facility in cheshire  connecticut 
convertible senior notes in january we sold million principal amount of notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended 
the interest rate on the notes is per annum on the principal amount from january   payable semi annually in arrears in cash on february and august of each year  beginning august  the notes is convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share 
we do not have the right to redeem any of the notes prior to maturity 

table of contents we do not have financial covenants related to our notes 
however  there are certain designated events which could occur such as a liquidation  tender offer  consolidation  merger  recapitalization  or otherwise  in connection with which or more of our common stock is exchanged for  converted into  acquired for or constitutes solely the right to receive  consideration which is not at least common stock that is listed on a us national exchange or market 
if the holder elects to convert its notes upon the occurrence of a designated event  the holder will be entitled to receive an additional number of shares of common stock on the conversion date 
these additional shares are intended to compensate the holders for the loss of the time value of the conversion option  are set according to a table within the offering document  and are capped in no event will the shares issuable upon conversion of a note exceed per  principal amount 
we incurred deferred financing costs related to this offering of the notes of approximately million  which are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet and are being amortized as a component of interest expense over the seven year term of the notes 
capital leases we currently lease office equipment under capital lease agreements expiring in the assets and liabilities under capital lease are recorded at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the asset 
the assets are amortized over the lower of their related lease terms or their estimated useful lives 
the interest rate on the above capital lease is and is imputed based on the lower of our incremental borrowing rate at the inception of each lease 
amortization and interest expense for the years ended july  and was  and  respectively 
operating leases our operating leases are principally for facilities and equipment 
we lease our headquarters and research and development facility in cheshire  connecticut 
the lease has an initial term expiring in december at this site  we lease a total of  square feet of space 
we pay a pro rata percentage of real estate taxes and operating expenses 
our pilot manufacturing plant  which may be used for producing compounds for some of our current and anticipated clinical trials  is expected to remain in new haven  connecticut and encompasses approximately  square feet of labs and offices 
the lease in new haven has an initial term ending in october with three options to extend for one year each 
alexion antibody technologies  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  leases approximately  square feet of labs  office space and unimproved storage in san diego  california 
the lease expires in august we believe our research and development facilities and pilot manufacturing facility  together with third party manufacturing facilities  will be adequate for our current ongoing activities 
commercial commitments our commercial commitments consist of cancelable research and development  licenses  operations  clinical development including clinical trials  and manufacturing cost commitments along with anticipated supporting arrangements  subject to certain limitations and cancellation clauses 
the timing and level of our commercial scale manufacturing costs assuming we utilize our long term commercial scale product manufacturing capacity  which may or may not be realized  are contingent upon our clinical development programs progress as well as our commercialization plans 
our commercial commitments are represented principally by our agreement with lonza biologics  plc and our collaboration with p g pharmaceuticals 

table of contents lonza agreement the large scale product supply agreement dated december   or the lonza agreement  between lonza biologics plc  or lonza  and us  relating to the manufacture of our product candidate eculizumab  was amended  or the lonza amendment  in april under the lonza amendment  the facility in which lonza will manufacture eculizumab is changed  the manufacturing capacity we are required to purchase is reduced  and future potential payments of million by us to lonza relating to achievement of eculizumab sales milestones and of up to million payable by us relating to manufacturing yields achieved by lonza are eliminated 
in august we paid lonza an additional million as a non refundable advance under the lonza amendment 
in addition  the amounts we would be required to pay in connection with a voluntary termination of the lonza agreement by us have been changed 
under the lonza agreement  as amended by the lonza amendment  if we terminate the lonza agreement on or prior to september   we may be required to pay different amounts  depending on when the lonza agreement is terminated  which are between zero and approximately million and  if we terminate the lonza agreement after september   we may be required to pay for batches of product scheduled for manufacture up to months following termination 
p g pharmaceuticals collaboration in december  we and p g entered into a binding memorandum of understanding  or mou  pursuant to which the january collaboration was revised 
under the revised structure per the mou  we and p g share decision making and responsibility for all future us development and commercialization costs for pexelizumab  including clinical  manufacturing  marketing  and sales efforts 
the revised collaboration per the mou provides that we and p g each incur approximately of all phase iii clinical trial  product development and manufacturing  and commercialization costs necessary for the potential approval and marketing of pexelizumab in the us and that we will receive approximately of the gross margin on us sales  if any 
p g agreed to retain responsibility for future development and commercialization costs outside the us  with us receiving a royalty on sales outside the us  if any 
we are responsible for royalties on certain third party intellectual property worldwide  if such intellectual property is necessary 
additionally  as part of the mou  we will receive milestone payments for achieving specified development steps  regulatory filings and approvals 
we and p g have agreed  as per the mou  that we will share concurrently of the ongoing us pre production and development manufacturing costs for pexelizumab as well as any ami or cabg phase iii clinical trial costs 
p g has the right to terminate the collaboration or sublicense its rights at any time 
if p g terminates the collaboration  as per the mou  p g is required to contribute its share of agreed to obligations and costs incurred prior to the termination  but may not be required to contribute towards obligations incurred after termination 
in such circumstance all rights and the exclusive license to our intellectual property related to pexelizumab would revert back to us and we would be entitled to all future pexelizumab revenues  if any  without any sharing of revenues  if any  with p g 
if p g were to sublicense its rights  the sub licensee would be required to assume all of p g s obligations under the collaboration 
we rely on p g for the development  manufacture and potential commercialization of pexelizumab 
termination of our agreement by p g or sublicense of its collaboration rights could cause significant delays in the development  manufacture and potential commercialization of pexelizumab and result in significant additional costs to us 
under terms of our mou we may be obligated to reimburse p g for of cancellation costs under p g s third party pexelizumab manufacturing contract 
our portion of those cancellation costs could amount to as much as million 

table of contents additional payments additional payments  aggregating up to million  would be required if we elect to continue development under our current pre clinical development programs and if specified development milestones are reached including achievement of commercialization 
approximately million of these costs may be incurred in the next three years 
taxes for tax reporting purposes  as of july   we have available for federal tax reporting purposes  net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million which expire through of which approximately million resulted from the exercise of nonqualified stock options 
we also have federal and state research and development credit carry forwards of approximately million which begin to expire commencing in fiscal the tax reform act of contains certain provisions that limit our ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards in any given year resulting from cumulative changes in ownership interests in excess of percent over a three year period 
we have determined that these limitation provisions were triggered in for the years ended july and  the limitation is approximately million annually 
there is no future limitation as a result of this change in ownership 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  or sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first annual period after june  pursuant to revisions to sfas no 
r in april by the fasb  we are obligated to start expensing options at the commencement of our fiscal year on august  in addition  in march  the fasb issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab which is to provide guidance regarding the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations and provide additional guidance regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
we expect to implement sfas r using the modified prospective application method 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections  which replaces apb opinion  accounting changes and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements and changes the requirements of the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
when a pronouncement includes specific transition provisions  those provisions should be followed 
this statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors before you decide to invest in our company and our business because these risk factors may have a significant impact on our business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
the risk and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents if we continue to incur operating losses  we may be unable to continue our operations 
we have incurred losses since we started our company in january as of july   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
if we continue to incur operating losses and fail to become a profitable company  we may be unable to continue our operations 
since we began our business  we have focused on research and development of product candidates 
we have no products that are available for sale and do not know when we will have products available for sale  if ever 
we expect to continue to operate at a net loss for at least the next several years as we continue our research and development efforts  continue to conduct clinical trials and develop manufacturing  sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
our future profitability depends on our receiving regulatory approval of our product candidates and our ability to successfully manufacture and market approved drugs 
the extent and the timing of our future losses and our profitability  if we are ever profitable  are highly uncertain 
we are subject to extensive government regulation  if we do not obtain regulatory approval for our drug products  we will not be able to sell our drug products 
we and our partners cannot sell or market our drugs without regulatory approval 
if we or our partners do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our products  the value of our company and our results of operations will be harmed 
in the united states  we or our partners must obtain and maintain approval from the fda for each indication for each drug that we intend to sell 
obtaining fda approval is typically a lengthy and expensive process  and approval is highly uncertain 
foreign governments also regulate drugs distributed outside the united states  whose approval can also be lengthy  expensive and highly uncertain 
none of our product candidates has received regulatory approval to be marketed and sold in the united states or any other country 
we may not receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates for at least the next several years  if ever 
we and our partners  contract manufacturers and suppliers are subject to rigorous and extensive regulation by the fda  other federal and state agencies  and governmental authorities in other countries 
these regulations apply both before and after approval of our product candidates  if our product candidates are ever approved  and cover  among other things  testing  manufacturing  quality control  labeling  advertising  promotion  and export of biologics 
failure to comply with the laws  including statutes and regulations  administered by the fda or other agencies could result in administrative and judicial sanctions  including  warning letters  fines and other civil penalties  delay in approving or refusal to approve a product candidate  product recall or seizure  interruption of production  operating restrictions  injunctions  and criminal prosecution 
the fda has granted fast track status for pexelizumab for use during cpb and for treatment of ami  and for eculizumab in treatment of membranous nephritis 
although fast track status may expedite development and fda review of an application  there can be no assurance that pexelizumab or eculizumab will be reviewed more expeditiously for their fast track indications than would otherwise have been the case or will be approved promptly  or at all 
further  the fda could revoke fast track status for pexelizumab or eculizumab 
the fda has granted orphan drug designation for eculizumab in the treatment of pnh and membranous nephritis 
orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in  or shorten the duration of  the fda review and approval process 
if a product which has an orphan drug designation is the first drug of its type to receive fda approval for the indication for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity  ie  the fda may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years  except in limited circumstances 

table of contents we depend heavily on the success of our lead product candidates  eculizumab and pexelizumab  which are still under development 
if we do not obtain fda approval of our lead product candidates  or if fda delays approval or narrows the indications for which we may market these product candidates  our business will be materially harmed 
we anticipate that in the near term our ability to generate revenues will depend on the successful development and commercialization of eculizumab and pexelizumab 
the commercial success of our lead product candidates will depend on several factors  including the following successful completion of our ongoing phase iii clinical trials for these product candidates  receipt of marketing approvals from the fda and similar foreign regulatory authorities  establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities ourselves or through third party manufacturers  successfully launching commercial sales of the products  and acceptance of the products in the medical community and by third party payers 
if the data from our ongoing phase iii pivotal clinical trials for our lead product candidates are not satisfactory  we may not proceed with the filing of a biological license application  or bla  for one or both of our lead product candidates or we may be forced to delay the filing 
even if the results of the ongoing pivotal trials appear satisfactory and we file a bla  the fda and similar foreign regulatory agencies may not accept our filing  may request additional information from us  including data from additional clinical trials  and  ultimately  may not grant marketing approval 
even if the fda and similar foreign regulatory authorities do grant marketing approval for one or both of our product candidates  they may narrow the indications for which we are permitted to market one or both products  or may pose other restrictions on the use or marketing of the product 
a narrowed indication or other restrictions may limit the market potential for the affected product 
if we are not successful in commercializing one or both of our lead product candidates  or are significantly delayed or limited in doing so  our business will be materially harmed and we may need to curtail or cease operations 
if our drug trials are delayed or achieve unfavorable results  we will have to delay or may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for our products 
we must conduct extensive testing of our product candidates before we can obtain regulatory approval for our products 
we need to conduct both preclinical animal testing and clinical human trials 
these tests and trials may not achieve favorable results 
the fda typically requires two well controlled clinical trials that demonstrate efficacy in order to obtain fda approval to market a product candidate 
the spa for each of our ongoing phase iii clinical programs for eculizumab and pexelizumab provides for only a single efficacy trial and the fda has indicated that the trials should provide compelling evidence of clinically meaningful benefit in order to warrant consideration for marketing approval of the product candidate 
the fda has noted that a study that is merely statistically positive may not provide the evidence necessary to support filing or approval of a product candidate 
in addition  the fda has noted that it may require additional safety information before granting marketing approval 
we would need to reevaluate any drug that did not test favorably and either alter the study  the drug or the dose and perform additional or repeat tests  or abandon the drug development project 
in those circumstances  we would not be able to obtain regulatory approval on a timely basis  if ever 
even if approval is granted  the approval may require limitations on the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed 

table of contents clinical trials completed to date have not achieved their primary endpoints 
in september  we announced the completion of enrollment in a phase iib trial of pexelizumab for the treatment of complications in patients after cabg with cpb including the reduction of the frequency and severity of myocardial infarctions and frequency of death 
the primary therapeutic pre set goal of the trial  referred to as the primary endpoint  was not achieved 
however  in the pre specified population that included approximately of the patient population  ie the patients who had cabg surgery without valve surgery  those that received pexelizumab at the highest dose level experienced a statistically significant reduction in larger post surgical heart attacks 
based on these results  in january  we commenced enrollment of a phase iii clinical trial of pexelizumab in patients undergoing cabg with cpb 
we completed the target patient enrollment of approximately  patients in february in august  we disclosed preliminary results that indicated that the primary endpoint was not achieved with statistical significance 
the primary endpoint in this phase iii trial was a composite of the incidence of death or myocardial infarction  measured at days post procedure  in patients undergoing cabg without simultaneous valve surgery 
we have concluded two phase ii studies with pexelizumab in ami one study in patients receiving angioplasty  a procedure for opening up narrowed or blocked arteries that supply blood to the heart  and the other in patients receiving thrombolytic therapy  a procedure for dissolving clots that block heart vessels 
the angioplasty study  called comma  and the thrombolytic study  called comply  completed patient enrollment in april and january  respectively 
results from both studies were reported at the november annual meeting of the american heart association 
in both studies  the primary endpoint of a reduction of myocardial infarction was not reached  however in the comma study  pexelizumab treatment was associated with a statistically significant  dose dependent reduction in death 
in  we announced the completion of a phase iia trial of eculizumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  or ra 
the primary endpoint for this trial was met by the group of patients who received the mid level  monthly dosing regimen of eculizumab  but patients who received higher or lower doses of eculizumab in the clinical trial did not achieve the primary endpoint 
the primary endpoint in this phase iia trial was acr at months 
in january  we announced preliminary results of a phase iib study of eculizumab in approximately ra patients 
results of the trial indicate that the primary endpoint was achieved with statistical significance in one of the dosing regimens the monthly dosing arm  but not in the higher  bimonthly dosing arm 
completion of these and other trials does not guarantee that we will initiate additional trials for our product candidates  that if the trials are initiated what the scope and phase of the trial will be or that they will be completed  or that if the trials are completed  that the results will provide a sufficient basis to proceed with further trials or to apply for or receive regulatory approvals or to commercialize products 
results of trials could be inconclusive  requiring additional or repeat trials 
if the results achieved in our clinical trials are insufficient to proceed to further trials or to regulatory approval of our product candidates our company could be materially adversely affected 
failure of a trial to achieve its pre specified primary endpoint generally increases the likelihood that additional studies will be required if we determine to continue development of the product candidate  and reduces the likelihood of timely development of and regulatory approval to market the product candidate 

table of contents there are many reasons why drug testing could be delayed or terminated 
for human trials  patients must be recruited and each product candidate must be tested at various doses and formulations for each clinical indication 
also  to ensure safety and effectiveness  the effect of drugs often must be studied over a long period of time  especially for the chronic diseases that we are studying 
unfavorable results or insufficient patient enrollment in our clinical trials could delay or cause us to abandon a product development program 
additional factors that can cause delay  impairment or termination of our clinical trials include slow patient enrollment  long treatment time required to demonstrate effectiveness  lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate  disruption of operations at the clinical trial sites  adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients  the failure of patients taking the placebo to continue to participate in our clinical trials  lack of effectiveness of the product candidate being tested  and lack of sufficient funds 
we may expand our business through new acquisitions that could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition 
our business strategy includes expanding our products and capabilities  and we may seek acquisitions to do so 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including substantial cash expenditures  potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  some of which may be difficult or impossible to identify at the time of acquisition  difficulties in assimilating the operations of the acquired companies  diverting our management s attention away from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience  and the potential loss of our key employees or key employees of the acquired companies 
we cannot assure you that any acquisition will result in short term or long term benefits to us 
we may incorrectly judge the value or worth of an acquired company or business 
in addition  our future success would depend in part on our ability to manage the rapid growth associated with some of these acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to make the combination of our business with that of acquired businesses or companies work or be successful 
furthermore  the development or 
table of contents expansion of our business or any acquired business or companies may require a substantial capital investment by us 
we may not have these necessary funds or they might not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
we may also seek to raise funds by selling shares of our capital stock  which could dilute current stockholders ownership interest in our company  or securities convertible into our capital stock  which could dilute current stockholders ownership interest in our company upon conversion 
if we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations  we will be unable to continue or complete our product development 
we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our operations and product development for at least twenty four months 
we will need to raise additional capital before or after that time to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
we are currently conducting or initiating several clinical trials 
funding needs may shift between programs and potentially accelerate and increase if we initiate new pivotal trials for our product candidates  including any pivotal clinical trial of pexelizumab for ami patients undergoing angioplasty 
we rely heavily on p g to fund development of pexelizumab 
if p g were to terminate the pexelizumab collaboration  we could have to raise additional capital or find new collaboration partners in order to continue the development of pexelizumab 
additional financing could take the form of public or private debt or equity offerings  equity line facilities  bank loans  collaborative research and development arrangements with corporate partners and or the sale or licensing of some of our property 
the amount of capital we may need depends on many factors  including the existence  terms and status of collaborative arrangements and strategic partnerships  such as our collaboration with p g  the progress  timing and scope of our research and development programs  the progress  timing and scope of our preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals  the time and cost necessary to further develop manufacturing processes  arrange for contract manufacturing or build manufacturing facilities and obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for those facilities  the time and cost necessary to develop sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost necessary to sell  market and distribute our products  if any are approved  changes in applicable governmental regulatory policies  and any new collaborative  licensing and other commercial relationships that we may establish 
we may not get funding when we need it or funding may only be available on unfavorable terms 
if we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital requirements  we may have to delay  scale back or eliminate our research and development activities or future operations 
we might have to license our technology to others 
this could result in sharing revenues that we might otherwise retain for ourselves 
any of these actions would harm our business 

table of contents we are significantly leveraged 
on july   we had outstanding million principal amount of convertible senior notes 
these notes remain outstanding  and the degree to which we are leveraged could  among other things make it difficult for us to make payments on our notes  make it difficult for us to obtain financing for working capital acquisitions or other purposes on favorable terms  if at all  make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures  and limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in  our business 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
if our collaboration with p g is terminated or p g reduces its commitment to our collaboration  our ability to develop and commercialize pexelizumab in the time expected  or at all  and our business would be harmed 
we rely heavily on p g to perform development  obtain commercial manufacturing  and provide sales and marketing for pexelizumab 
while we cannot assure you that pexelizumab will ever be successfully developed and commercialized  if p g does not perform its obligations in a timely manner  or at all  our ability to commercialize pexelizumab will be significantly adversely affected 
we rely on p g to provide funding and additional resources for the development and commercialization of pexelizumab 
these include funds and resources for clinical development and clinical and commercial manufacturing  obtaining regulatory approvals  and sales  marketing and distribution efforts worldwide 
p g has the right to terminate the collaboration or sublicense its collaboration rights at any time 
termination of our agreement with p g would cause significant delays in the development of pexelizumab and result in significant additional development costs to us 
if we were to continue development of pexelizumab following termination by p g  we would need to fund the development and commercialization of pexelizumab on our own or identify a new development partner 
we would need to develop or acquire replacement expertise in many areas necessary for the development and potential commercialization of pexelizumab  or enter into agreements with other companies with respect to those matters 
we do not have the resources to replace some of the functions provided or funded by p g 
accordingly  we might have to stop the development of pexelizumab or shift resources from other product development programs until alternative resources were obtained 
sublicense by p g also could cause significant delays in the development of pexelizumab and result in substantial additional development costs to us 
we might also have to repeat testing already completed with p g 
in addition  sublicense would introduce a new collaboration partner which could create new and additional risks to the development of pexelizumab that cannot be identified at this time 

table of contents we cannot guarantee that p g will devote the resources necessary to successfully develop and commercialize pexelizumab in a timely manner  if at all 
furthermore  p g may devote the necessary resources  but we may still not successfully develop and commercialize pexelizumab 
if we are unable to engage and retain third party collaborators  our research and development efforts may be delayed 
we depend upon third party collaborators to assist us in the development of our product candidates 
if any of our existing collaborators breaches or terminates its agreement with us or does not perform its development work under an agreement in a timely manner  or at all  we would experience significant delays in the development or commercialization of our product candidates 
we would also experience significant delays if we could not engage additional collaborators when required 
in either event  we would be required to devote additional funds or other resources to these activities or to terminate them 
this would divert funds or other resources from other parts of our business 
we cannot assure you that current collaboration arrangements will be continued in their current form  we will be able to negotiate acceptable collaborative agreements to develop or commercialize our product candidates  any arrangements with third parties will be successful  or current or potential collaborators will not pursue treatments for other diseases or seek other ways of developing treatments for our disease targets 
if the trading price of our common stock continues to fluctuate in a wide range  our stockholders will suffer considerable uncertainty with respect to an investment in our common stock 
the trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future 
factors such as announcements of fluctuations in our or our competitors operating results or clinical or scientific results  fluctuations in the trading prices or business prospects of our competitors and collaborators  including  but not limited to p g  changes in our prospects  and market conditions for biotechnology stocks in general could have a significant impact on the future trading prices of our common stock and our convertible senior notes 
in particular  the trading price of the common stock of many biotechnology companies  including ours  has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have at times been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies whose stocks were affected 
this is due to several factors  including general market conditions  the announcement of the results of our clinical trials or product development and the results of our attempts to obtain fda approval for our products 
in particular  since august   the sales price of our common stock has ranged from a low of per share to a high of per share 
while we cannot predict our future performance  if our stock price continues to fluctuate in a wide range  an investment in our common stock may result in considerable uncertainty for an investor 

table of contents if we cannot protect the confidentiality and proprietary nature of our trade secrets  our business and competitive position will be harmed 
our business requires using sensitive technology  techniques and proprietary compounds that we protect as trade secrets 
however  since we are a small company  we also rely heavily on collaboration with suppliers  outside scientists and other drug companies 
collaboration presents a strong risk of exposing our trade secrets 
if our trade secrets were exposed  it would help our competitors and adversely affect our business prospects 
in order to protect our drugs and technology more effectively  we need to obtain and maintain patents covering the drugs and technologies we develop 
we may obtain patents through ownership or license 
our drugs are expensive and time consuming to test and develop 
without patent protection  competitors may copy our methods  or the chemical structure or other aspects of our drugs 
even if we obtain and maintain patents  the patents may not be broad enough to protect our drugs from copycat products 
if we are found to be infringing on patents owned by others  we may be forced to pay damages to the patent owner and obtain a license to continue the manufacture  sale or development of our drugs and or pay damages 
if we cannot obtain a license  we may be prevented from the manufacture  sale or development of our drugs 
parts of our technology  techniques and proprietary compounds and potential drug candidates  including those which are in licensed  may be found to infringe patents owned by or granted to others 
if we cannot resolve these conflicts  we may be liable for damages  be required to obtain costly licenses or be stopped from manufacturing  using or selling our products or conducting other activities 
for example  we are aware of broad patents owned by others relating to the manufacture  use and sale of recombinant humanized antibodies  recombinant humanized single chain antibodies  recombinant human antibodies  and recombinant human single chain antibodies 
many of our product candidates  including our two leading product candidates  eculizumab and pexelizumab  are either genetically engineered antibodies  including recombinant humanized antibodies  recombinant humanized single chain antibodies  recombinant human antibodies  or recombinant human single chain antibodies 
we have received notices from the owners of some of these patents claiming that their patents may be infringed by the development  manufacture or sale of some of our drug candidates  including pexelizumab and eculizumab 
we are also aware of other patents owned by third parties that might be claimed to be infringed by the development and commercialization of some of our drug candidates  including pexelizumab and eculizumab 
in respect to some of these patents  we have obtained licenses  or expect to obtain licenses 
however  with regard to other patents  we have either determined in our judgment that our products do not infringe the patents  or we do not believe the patents are valid  or we have identified and are testing various modifications that we believe should not infringe the patents and which should permit commercialization of our product candidates 
any holder of these patents or other patents covering similar technology could sue us for damages and seek to prevent us from manufacturing  selling or developing our drugs 
legal disputes can be costly and time consuming to defend 
if any patent holder successfully challenges our judgment that our products do not infringe their patents or that their patents are invalid  we could be required to pay costly damages or to obtain a license to sell or develop our drugs 
a required license may be costly or may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a costly license  or inability to obtain a necessary license  could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents there can be no assurance that we would prevail in a patent infringement action  will be able to obtain a license to any third party patent on commercially reasonable terms  successfully develop non infringing alternatives on a timely basis  or license alternative non infringing technology  if any exists  on commercially reasonable terms 
any impediment to our ability to manufacture or sell approved forms of our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
if the testing or use of our products harms people  we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims 
the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of drugs for use in humans exposes us to product liability risks 
side effects and other problems from using our products could give rise to product liability claims against us 
we might have to recall our products  if any  from the marketplace 
some of these risks are unknown at this time 
in addition  we may be sued by people who participate in our trials 
a number of patients who participate in such trials are already very ill when they enter the trial 
any informed consents or waivers obtained from people who sign up for our trials may not protect us from liability or litigation 
our product liability insurance may not cover all potential liabilities or may not completely cover any covered liabilities 
moreover  we may not be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms 
in addition  negative publicity relating to a product liability claim may make it more difficult  or impossible  for us to recruit patients for our clinical trials or to market and sell our products 
as a result of these factors  a product liability claim  even if successfully defended  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
use of c inhibitors  such as pexelizumab and eculizumab  is associated with an increased risk for infection with neisseria bacteria 
one patient in our trials of eculizumab for the treatment of membranous nephritis became infected with neisseria bacteria 
serious cases of neisseria infection can result in brain damage  loss of limbs or parts of limbs  kidney failure  or death 
we are subject to environmental laws and potential exposure to environmental liabilities 
we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations  including the handling and disposal of non hazardous and hazardous wastes  including medical and biological wastes  and emissions and discharges into the environment  including air  soils and water sources 
failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action  penalties or the imposition of other liabilities 
we also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment 
under certain of these laws and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating its property or locations to which wastes were sent from its facilities  without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or necessarily caused  the contamination 
such obligations and liabilities  which to date have not been material  could have a material impact on our business and financial condition 

table of contents if we cannot manufacture our drug candidates in sufficient amounts at acceptable costs and on a timely basis  we may be unable to have the necessary materials for product testing  and later for potential sale in the market 
either event would harm our business 
for our drug trials  we need to produce sufficient amounts of product for testing 
our small manufacturing plant cannot manufacture enough of our product candidates for later stage clinical development or commercial supply 
in addition  we do not have the capacity to produce more than one product candidate at a time 
we depend on a few outside suppliers for manufacturing 
if we experience interruptions in the manufacture of our products  our drug development and commercialization efforts will be delayed 
if any of our outside manufacturers stops manufacturing our products or reduces the amount manufactured  or is otherwise unable to manufacture our required amounts at our required quality  we will need to find other alternatives 
if we are unable to find an acceptable outside manufacturer on reasonable terms  we will have to divert our own resources to manufacturing  which may not be sufficient to produce the necessary quantity or quality of product 
as a result  our ability to conduct testing and drug trials and our plans for commercialization would be materially adversely affected 
submission of products and new development programs for regulatory approval  as well as our plans for commercialization  would be delayed 
our competitive position and our prospects for achieving profitability would be materially and adversely affected 
manufacture of drug products  including the need to develop and utilize manufacturing processes that consistently produce our drug products to their required quality specifications  is highly regulated by the fda and other domestic and foreign authorities 
we cannot assure you that we or our third party collaborators will successfully comply with all of those regulations  which failure would have a materially adverse effect on our business 
manufacture of our drug products is highly technical and only a few third parties have the ability and capacity to manufacture our drug products for our development and commercialization needs 
we can not assure you that these potential third party collaborators will agree to manufacture our products on our behalf on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if we do achieve agreement from one or more third parties to manufacture our drug products  we can not assure you that they will be able or willing to honor the terms of the agreements  including any obligations to manufacture the drug products in accordance with regulatory requirements and to our quality specifications and volume requirements 
due to the highly technical requirements of manufacturing our drug products  our third party collaborators and we may be unable to manufacture our drug products despite their and our efforts 
inability to contract with third party manufacturers on commercially reasonable terms  or failure or delay by our third party manufacturers  if any  in manufacturing our drug products in the volumes and quality required  would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have no experience or capacity for manufacturing drug products in volumes that would be necessary to support commercial sales 
if we are unable to establish and maintain commercial scale manufacturing within our planned time and cost parameters  sales of our products and our financial performance would be adversely affected 
currently  we are relying on p g to retain appropriate commercial scale manufacturing for pexelizumab through one or more third party manufacturers 
p g has contracted with chiron corporation for the commercial scale manufacture of pexelizumab 
the failure of p g to obtain and maintain appropriate commercial scale manufacturing for pexelizumab in accordance with all regulatory requirements on a timely basis  or at all  may prevent or impede the commercialization of pexelizumab 
we have executed a commercial scale product supply agreement with lonza biologics  plc for the long term manufacture of eculizumab 
the failure of lonza to manufacture appropriate supplies of eculizumab on a timely basis  or at all  may prevent or impede the commercialization of eculizumab 
due to the nature of the current market for third party commercial manufacturing arrangements  many arrangements require substantial penalty payments by the customer for failure to use the manufacturing capacity contracted for 
we could 
table of contents owe substantial penalty payments to lonza if we were not to use the manufacturing capacity we contracted for  and we could be required to share on an equal basis with p g substantial penalty payments owed by p g for its failure to utilize the manufacturing capacity it contracted for with third party manufacturers for the supply of pexelizumab 
the payment of a substantial penalty would harm our financial condition 
if we are unable to establish sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  or to enter into agreements with third parties to do so  we will be unable to successfully market and sell future drug products 
we have no sales or distribution personnel or capabilities 
we have only recently established core pre commercial marketing capabilities 
if we are unable to continue developing those capabilities  either by developing our own capabilities or entering into agreements with others  we will not be able to successfully sell our future drug products 
in that event  we will not be able to generate significant revenues 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to hire the qualified sales and marketing personnel we need 
we may not be able to enter into any marketing or distribution agreements with third party providers on acceptable terms  if at all 
currently  we are relying on p g for sales  marketing and distribution of pexelizumab 
p g  or any future third party collaborators  may not succeed at selling  marketing or distributing any of our future drug products 
if we are unable to obtain reimbursement for our future products from government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations  our products may be too costly for regular use and our ability to generate revenues would be harmed 
our products  if commercialized  may be significantly more expensive than traditional drug treatments 
our future revenues and profitability will be adversely affected if we cannot depend on governmental and private third party payers to defray the cost of our products to the consumer 
if these entities refuse to provide reimbursement with respect to our products or determine to provide an insufficient level of reimbursement  our products may be too costly for general use 
our profitability may be adversely impacted if we choose to offer our products at a reduced price 
any limitation on the use of our products or any decrease in the price of our products without a corresponding decrease in expenses will have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve profitability 
in some foreign countries  the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed 
the requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country 
for example  the european union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use 
a member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market 
our results of operation may suffer if we are unable to market our products in foreign countries or if the reimbursement for our products in foreign countries is limited 
since our products will likely be too expensive for most patients to afford without health insurance coverage  adequate coverage and reimbursement by third party payors is essential to our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates 
in particular  given a number of factors  including the limited pnh population  costs of manufacturing and commercialization  clinical costs and other historic and future costs  it is likely that the price of eculizumab  once established  will be prohibitively expensive without patient access to adequate health insurance coverage and reimbursement by third party payors 
if patients do not have access to adequate coverage or if third party payors do not provide reimbursement at a sufficient level it would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operation 

table of contents if our competitors get to the marketplace before we do with better or cheaper drugs  our drugs may not be profitable to sell or to continue to develop 
each of abbott laboratories inc  adprotech ltd  avant immunotherapeutics  inc  baxter international  inc  millennium pharmaceuticals  inc  neurogen corporation  tanox  inc  and xoma  ltd 
have publicly announced their intentions to develop drugs which target the inflammatory effects of complement in the immune system 
we are also aware that glaxosmithkline  plc  merck co  inc  and pfizer  inc 
are also attempting to develop complement inhibitor therapies 
each of cambridge antibody technology group  plc  morphosys ag and dyax corporation has publicly announced intentions to develop therapeutic human antibodies from libraries of human antibody genes 
additionally  each of abgenix  inc and medarex  inc 
has publicly announced intentions to develop therapeutic human antibodies from mice that have been bred to include some human antibody genes 
these and other pharmaceutical companies  many of which have significantly greater resources than we  may develop  manufacture and market better or cheaper drugs than our product candidates 
they may establish themselves in the marketplace before we are able even to finish our clinical trials 
other pharmaceutical companies also compete with us to attract academic research institutions as drug development partners  including for licensing these institutions proprietary technology 
if our competitors successfully enter into such arrangements with academic institutions  we will be precluded from pursuing those unique opportunities and may not be able to find equivalent opportunities elsewhere 
if we fail to recruit and retain personnel  our research and product development programs may be delayed 
we are highly dependent upon the efforts of our senior management and scientific personnel  particularly dr 
leonard bell  md  our chief executive officer and a member of our board of directors  david w 
keiser  our president  chief operating officer and a member of our board of directors  and stephen p 
squinto  phd  our executive vice president and head of research 
there is intense competition in the biotechnology industry for qualified scientific and technical personnel 
since our business is very science oriented and specialized  we need to continue to attract and retain such people 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for developing our business 
we have a key man life insurance policy for dr 
bell and employment agreements with dr 
bell  mr 
keiser and dr 
squinto 
none of our key personnel is nearing retirement age or to our knowledge  planning to retire 
to our knowledge  there is no tension between any of our key personnel and the board of directors 
if we lose the services of our management and scientific personnel and fail to recruit other scientific and technical personnel  our research and product development programs will be materially and adversely affected 
in particular  we highly value the services of dr 
bell  our chief executive officer 
the loss of his services could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our development objectives 
our ability to use net operating loss carry forwards to reduce future tax payments may be limited if there is a change in ownership of alexion 
as of july   we had approximately million of net operating loss carry forwards  or nols  available to reduce taxable income in future years 
we believe that some of these nols are currently subject to an annual limitation under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
our ability to utilize our nols may be further limited if we undergo an ownership change  as defined in section  as a result of subsequent changes in the ownership of our outstanding stock 
we would undergo an ownership change if  among other things  the stockholders  or group of stockholders  who own or have owned  directly or indirectly  or more of the value of our stock  or are otherwise treated as stockholders under section and the regulations promulgated there under  increase their 
table of contents aggregate percentage ownership of our stock by more than percentage points over the lowest percentage of our stock owned by these stockholders at any time during the testing period  which is generally the three year period preceding the potential ownership change 
in the event of an ownership change  section imposes an annual limitation on the amount of post ownership change taxable income a corporation may offset with pre ownership change nols 
the limitation imposed by section for any post change year would be determined by multiplying the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change subject to certain adjustments by the applicable long term tax exempt rate 
any unused limitation may be carried over to later years  and the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by built in gains which may be present with respect to assets held by us at the time of the ownership change that are recognized in the five year period after the ownership change 
our use of nols arising after the date of an ownership change would not be affected 
based upon our review of the aggregate change in percentage ownership during the current testing period  we do not believe that we experienced a change in ownership within the meaning of section as a result of the offering of our common stock in august however  such a determination is complex and there can be no assurance that the internal revenue service could not successfully challenge our conclusion 
even if the offering of our common stock did not cause an ownership change to occur immediately  the issuance  directly or indirectly  of a relatively large number of shares in that offering may mean that we may not be able to engage in transactions involving the issuance or deemed issuance of stock within the subsequent three year period without triggering an ownership change within the meaning of section in addition  there are circumstances beyond our control  such as market purchases of our stock by investors who are existing shareholders  or become shareholders as a result of such purchases  which could result in an ownership change with respect to our stock 
thus  there can be no assurance that our future actions  or future actions by our stockholders  will not result in the occurrence of an ownership change  which may limit our use of the nols and negatively affect future cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currently  we maintain approximately of our cash and investments in financial instruments with original maturity dates of three months or less  in financial instruments with original maturity dates of greater than three months and less than one year  and the remaining in financial instruments with original maturity dates of equal to or greater than one year and less than two years 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
we estimate that a change of basis points in interest rates with a weighted average duration of approximately months at july  would result in a  decrease or increase in the fair value of our cash and investments 
our outstanding long term liabilities as of july  consisted of million of our convertible senior notes due february  as the notes bear interest at a fixed rate  our results of operations would not be affected by interest rate changes 
although future borrowings may bear interest at a floating rate  and would therefore be affected by interest rate changes  we cannot reasonably estimate the effect and therefore do not believe that a change of basis points in interest rates would have a material effect on our financial condition 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item 

table of contents as of july   the market value of our million convertible senior notes due february   based on quoted market prices  was estimated at million
