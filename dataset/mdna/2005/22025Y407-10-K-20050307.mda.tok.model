table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those described under risk factors and included in other portions of this report 
overview the company as of december   we owned correctional  detention and juvenile facilities  three of which we lease to other operators 
we currently operate facilities  with a total design capacity of approximately  beds in states and the district of columbia 
we are the nation s largest owner and operator of privatized correctional and detention facilities and one of the largest prison operators in the united states behind only the federal government and three states 
our size and experience provide us with significant credibility with our current and prospective customers  and enables us to generate economies of scale in purchasing power for food services  health care and other supplies and services we offer to our customers 
we are compensated for operating and managing prisons and correctional facilities at an inmate per diem rate based upon actual or minimum guaranteed occupancy levels 
the significant expansion of the prison population in the united states has led to overcrowding in the state and federal prison systems  providing us with opportunities for growth 
however  recent economic developments have caused federal  state  and local governments to experience unusual budgetary constraints  putting pressure on governments to control correctional budgets  including per diem rates our customers pay to us 
nonetheless  while these constraints have and are expected to continue to put pressure on our operating margins  we believe the outsourcing of prison management services to private operators allows governments to manage increasing inmate populations while simultaneously controlling correctional costs and improving correctional services 
we believe our customers discover that partnering with private operators to provide residential services to their inmates introduces competition to their prison system  resulting in improvements to the quality and cost of corrections services throughout their correctional system 
further  the use of facilities owned and managed by private operators allows governments to expand prison capacity without incurring large capital commitments required to increase correctional capacity 
we also believe that having beds immediately available to our customers provides us with a distinct competitive advantage when bidding on new contracts 
while we have been successful in winning contract awards to provide management services for facilities we do not own  and will continue to pursue such management contracts  we believe the most significant opportunities for growth are in providing our government partners with available beds within facilities we currently own or develop 
we also believe that owning the facilities in which we provide management services enables us to more rapidly replace business lost compared with managed only facilities  since we can offer the same beds to new and existing customers and  with customer consent  may have more flexibility in moving our existing inmate populations to facilities with available capacity 
all of our management contracts generally provide our customers with the right to terminate our management contracts at any time without cause 
we currently have four correctional facilities  our northeast ohio correctional center  our north fork correctional facility  our crowley county correctional facility and our prairie correctional 
table of contents facility  which are substantially vacant and provide us with approximately  available beds 
on december   we were awarded a new contract from the bop to house approximately  federal inmates at the northeast ohio correctional center 
we expect to begin receiving inmates pursuant to this contract during the second quarter of we also have an additional facility located in stewart county  georgia  which is partially complete 
this facility  which is expected to be completed during the second quarter of  will bring approximately  additional beds on line 
in addition to these facilities  as of december   we also had a total of five facilities that had or more beds available at each facility  providing further potential for increased revenue and cash flow 
as a result of the completion of our recapitalization and refinancing transactions during the previous three years  we have significantly reduced our exposure to variable rate debt  lowered our after tax interest and dividend obligations associated with our outstanding debt and preferred stock  and now have no debt maturities on outstanding indebtedness until also as a result of the completion of these capital transactions  covenants under our senior secured credit facility were amended to provide greater flexibility for  among other matters  incurring unsecured indebtedness  capital expenditures  and permitted acquisitions  providing us with the financial flexibility to afford the capital investments to create additional beds without unduly straining our capital structure 
standard and poor s currently rates our senior secured debt as bb and our senior unsecured debt as b 
moody s investors service currently rates our senior secured debt as ba and our senior unsecured debt as b we are utilizing our financial flexibility and liquidity to strategically add bed capacity in a prudent manner 
during we completed the expansion of  beds at five of our facilities  which we expect to fill with existing customers 
in addition  during september  we announced our intention to complete construction of our  bed stewart county correctional facility located in stewart county  georgia  which is expected to be complete during the second quarter of during february  we announced the commencement of construction of the red rock correctional center  a new  bed correctional facility located in eloy  arizona  which is expected to be complete during the first quarter of we are also utilizing our financial flexibility and liquidity to continue making investments in technology 
while we have been successful in reducing our variable expenses primarily by taking advantage of our purchasing power  we believe the largest opportunity for further reducing our operating expenses depends on our ability to modernize our facility operations through investments in technology 
we believe investments in technology can enable us to operate safe and secure facilities with more efficient  highly skilled and better trained staff  and to reduce turnover 
approximately of our operating expenses consist of salaries and benefits 
containing these costs will continue to be challenging 
further  the turnover rate for correctional officers for our company  and for the corrections industry in general  remains high  and medical benefits for our employees continue to increase primarily due to continued rising healthcare costs throughout the country 
unlike the savings reaped in our variable operating expenses  reducing these staffing costs requires a long term strategy to control such costs through the deployment of newly developed technologies  many of which are unique and new to the corrections industry 
through the combination of our business development initiatives to increase our revenues by taking advantage of our available beds  and our strategies to generate savings and to contain our operating expenses  we believe we will be able to maintain our competitive advantage and continue to improve the quality services we provide to our customers at an economical price  thereby producing value to our stockholders 

table of contents critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is described in note to our audited financial statements 
the significant accounting policies and estimates which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following asset impairments 
as of december   we had billion in long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying values of our long lived assets  other than goodwill  when events suggest that an impairment may have occurred 
in these circumstances  we utilize estimates of undiscounted cash flows to determine if an impairment exists 
if an impairment exists  it is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
goodwill impairments 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  which established new accounting and reporting requirements for goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  all goodwill amortization ceased effective january  and goodwill attributable to each of our reporting units was tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
fair value was determined using a collaboration of various common valuation techniques  including market multiples  discounted cash flows  and replacement cost methods 
these impairment tests are required to be performed at adoption of sfas and at least annually thereafter 
we perform our impairment tests during the fourth quarter  in connection with our annual budgeting process  and whenever circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
based on our initial impairment tests  we recognized an impairment of million to write off the carrying value of goodwill associated with our locations included in the owned and managed reporting segment during the first quarter of this goodwill was established in connection with the acquisition of a company during the remaining goodwill  which is associated with the facilities we manage but do not own  was deemed to be not impaired 
this remaining goodwill was established in connection with the acquisitions of two service companies during  both of which were privately held service companies  that managed certain government owned adult and juvenile prison and jail facilities 
the implied fair value of goodwill of the locations included in the owned and managed reporting segment did not support the carrying value of any goodwill  primarily due to the highly leveraged capital structure 
no impairment of goodwill allocated to the locations included in the managed only reporting segment was deemed necessary  primarily because of the relatively minimal capital expenditure requirements  and therefore indebtedness  in connection with obtaining such management contracts 
under sfas  the impairment recognized at adoption of the new rules was reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in our statement of operations for the first quarter of impairment adjustments recognized after adoption  if any  are required to be recognized as operating expenses 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas generally requires us to record deferred income taxes for the tax effect of differences between book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 

table of contents deferred income taxes reflect the available net operating losses and the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
realization of the future tax benefits related to deferred tax assets is dependent on many factors  including our past earnings history  expected future earnings  the character and jurisdiction of such earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect utilization of our deferred tax assets  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
prior to the year ended december   we provided a valuation allowance to substantially reserve our deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas however  at december   we concluded that it was more likely than not that substantially all of our deferred tax assets would be realized 
as a result  in accordance with sfas  the valuation allowance applied to such deferred tax assets was reversed 
removal of the valuation allowance resulted in a significant non cash reduction in income tax expense 
in addition  because a portion of the previously recorded valuation allowance was established to reserve certain deferred tax assets upon the acquisitions of two service companies during  in accordance with sfas  removal of the valuation allowance resulted in a reduction to the remaining goodwill recorded in connection with such acquisitions to the extent the reversal related to the valuation allowance applied to deferred tax assets existing at the date the service companies were acquired 
in addition  removal of the valuation allowance resulted in an increase in our additional paid in capital related to the tax benefits of exercises of employee stock options and of grants of restricted stock 
the reduction to goodwill amounted to million  while additional paid in capital increased million 
during  the internal revenue service the irs completed its field audit of our federal income tax return 
during the fourth quarter of  the audit results underwent a review by the joint committee on taxation  a division of the irs 
based on that review  the irs adjusted the carryback claims we filed on our and federal income tax returns  requiring us to repay approximately million of refunds we received during and as a result of tax law changes provided by the job creation and worker assistance act of a portion of our tax loss was deemed not to be available for carryback to and due to our restructuring that occurred between and however  we will carry this tax loss forward to offset future taxable income 
while the adjustment did not result in a loss of deductions claimed  we were obligated to repay the amount of the adjusted refund  plus interest of approximately million  or million after taxes  through december  these obligations were accrued in our consolidated financial statements as of december   and were paid during the first quarter of the repayment of the refund adjusted by the irs resulted in an increase in the amount of deferred tax assets reflected on our balance sheet for the incremental net operating losses made available to offset taxable income in the future 
prior to this finding by the irs  we expected to generate sufficient taxable income during to utilize our remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards 
although the increase in our net operating loss carryforwards resulting from the repayment effectively extends the date in which our net operating loss carryforwards are fully utilized  we nonetheless still expect to generate sufficient taxable income during to utilize all of our remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards 
as a result  the irs finding and corresponding payment effectively accelerated to the first quarter of the cash taxes we expected to pay more evenly throughout  having no material impact on the total estimated cash flows for although we expect to utilize our remaining federal net operating losses in  we have approximately million in net operating losses applicable to various states that we expect to 
table of contents carry forward in future years to offset taxable income in such states 
these net operating losses begin expiring in accordingly  we have a valuation allowance of million for the estimated amount of the net operating losses that will expire unused  in addition to a million valuation allowance related to state tax credits that are also expected to expire unused 
although our estimate of future taxable income is based on current assumptions we believe to be reasonable  our assumptions may prove inaccurate and could change in the future  which could result in the expiration of additional net operating losses or credits 
we would be required to establish a valuation allowance at such time that we no longer expected to utilize these net operating losses or credits  which could result in a material impact on our results of operations in the future 
self funded insurance reserves 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in accrued liabilities for employee health  workers compensation  and automobile insurance claims 
we are significantly self insured for employee health  workers compensation  and automobile liability insurance claims 
as such  our insurance expense is largely dependent on claims experience and our ability to control our claims 
we have consistently accrued the estimated liability for employee health insurance claims based on our history of claims experience and the time lag between the incident date and the date the cost is paid by us 
we have accrued the estimated liability for workers compensation and automobile insurance claims based on a third party actuarial valuation of the outstanding liabilities 
these estimates could change in the future 
it is possible that future cash flows and results of operations could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions  new developments  or by the effectiveness of our strategies 
legal reserves 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in accrued liabilities related to certain legal proceedings in which we are involved 
we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims based on a range of potential outcomes 
in addition  we are subject to current and potential future legal proceedings for which little or no accrual has been reflected because our current assessment of the potential exposure is nominal 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with our general counsel s office and  as appropriate  outside counsel handling these matters  and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible that future cash flows and results of operations could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions  new developments  or by the effectiveness of our strategies 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the years ended december    and  the number of facilities we owned and managed  the number of facilities we managed but did not own  the number of facilities we leased to other operators  and the facilities we owned that were not yet in operation 

table of contents owned and managed managed only leased incomplete total facilities as of december  purchase of crowley county correctional facility expiration of the management contract for the okeechobee juvenile offender correctional center expiration of the management contract for the lawrenceville correctional facility facilities as of december  management contracts awarded by the texas department of criminal justice  net management contract awarded for the delta correctional facility expiration of the management contract for the tall trees facility expiration of the management contract for the southern nevada women s correctional center facilities as of december  year ended december  compared to the year ended december  during the year ended december   we generated net income available to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share  compared with net income available to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share  for the previous year 
contributing to the net income for compared to the previous year was an increase in operating income of million  from million during to million during as a result of an increase in occupancy levels and new management contracts  partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses 
net income available to common stockholders was negatively impacted during as compared to due to the recognition of an income tax provision in accordance with sfas during  amounting to million  or per diluted share  compared with an income tax benefit of million  or per diluted share during the income tax benefit during was primarily the result of our reversal of substantially all of the valuation allowance previously established for our deferred tax assets 
net income available to common stockholders during was favorably impacted by the refinancing and recapitalization transactions completed during the second and third quarters of these transactions included the issuance of million shares of common stock at a price of per share  along with the issuances of an aggregate million principal amount of senior notes 
the proceeds from these issuances were used to i purchase million shares of common stock issued upon the conversion of our million convertible subordinated notes with a stated rate of plus contingent interest accrued at and to pay accrued interest on the notes through the date of purchase at a price of per share  ii purchase million shares of our series b preferred stock that were tendered in a tender offer at a price of per share  including all accrued and unpaid dividends on such shares  iii redeem million shares of our series a preferred stock at a price of per share  plus accrued dividends to the redemption date  and iv pay down a portion of our senior bank credit facility 
in connection with the debt issuance during the third quarter of  we also obtained an amendment to our senior bank credit facility that  among other changes  lowered the interest rate applicable to the outstanding balance on the 
table of contents facility 
these refinancing and recapitalization transactions effectively reduced the average interest rates on a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness  and substantially reduced the after tax dividend obligations associated with our outstanding preferred stock 
partially offsetting the favorable impacts of the refinancing and recapitalization transactions  the company recorded a non cash gain of million during associated with the extinguishment of a promissory note issued in connection with certain stockholder litigation that was settled during the first quarter of in addition  financial results for included a charge of million for expenses associated with the refinancing and recapitalization transactions completed in the second and third quarters of during the first and second quarters of  the company completed the redemption of the remaining shares of both series a and series b preferred stock at the stated rates of per share and per share  respectively  plus accrued dividends to the redemption date  and obtained an additional amendment to the senior bank credit facility further lowering the interest rate spread applicable to the term loan portion of the facility 
our financial results were also favorably impacted by an increase in the amount of interest capitalized  from million during to million during  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 capitalization of interest associated with the construction and expansion projects during at six of our facilities 
we funded these construction and expansion projects with cash on hand and with cash generated from operating activities 
facility operations a key performance indicator we use to measure the revenue and expenses associated with the operation of the facilities we own or manage is expressed in terms of a compensated man day  and represents the revenue we generate and expenses we incur for one inmate for one calendar day 
revenue and expenses per compensated man day are computed by dividing facility revenue and expenses by the total number of compensated man days during the period 
a compensated man day represents a calendar day for which we are paid for the occupancy of an inmate 
we believe the measurement is useful because we are compensated for operating and managing facilities at an inmate per diem rate based upon actual or minimum guaranteed occupancy levels 
we also measure our ability to contain costs on a per compensated man day basis  which is largely dependent upon the number of inmates we accommodate 
further  per man day measurements are also used to estimate our potential profitability based on certain occupancy levels relative to design capacity 
revenue and expenses per compensated man day for all of the facilities we owned or managed  exclusive of those discontinued see further discussion below regarding discontinued operations  were as follows for the years ended december  and for the years ended december  revenue per compensated man day operating expenses per compensated man day fixed expense variable expense total operating margin per compensated man day operating margin average compensated occupancy 
table of contents business from our federal customers  including the bureau of prisons  or the bop  the united states marshals service  or the usms  and the united states bureau of immigration and customs enforcement  or ice  remains strong  while many of our state customers continue to experience budget difficulties 
our federal customers generated of our total revenue for both the years ended december  and while the budget difficulties experienced by our state customers present challenges with respect to our per diem rates resulting in pressure on our management revenue in future quarters  these governmental entities are also constrained with respect to funds available for prison construction 
we believe the lack of new bed supply combined with state budget difficulties has contributed to the increase in our occupancy and has led several states  some of which have never utilized the private sector  to outsource their correctional needs to us 
we currently expect these trends to continue 
additionally  as expected  we experienced a modest reduction in our operating margins during compared with as a result of recent contract awards for facilities we manage but do not own  which  as further described hereafter  provide per diem rates and operating margins at lower levels than our owned and managed business 
we entered into these contracts knowing our overall per diem rates and operating margins would decrease slightly  however  the opportunity to both expand our level of service with existing customers and provide services to new customers with very little capital requirements outweighed the effects of the operating margin reductions 
our operating margins were also negatively impacted by the expenses incurred in connection with the resumption of operations and the process of ramping up occupancy at three of our facilities  the northeast ohio correctional center located in youngstown  ohio during the second and third quarters of  the tallahatchie county correctional facility located in tutwiler  mississippi during the first and second quarters of  and the managed only delta correctional facility located in greenwood  mississippi during the second quarter of operating expenses totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
operating expenses consist of those expenses incurred in the operation and management of adult and juvenile correctional and detention facilities  and for our inmate transportation subsidiary 
salaries and benefits represent the most significant component of fixed operating expenses 
approximately of our operating expenses consist of salaries and benefits 
during  salaries and benefits expense at our correctional and detention facilities increased million from the increase in salaries and benefits expense was primarily due to the commencement of operations during january at six correctional facilities located in texas pursuant to management contracts awarded by the texas department of criminal justice tdcj  as well as marginal increases in staffing levels at numerous facilities across the portfolio to meet rising inmate population needs 
however  due to the increase in occupancy  actual salaries and benefits per compensated man day declined per compensated man day during as compared to the prior year  as we were able to leverage our salaries and benefits over a larger inmate population 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in utilities expense of per compensated man day due to rising energy costs across the country 
while we were successful in containing or reducing most types of variable expenses  the reduction in variable operating expenses per compensated man day to per compensated man day during from per compensated man day during was primarily due to a reduction in expenses related to legal proceedings in which we are involved  and a decrease in inmate medical expenses 
under the terms of the new texas management contracts  the tdcj retained responsibility for all inmate medical requirements 

table of contents the operation of the facilities we own carries a higher degree of risk associated with a management contract than the operation of the facilities we manage but do not own because we incur significant capital expenditures to construct or acquire facilities we own 
additionally  correctional and detention facilities have a limited or no alternative use 
therefore  if a management contract is terminated at a facility we own  we continue to incur certain operating expenses  such as real estate taxes  utilities  and insurance  that we would not incur if a management contract was terminated for a managed only facility 
as a result  revenue per compensated man day is typically higher for facilities we own and manage than for managed only facilities 
because we incur higher expenses  such as repairs and maintenance  real estate taxes  and insurance  on the facilities we own and manage  our cost structure for facilities we own and manage is also higher than the cost structure for the managed only facilities 
the following tables display the revenue and expenses per compensated man day for the facilities we own and manage and for the facilities we manage but do not own for the years ended december  owned and managed facilities revenue per compensated man day operating expenses per compensated man day fixed expense variable expense total operating margin per compensated man day operating margin average compensated occupancy managed only facilities revenue per compensated man day operating expenses per compensated man day fixed expense variable expense total operating margin per compensated man day operating margin average compensated occupancy the following discussions under owned and managed facilities and managed only facilities address significant events that impacted our results of operations for the respective periods  and events that will affect our results of operations in the future 
owned and managed facilities during january  we entered into an agreement with the state of vermont to manage up to inmates 
the contractual agreement represents the first time the state of vermont has partnered with the private corrections sector to provide residential services for its inmates 
the contractual terms provide for the out of state management of male  medium security vermont inmates primarily in two of our owned and managed prisons in kentucky  including lee adjustment center in beattyville  and marion adjustment center in st 
mary 
the influx of inmates from the state of vermont during  contributed million in additional revenue 

table of contents due to a combination of rate increases and or an increase in population at four of our facilities  including our  bed central arizona detention center   bed florence correctional center   bed san diego correctional facility  and bed dc correctional treatment facility  primarily from the usms  the ice  and the district of columbia  total management revenue increased during from the comparable period in  by million at these facilities 
during july  an inmate disturbance at the crowley county correctional facility located in olney springs  colorado resulted in damage to the facility  requiring us to immediately transfer approximately inmates to other of our facilities and approximately inmates to facilities owned by the state of colorado 
as of december   repair of the facility was substantially complete 
revenues lost as a result of the transfer of inmates to the state of colorado are expected to be mitigated by insurance 
it is possible  however  that certain incremental costs resulting from the incident  and or a portion of lost revenues  will not be recovered 
further  the timing of insurance recoveries and the further reduction of colorado inmate populations since the disturbance has impacted  and management believes will continue to impact  short term results 
during the third quarter of  we transferred all of the wisconsin inmates currently housed at our  bed medium security north fork correctional facility located in sayre  oklahoma to our  bed medium security diamondback correctional facility located in watonga  oklahoma in order to satisfy a contractual provision mandated by the state of wisconsin 
as a result of the transfer  north fork correctional facility will remain closed for an indefinite period of time 
accordingly  total management revenue decreased by million at this facility during compared with we are currently pursuing new management contracts and other opportunities to take advantage of the beds that became available at the north fork correctional facility  but can provide no assurance that we will be successful in doing so 
during  as expected  the state of wisconsin reduced the number of inmates housed at both our diamondback correctional facility and our prairie correctional facility by opening various facilities owned by the state 
as further discussed below  the available beds at diamondback correctional facility  which resulted from the declining inmate population from the state of wisconsin  have been substantially filled with inmates from the state of arizona 
as of december   the state of wisconsin housed inmates at the prairie correctional facility  compared with approximately  wisconsin inmates held at various facilities at december  during may  we announced the completion of new agreements with the states of minnesota and north dakota to house portions of those states inmates at the  bed prairie correctional facility 
under the minnesota agreement  we are managing an unspecified number of medium security  male inmates at the prairie facility 
the population will fluctuate based on the state s needs and the space available at the prairie facility 
the terms of the contract include an initial one year period through june   with two one year renewal options 
the north dakota agreement  which became effective in march  had an initial term through february with an indefinite number of annual renewal options 
the state of north dakota has not yet exercised its option to renew the contract 
however  we continue to house inmates under the contract and expect to receive notification of the renewal in the short term 
this contract  similar to the minnesota agreement  does not indicate a specific inmate population to be managed by us and is also expected to vary based on the state s needs and space availability 
while inmates received pursuant to these contracts will partially offset the reduction in inmate populations from wisconsin  in the near term we do not expect these inmate populations to reach the levels previously housed at this facility from wisconsin 
at december   we housed minnesota and north dakota inmates 
we also housed inmates from the state of washington at this facility pursuant to a contract awarded mid  as further described below 

table of contents during march  we entered into an agreement with the state of arizona to initially manage  arizona inmates 
the contractual terms provide for the out of state management of male  medium security arizona inmates at our diamondback correctional facility 
the initial contract term ended june   corresponding with arizona s fiscal year  and was renewed for one year on july  the contract allows for two more one year extension options 
as of december   we housed inmates from the state of arizona at this facility 
during april  we resumed operations at our  bed northeast ohio correctional center located in youngstown  ohio 
we are managing federal prisoners from united states federal court districts that are experiencing a lack of detention space and or high detention costs 
as of december   we housed federal prisoners at this facility 
the operating revenues for were million while the operating expenses were million and million for and  respectively  at our northeast ohio correctional center 
we believed that re opening this facility put us in a competitive position to win contract awards for the utilization of the facility 
on december   we received a contract award from the bop to house approximately  federal inmates at our northeast ohio correctional center 
the contract  awarded as part of the criminal alien requirement phase solicitation car  provides for an initial four year term with three two year renewal options 
the terms of the contract provide for a guaranteed rate of occupancy for days following a notice to proceed  and a guaranteed rate of occupancy thereafter 
we expect to begin receiving bop inmates at this facility in the second quarter of during june  we announced our first inmate management contract with the state of alabama to house up to  medium security inmates in our tallahatchie county correctional facility  located in tutwiler  mississippi  under a temporary emergency agreement to provide the state of alabama immediate relief of its overcrowded prison system 
the facility began receiving inmates in july prior to receiving inmates from the state of alabama  this facility was substantially idle 
during january  we received notice from the alabama department of corrections that it would withdraw its inmates housed at the facility 
although the alabama department of corrections withdrew all of their inmates from this facility by mid march  staffing levels were not reduced significantly at the facility due to negotiations with several potential customers to utilize the beds that became available at this facility 
the facility incurred operating losses during and including depreciation and amortization of million and million  respectively of million and million  respectively 
during may  we announced the completion of a contractual agreement to house inmates from the state of hawaii at the tallahatchie county correctional facility 
the new agreement expires on june  in addition  during july we extended our current contracts to house hawaiian inmates in our owned and operated diamondback correctional facility  and our florence correctional facility  located in florence  arizona for two additional years 
effective august   the combined contracts guarantee a minimum monthly average of  inmates to be housed at these three facilities 
as of december   we housed  hawaiian inmates at these three facilities  including inmates at the tallahatchie county correctional facility 
in addition  during june  we announced the completion of a contractual agreement to house up to maximum security inmates from the state of colorado at the tallahatchie county correctional facility 
the terms of the contract include a one year agreement effective through june   with four one year renewal options 
as of december   we housed inmates from the state of colorado at the tallahatchie county correctional facility 
in addition  during october  we announced the completion of a contractual agreement with the mississippi department of corrections 
we expect to manage an initial population of of the 
table of contents state s maximum security inmates at the tallahatchie facility 
the terms of the contract include an initial period which concludes on june   and includes three one year renewal options 
as of december   we housed mississippi inmates at the tallahatchie county correctional facility 
during july  we announced the completion of a contractual agreement with the state of washington department of corrections 
we expect to continue managing male  medium security inmates at our prairie correctional facility and our florence correctional facility pursuant to this contract 
the terms of the contract include an initial one year period through june   with an unspecified number of renewal options 
as of december   we housed washington inmates at two of our facilities 
we have been notified by the state of indiana that during the second quarter of it will remove all of its inmates from our bed otter creek correctional facility located in wheelwright  kentucky to utilize available capacity within the state s correctional system 
as of december   we housed indiana inmates at the otter creek correctional facility 
we are currently negotiating with existing customers  as well as new customers  to take advantage of the beds that will become available at this facility  but can provide no assurance that we will be successful in replacing the inmates that will be removed from this facility or that the per diem from any such customers will yield as much cash flow as we generated from the state of indiana 
during the second quarter of  we expect to complete construction on our stewart county correctional facility 
although we currently do not have a contract to house inmates at the  bed facility  our decision to complete construction was based on anticipated demand from several government customers having a need for inmate bed capacity in the southeast region of the country 
however  we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in utilizing the increased bed capacity 
once construction is complete we will incur depreciation expense on the new facility and will cease capitalizing interest on this project  which will have a negative affect on our results of operations 
during  we capitalized million in interest costs incurred on this facility 
we estimate the book value of the facility to be approximately million upon completion of construction 
we also expect our occupancy percentage to decline slightly as a result of the additional vacant beds available at the stewart facility  if we are unable to utilize the beds when they are ready for use 
fixed expenses per compensated man day for our owned and managed facilities increased from during to during due primarily to an increase in fixed operating expense for salaries and benefits and utilities across the portfolio of facilities we manage

managed only facilities in november  we announced that the tdcj awarded us new contracts to manage six state correctional facilities  as part of a procurement re bid process 
the management contracts  all of which became effective january   consist of four jails and two correctional facilities 
based on the tdcj recommendation  we also retained our contract to manage the bartlett state jail  but were not awarded the contract to continue managing the  bed sanders estes unit located in venus  texas  which expired january  total management revenue increased million during compared with  due to the operation of these facilities  net of a reduction in revenue for the management contract not renewed 

table of contents total revenue per compensated man day and total variable expenses per compensated man day decreased for our managed only facilities primarily because we did not assume responsibility for medical services for inmates provided under terms of our new contracts with the tdcj 
eliminating this responsibility results in a lower per diem rate  however  it also reduces the risk that our profitability will be eroded in the future by increasing medical costs 
the new texas contracts accounted for approximately of the total revenue generated from the facilities we managed but did not own during on march   we announced the completion of a contractual agreement with mississippi s delta correctional authority to resume operations of the state owned  bed delta correctional facility located in greenwood  mississippi 
we managed the medium security correctional facility for the delta correctional authority from its opening in until the state closed the facility in  due to excess capacity in the state s corrections system

moss criminal justice center expires june rather than renew the contract pursuant to its renewal provisions  tulsa county  oklahoma  the owner of the facility  decided to solicit a request for proposal  or rfp  for the management of the facility 
we have provided a response to the rfp  but can provide no assurance that we will be selected for the continued management of this facility  or that a new contract would yield as much cash flow as our existing contract 
this facility contributed million in total revenue during general and administrative expense for the years ended december  and  general and administrative expenses totaled million and million  respectively 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate management salaries and benefits  professional fees and other administrative expenses  and increased from primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits  combined with an increase in professional services during compared with we have expanded our infrastructure over the past year to implement and support numerous technology initiatives  to maintain closer relationships with existing and potentially new customers in order to identify their needs  and to focus on reducing facility operating expenses 
while this has resulted in an annual increase in general and administrative expense  we believe our expanded infrastructure and investments in technology will provide long term benefits enabling us to provide enhanced quality service to our customers while creating scalable operating efficiencies 
during  we also incurred increasing expenses associated with a the implementation of certain tax strategies  which contributed to a reduction in income tax expense during  and b tax planning initiatives that we believe will lower our overall future effective tax rate 
see income tax expense hereafter for additional information 
we have also experienced increasing expenses over the prior year in complying with increasing corporate governance requirements  a significant portion of which was incurred to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of we also 
table of contents continue to evaluate the potential need to expand our corporate office infrastructure to help ensure the quality and effectiveness of our facility operations 
these initiatives could also lead to higher general and administrative expenses in the future 
interest expense  net interest expense was reported net of interest income and capitalized interest for the years ended december  and gross interest expense  net of capitalized interest  was million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and gross interest expense is based on outstanding borrowings under our senior bank credit facility  senior notes  senior notes  convertible subordinated notes payable balances  and amortization of loan costs and unused credit facility fees 
the decrease in gross interest expense from the prior year was primarily attributable to the aforementioned recapitalization and refinancing transactions completed during the second and third quarters of  which also resulted in a reduction to our preferred stock distributions from the prior year 
gross interest income was million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and gross interest income is earned on cash collateral requirements  a direct financing lease  notes receivable and investments of cash and cash equivalents

change in fair value of derivative instruments on may   million shares of common stock were issued  along with a million subordinated promissory note  in connection with the final settlement of the state court portion of our stockholder litigation settlement reached during the first quarter of under the terms of the promissory note  the note and accrued interest were extinguished in june once the average closing price of our common stock exceeded a termination price equal to per share for 
table of contents fifteen consecutive trading days following the note s issuance 
the terms of the note  which allowed the principal balance to fluctuate dependent on the trading price of our common stock  created a derivative instrument that was valued and accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas  as amended 
since we had previously reflected the maximum obligation of the contingency associated with the state portion of the stockholder litigation on the balance sheet  the extinguishment of the note in june resulted in a million non cash gain during the second quarter of income tax benefit expense during the years ended december  and  our financial statements reflected an income tax provision of million and an income tax benefit of million  respectively 
the income tax benefit during the year ended december  was primarily the result of our reversal of substantially all of the valuation allowance previously established for our deferred tax assets 
deferred income taxes reflect the available net operating losses and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
realization of the future tax benefits related to deferred tax assets is dependent on many factors  including our past earnings history  expected future earnings  the character and jurisdiction of such earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect utilization of our deferred tax assets  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
as further discussed under critical accounting policies income taxes  prior to december   we had not consistently demonstrated an ability to utilize our tax net operating losses within the carryforward period and therefore applied a valuation allowance to reserve substantially all of our net deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas as a result  our financial statements did not reflect a provision for income taxes  other than for certain state taxes 
however  at december   we concluded that it was more likely than not that substantially all of our deferred tax assets would be realized 
as a result  in accordance with sfas  substantially all of the valuation allowance applied to such deferred tax assets was reversed on december  accordingly  in the first quarter of we began providing a provision for income taxes at a rate on income before taxes equal to the combined federal and state effective tax rates using current tax rates 
during  the internal revenue service completed its field audit of our federal income tax return 
during the fourth quarter of  the audit results underwent a review by the joint committee on taxation  a division of the irs 
based on that review  the irs adjusted the carryback claims we filed on our and federal income tax returns  requiring us to repay approximately million of refunds we received during and as a result of tax law changes provided by the job creation and worker assistance act of a portion of our tax loss was deemed not to be available for carryback to and due to our restructuring that occurred between and however  we will carry this tax loss forward to offset future taxable income 
while the adjustment did not result in a loss of deductions claimed  we were obligated to repay the amount of the adjusted refund  plus interest of approximately million  or million after taxes  through december  these obligations were accrued in our consolidated financial statements as of december   and were paid during the first quarter of the repayment of the refund adjusted by the irs resulted in an increase in the amount of deferred tax assets reflected on our balance sheet for the incremental net operating losses made available to offset taxable income in the future 
prior to this finding by the irs  we expected to generate sufficient taxable income during to utilize our remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards 

table of contents although the increase in our net operating loss carryforwards resulting from the repayment effectively extends the date in which our net operating loss carryforwards are fully utilized  we nonetheless still expect to generate sufficient taxable income during to utilize all of our remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards 
as a result  the irs finding and corresponding payment effectively accelerated to the first quarter of the cash taxes we expected to pay more evenly throughout  having no material impact on the total estimated cash flows for during the fourth quarter of  we realized a net income tax benefit of million resulting from the implementation of tax planning strategies that are also expected to reduce our future effective tax rate 
additionally  we recorded an income tax benefit of million in the third quarter of which primarily resulted from a change in estimated income taxes associated with certain financing transactions completed during  partially offset by changes in our valuation allowance applied to certain deferred tax assets 
discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of  we were notified by the state of florida of its intention to not renew our contract to manage the bed okeechobee juvenile offender correctional center located in okeechobee  florida  upon the expiration of a short term extension to the existing management contract  which expired in december upon expiration of the short term extension  which occurred march   operation of the facility was transferred to the state of florida

additionally  the expiration of the contract resulted in the impairment of all goodwill previously recorded in connection with this facility  which totaled million  during the first quarter of these results are reported as discontinued operations 
on march   we were notified by the department of corrections of the commonwealth of virginia of its intention to not renew our contract to manage the  bed lawrenceville correctional center located in lawrenceville  virginia  upon the expiration of the contract  which occurred on march  during  the facility generated total revenue of million  and incurred total operating expenses of million

these results are reported as discontinued operations

these proceeds  net of taxes  are presented as discontinued operations for year ended december  due to operating losses incurred at the southern nevada women s correctional center  we elected to not renew our contract to manage the facility upon the expiration of the contract 
accordingly  we transferred operation of the facility to the nevada department of corrections on october  during and  the facility generated total revenue of million and million  respectively  and incurred total operating expenses of and million  respectively 

table of contents distributions to preferred stockholders for the years ended december  and  distributions to preferred stockholders totaled million and million 
following the completion of the common stock and notes offering in may  we purchased approximately million shares of series b preferred stock for approximately million pursuant to the terms of a cash tender offer 
the tender offer price for the series b preferred stock inclusive of all accrued and unpaid dividends was per share 
the tender premium payment of the difference between the tender price and the liquidation preference for the shares tendered was reported as a preferred stock distribution in the second quarter of during the second quarter of  we redeemed the remaining million outstanding shares of our series b preferred stock at a price of per share  plus accrued dividends to the redemption date 
also during the second quarter of  we redeemed million  or approximately  of our million shares of outstanding series a preferred stock at a price of per share plus accrued dividends to the redemption date as part of the recapitalization 
during the first quarter of  we redeemed the remaining million outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock at a price of per share  plus accrued dividends to the redemption date 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  during the year ended december   we generated net income available to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share  compared with a net loss available to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share  for the previous year 
contributing to the net income for compared to the previous year was an increase in operating income of million  from million during to million during the increase was due to the commencement of operations at our mcrae correctional facility in december and the acquisition of the crowley county correctional facility in january  as well as increased occupancy levels and improved margins 
net income available to common stockholders during was favorably impacted by an income tax benefit of million primarily due to the reversal of the valuation allowance previously established for our deferred tax assets 
weighted average common shares outstanding for includes the effect of our issuance of million shares in connection with the recapitalization in may contributing to the net loss for was a non cash charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting change for goodwill of million  or per diluted share  related to the adoption of sfas  in addition to expenses associated with debt refinancing transactions of million  or per diluted share  during the second quarter of the debt refinancing completed during also contributed to the reduction in net interest expense  from million during to million during the cumulative effect of accounting change and the costs of refinancing were partially offset by an aggregate income tax benefit of million  which included a cash income tax benefit of million recognized during the first quarter of related to a change in tax law that became effective in march  which enabled us to utilize certain of our net operating losses to offset taxable income generated in and in addition  million of the income tax benefit in was due to the reduction of the tax valuation allowance applied to certain deferred tax assets arising primarily as a result of tax deductions based on a cumulative effect of accounting change for tax depreciation reported on our federal income tax return

operating expenses consist of those expenses incurred in the operation and management of adult and juvenile correctional and detention facilities  and for our inmate transportation subsidiary 
salaries and benefits represent the most significant component of fixed operating expenses 
during  salaries and benefits expense increased million from the increase in salaries and benefits expense was primarily due to the arrival of inmates at the mcrae correctional facility beginning in december and the purchase of the crowley county correctional facility in january salaries and benefits per compensated man day increased per compensated man day during from we also experienced a trend of increasing insurance expense during compared with because we are significantly self insured for employee health  workers compensation  and automobile liability insurance  our insurance expense is dependent on claims experience and our ability to control our claims 
our insurance policies contain various deductibles and stop loss amounts intended to limit our exposure for individually significant occurrences 
however  the nature of our self insurance provides little protection for a deterioration in claims experience or increasing employee medical costs in general 
we continue to incur increasing insurance expense due to adverse claims experience primarily resulting from rising healthcare costs throughout the country 
we continue to develop new strategies to improve the management of our future loss claims  but can provide no assurance that these strategies will be successful 
additionally  general liability insurance costs have risen substantially since the terrorist attacks on september   and other types of insurance  such as directors and 
table of contents officers liability insurance  have increased due to several high profile business failures and concerns about corporate governance and accounting in the marketplace 
the reduction in variable operating expenses per compensated man day to per compensated man day during from per compensated man day during was primarily due to the renegotiation of our contract for food services 
we decided to outsource food services at almost all of the facilities we operate 
outsourcing our food services to one vendor for substantially all of the facilities we manage generated opportunities to produce economies of scale 
we also achieved reductions in inmate medical expenses primarily due to the renegotiation of our management contract for the correctional treatment facility located in the district of columbia  as well as through the negotiation of a national contract with our pharmaceutical provider and reduced reliance on outsourced nursing

owned and managed facilities on may   we were awarded a contract by the bop to house  federal detainees at our mcrae correctional facility located in mcrae  georgia 
the three year contract  awarded as part of the criminal alien requirement phase ii solicitation  or car ii  also provides for seven one year renewals 
the contract with the bop guarantees at least occupancy on a take or pay basis  and commenced full operations in december total management and other revenue at this facility 
table of contents was million during the year ended december  this facility did not reach an average physical occupancy of until october as a result  during much of  we benefited from a relatively low level of operating expense resulting from lower physical occupancies while generating revenue at the guaranteed occupancy rate 
as of december   the physical occupancy was 
while only million of management and other revenue was generated by this facility during  we incurred million of operating expenses during the year ended december  results for were also favorably impacted by the acquisition  on january   of the crowley county correctional facility  a  bed medium security adult male prison facility located in olney springs  crowley county  colorado 
as part of the transaction  we also assumed a management contract with the state of colorado and entered into a new management contract with the state of wyoming  and took over management of the facility effective january  during the third quarter of  we transferred all of the wisconsin inmates housed at our  bed medium security north fork correctional facility located in sayre  oklahoma to our  bed medium security diamondback correctional facility located in watonga  oklahoma in order to satisfy a contractual provision mandated by the state of wisconsin 
as a result of the transfer  north fork correctional facility will remain closed for an indefinite period of time 
we are currently pursuing new management contracts and other opportunities to take advantage of the beds that became available at the north fork correctional facility  but can provide no assurance that we will be successful in doing so 
the operational consolidations did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
however  long term  the consolidation will result in certain operational efficiencies 
additionally  during the second quarter of  the state of wisconsin approved legislation to open various prison facilities owned by the state 
the opening of these facilities led to a reduction in the number of inmates we house from the state of wisconsin at our diamondback correctional facility and our prairie correctional facility  totaling approximately  inmates at december  during october  we entered into a new agreement with hardeman county  tennessee  with respect to the management of up to  medium security inmates from the state of tennessee in the whiteville correctional facility

the facility began receiving inmates in july prior to receiving inmates from the state of alabama  this facility was substantially idle

the alabama department of corrections took custody of all of the inmates previously housed at the facility during the first quarter of based on the 
table of contents terms of the short term contract  alabama compensated us at a guaranteed rate of occupancy of the facility through march  fixed expenses per compensated man day for our owned and managed facilities decreased from during to during the aforementioned increase in fixed operating expense for salaries and benefits and insurance across the portfolio of facilities we manage  was partially offset by decreases in property tax expenses of million for  compared with  or a decrease of per compensated man day 
the decrease in property tax expense was primarily as the result of a successful settlement during the third quarter of of a property tax dispute at our northeast ohio correctional center 
further  as our occupancy levels increase  we are able to provide the same quality of services without proportionately increasing our staffing levels  resulting in reductions to our fixed expenses per compensation man day 
variable expenses per compensated man day for our owned and managed facilities decreased from during to for the aforementioned decrease in variable expenses for reduced food and medical expenses across the portfolio of facilities we manage was net of an increase in variable expenses for an increase in litigation expenses during compared with of million  or per compensated man day  at certain of our owned facilities for legal proceedings in which we are involved 
the amount of the increase was also due to the settlement during the first quarter of of a number of outstanding legal matters for amounts less than reserves previously established for such matters  which resulted in a reversal of litigation expenses during the first quarter of of million 
managed only facilities during the fourth quarter of  we committed to a plan to terminate a management contract at the southwest indiana regional youth village  a bed juvenile facility located in vincennes  indiana

moss criminal justice center 
the contract renewal included an increase in the per diem rate  and also shifted to tulsa county the burden of certain utility expenses  resulting in a modest improvement in profitability for the management of this facility during the year ended december   compared with 
table of contents general and administrative expense for the years ended december  and  general and administrative expenses totaled million and million  respectively 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate management salaries and benefits  professional fees and other administrative expenses  and increased from primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits  combined with an increase in professional services  during compared with these increases were net of a decrease of million incurred in in connection with the implementation of tax strategies to maximize opportunities created by a settlement with the irs with respect to our predecessor s federal income tax return combined with a change in tax law in march interest expense  net interest expense was reported net of interest income for the years ended december  and gross interest expense was million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and gross interest expense is based on outstanding indebtedness  net settlements on certain derivative instruments  and amortization of loan costs and unused credit facility fees 
the decrease in gross interest expense from the prior year was primarily attributable to the refinancing of our senior indebtedness completed on may   which resulted in a decrease in the interest rate spread on our senior bank credit facility and the redemption of a substantial portion of our senior notes 
further  the recapitalization and refinancing transactions completed during the second and third quarters of resulted in the elimination of the regular and contingent interest associated with million of convertible subordinated notes  a further reduction in the interest rate spread on the term portion of our senior bank credit facility  a reduction in the interest rate on our million convertible subordinated notes  and the repayment of the remaining balance of our senior notes  partially offset by additional borrowings used to repurchase and redeem a substantial portion of our preferred stock 
interest expense also decreased due to the termination of an interest rate swap agreement  lower amortization of loan costs  and a lower interest rate environment 
gross interest income was million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and gross interest income is earned on cash collateral requirements  a direct financing lease  notes receivable and investments of cash and cash equivalents 
expenses associated with debt refinancing and recapitalization transactions for the years ended december  and  expenses associated with debt refinancing and recapitalization transactions were million and million  respectively

change in fair value of derivative instruments on may   million shares of common stock were issued  along with a million subordinated promissory note  in connection with the final settlement of the state court portion of our stockholder litigation settlement 
under the terms of the promissory note  the note and accrued interest were extinguished in june once the average closing price of our common stock exceeded a termination price equal to per share for fifteen consecutive trading days following the note s issuance 
the terms of the note  which allowed the principal balance to fluctuate dependent on the trading price of our common stock  created a derivative instrument that was valued and accounted for under the provisions of sfas since we had previously reflected the maximum obligation of the contingency associated with the state portion of the stockholder litigation on the balance sheet  the extinguishment of the note in june resulted in a million non cash gain during the second quarter of income tax benefit during the years ended december  and  our financial statements reflected income tax benefits of million and million  respectively 
the income tax benefit during the year ended december  was primarily the result of our reversal of substantially all of the valuation allowance previously established for our deferred tax assets 
deferred income taxes reflect the available net operating losses and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
realization of the future tax benefits related to deferred tax assets is dependent on many factors  including our past earnings history  expected future earnings  the character and jurisdiction of such earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect utilization of our deferred tax assets  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
during the years ended december  and  we provided a valuation allowance to substantially reserve our deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas as a result  our financial statements did not reflect a provision for income taxes other than for certain state taxes 
however  at december   we concluded that it was more likely than not that substantially all of our deferred tax assets would be realized 
as a result  in accordance with sfas  the valuation allowance applied to such deferred tax assets was reversed 
the removal of the valuation allowance resulted in a significant non cash reduction in income tax expense during the fourth quarter of accordingly  beginning with the first quarter of  our financial statements reflect a provision for income taxes at the applicable federal and state tax rates on income before taxes 
the income tax benefit during the year ended december   primarily resulted from the job creation and worker assistance act of  which was signed into law on march  among other changes  the tax law extended the net operating loss carryback period to five years from two years for net operating losses arising in tax years ending in and  and allows use of net operating loss carrybacks and carryforwards to offset of the alternative minimum tax 
we experienced net operating losses during resulting primarily from the sale of assets at prices below the tax basis of such assets 
under terms of the new law  we utilized certain of these net operating losses to offset taxable income generated in and as a result of this tax law 
table of contents change in  we reported an income tax benefit and claimed a refund of million during the first quarter of  which was received in april on october   we entered into a definitive settlement with the irs in connection with the irs s audit of our predecessor s federal income tax return 
under the terms of the settlement  in consideration for the irs s final determinations with respect to the tax year  in december we paid million in cash to satisfy federal and state taxes and interest 
due to the change in tax law in march  the settlement created an opportunity to utilize any tax losses to claim a refund of a portion of the taxes paid 
we experienced tax losses during primarily resulting from a cumulative effect of accounting change in depreciable lives of property and equipment for tax purposes 
under terms of the new law  we utilized our net operating losses to offset taxable income generated in  which was increased substantially in connection with the settlement with the irs 
as a result of the tax law change in  combined with the adoption of an accounting change in the depreciable lives of certain tax assets  as of december  we claimed an income tax refund of million  which was received during the second quarter of the cumulative effect of accounting change in tax depreciation resulted in the establishment of a significant deferred tax liability for the tax effect of the book over tax basis of certain assets in the creation of such a deferred tax liability  and the significant improvement in our tax position since the original valuation allowance was established to reserve our deferred tax assets  resulted in the reduction of the valuation allowance  generating an income tax benefit of million during the fourth quarter of  as we determined that substantially all of these deferred tax liabilities would be utilized to offset the reversal of deferred tax assets during the net operating loss carryforward periods 
discontinued operations in late and early  we were provided notice from the commonwealth of puerto rico of its intention to terminate the management contracts at the bed multi security ponce young adult correctional facility and the  bed medium security ponce adult correctional facility  located in ponce  puerto rico  upon the expiration of the management contracts in february attempts to negotiate continued operation of these facilities were unsuccessful

the 
table of contents letters of credit are renewable annually 
we did not have any draws under any outstanding letters of credit during   or recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 or fin fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or in which equity investors do not bear the residual economic risks 
fin is effective for all entities other than special purpose entities no later than the end of the first period that ends after march  we have no investments in special purpose entities 
we adopted fin effective january  we have determined that our joint venture  agecroft prison management  ltd  or apm  is a variable interest entity vie  of which we are not the primary beneficiary 
apm has a management contract for a correctional facility located in salford  england 
all gains and losses under the joint venture are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
during  we extended a working capital loan to apm  which totaled million  including accrued interest  as of december  the outstanding working capital loan represents our maximum exposure to loss in connection with apm 
apm has not been  and in accordance with fin will not be  consolidated with our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
and amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt sfas r on july  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either for a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we have not yet determined the method we plan to adopt 

table of contents as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in the footnote  accounting for stock based compensation  in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had or will have a direct adverse effect on our operations 
many of our management contracts include provisions for inflationary indexing  which mitigates an adverse impact of inflation on net income 
however  a substantial increase in personnel costs  workers compensation or food and medical expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in the future to the extent that these expenses increase at a faster pace than the per diem or fixed rates we receive for our management services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is to changes in us interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk related to our senior bank credit facility  which had an outstanding balance of million as of december  the interest on our senior bank credit facility is subject to fluctuations in the market 
if the interest rate for our outstanding indebtedness under the senior bank credit facility was basis points higher or lower during the years ended december    and  our interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  would have been increased or decreased by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had outstanding million of senior notes with a fixed interest rate of  million of senior notes with a fixed rate of  and million of convertible subordinated notes with a fixed interest rate of 
because the interest rates with respect to these instruments are fixed  a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in order to satisfy a requirement of the senior bank credit facility we purchased an interest rate cap agreement  capping libor at prior to the applicable spread on outstanding balances of million through the expiration of the cap agreement on may   for a price of million 
we do not currently intend to enter into any additional interest rate protection agreements in the short term 
we may  from time to time  invest our cash in a variety of short term financial instruments 
these instruments generally consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of three months or less 
while these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase  a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates would not materially affect the value of these instruments
