see also  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock numerous factors may cause our total revenues and operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period 
these fluctuations increase the difficulty of financial planning and forecasting and may result in decreases in our available cash and declines in the market price of our stock 
competition the dso industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
wind river s primary competition comes from internal research and development departments of companies that develop device systems in house 
in many cases  companies that develop device systems in house have already made significant investments of time and effort in developing their own internal systems 
historically  the process of shifting to a commercial standard has been viewed as difficult  and was a decision typically made at the project level 
more recently  a number of in house departments have begun to use open source software  such as the linux operating system  as the first strategic step toward standardization 
today  the increasing software complexity associated with devices is forcing a strategic shift as many companies are making build versus buy decisions to optimize their own device software development 
the buy option  we believe  becomes increasingly attractive 
we also compete with commercial linux distributors such as montavista software  inc  lynuxworks 
com  timesys corporation  metrowerks a subsidiary of freescale seminconductor  inc  and others  and enterprise linux vendors such as suse linux  red hat and others 
as there continues to be increased adoption of linux in markets such as telecommunications and data communications  we believe there will be more standardization of the development cycle based on open source technologies  an initiative that is being driven by the osdl corporation specification and standardization for carrier grade linux 
this offers equipment manufacturers high availability of open system architecture for core and edge applications 
however  our competitive position could 
table of contents be affected as other embedded software solution vendors move to the middle ground and find new ways to be more open  leveling the playing field with linux  availability of source code  ability to create and maintain ip ownership  and the ability to compete on price with reduced upfront and production licensing options 
we also compete with independent software vendors  including microsoft corporation  mentor graphics  enea ose systems ab  lynxworks  green hills software  inc  and qnx software systems  ltd 
recently acquired by harman international  as well as a number of other vendors that address one or more segments of the device system design process 
some of the companies that develop device systems in house and some of these independent software vendors  such as microsoft corporation  may have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  sales and other resources and significantly greater name recognition than we do 
we also believe that critical competitive factors in the industry are based on the way customers and potential customers manage their process of software development 
key drivers to software development include managing limited internal resources  controlling costs  minimizing development time and limiting risks 
therefore  reliability  performance  price  product availability  architecture support and customer support may also represent competitive forces affecting our industry 
we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock we face intense competition in the dso industry  which could decrease demand for our products or cause us to reduce our prices  for a further description of factors that may impact our competitive position 
product development and engineering we believe that our success will continue to depend primarily on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product line  develop new products  maintain technological competitiveness and meet an ever expanding range of customer and market requirements 
as of january   our product development and engineering group included full time employees 
during fiscal  and  product development and engineering expenses were million  million and million  respectively  excluding capitalized software development costs 
during the fiscal years ended january   and  we incurred product and development and engineering expenses that qualified for capitalization of million  none and  respectively 
see strategic alliances above for information on research and development funded by third parties 
proprietary rights our success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary technology 
to protect our proprietary rights  we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws 
as a part of our regular business processes  we generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with employees  consultants  distributors  customers and corporate partners  as appropriate  and thereby limit access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
furthermore  our licensing agreements provide for protection of our intellectual property both in terms of source code handling and underlying intellectual property ownership of modifications to the wind river code 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock the rights we rely upon to protect the intellectual property underlying our products may not be adequate  which could enable third parties to use our technology and reduce our ability to compete 
as we progress with our open source strategy  we may increasingly rely on third party open source products that have been developed and made available for licensing under open source license terms 
certain open source licenses  such as the gnu general public license that applies to linux  generally permit anyone to copy  modify and distribute the software  subject only to the restriction that any resulting or derivative work that is made available to the public be licensed under those same terms instead of under our standard license terms 
therefore  
table of contents as we incorporate our open source strategy into our product development  although we will retain the copyrights to the code that we develop ourselves  our most valuable intellectual property with respect to derivative works from these licenses will be our collection of trademarks 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock we have adopted an open source strategy that may not be successful or may expose us to additional risks 
wind river is a registered trademark in the united states and other countries worldwide 
we have used  registered  and or applied to register specific trademarks and service marks to distinguish many of our products  technologies and services from those of our competitors in the us and in foreign countries and jurisdictions 
we enforce our trademark  service mark and trade name rights in the us and abroad 
we have filed and obtained a number of patents and patent applications in the united states and abroad that relate to various aspects of our products and technology 
as of january   we held issued patents in the united states  none of which have expired 
the expiration dates of these patents range from to while we believe that patent protection of our products is important  any patents obtained may not provide substantial protection or be of commercial benefit to us 
it is also possible that their validity will be challenged 
manufacturing our manufacturing operations consist of assembling  packaging and shipping the software products and documentation needed to fulfill each order 
outside vendors provide tape and cd duplication  printing of documentation and manufacturing of packaging materials 
we also manufacture and assemble our hardware development tools at our facility in canton  massachusetts and at certain subcontractor facilities 
employees as of january   we had  employees  including in sales and marketing  in professional services and support activities  in product development and engineering and in management  operations  finance and administration 
of these employees  were located in north america and were located outside of north america 
none of our employees in north america is represented by a labor union or is subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
we have never experienced a work stoppage 
our employees are vital to our success  and our key management  engineering  sales and other employees are difficult to replace 
we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees or maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees 
if we are unable to attract  assimilate  retain or motivate highly qualified technical and sales employees in the future through competitive compensation and employment policies  our ability to develop and introduce competitive new products in a timely manner may suffer

however  such matters involve complex questions of fact and law and could involve significant costs and the diversion of resources to defend 
additionally  the results of litigation are inherently uncertain  and an adverse outcome is at least reasonably possible 
on june   we filed a complaint against green hills software  inc green hills  a direct competitor  in the superior court of california  county of alameda 
the subsequently amended complaint requested in excess of  in damages due to breach by green hills of a cooperative marketing and technology agreement entered into between the parties in october on january   green hills filed a complaint against us in the united states district court for the central district of california alleging  among other things  that we violated antitrust and unfair competition laws by allegedly refusing to license our vxworks product to green hills and refusing to market vxworks separately from the integrated development environment ide for vxworks 
green hills requested an award for damages and injunctive relief on these matters 
no opinion has yet been issued following a hearing held on april  in response to wind river s motion to dismiss and green hills motion for preliminary injunction regarding trademark issues 
these related lawsuits are still in the preliminary stages  and it is not possible for us to quantify the extent of potential liability to green hills  if any  resulting from the green hills lawsuit

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive operating and financial summary wind river is a global leader in device software optimization dso 
our software is used to develop and run devices better  faster  at a lower cost and more reliably 
our software and development tools are used to optimize the functionality of devices as diverse as digital imaging products  automobile braking systems  internet routers  avionics control panels and factory automation equipment 
wind river offers customers dso solutions to enhance product performance  standardize designs across projects and throughout the enterprise  reduce research and development costs and shorten product development cycles 
how we earn our revenues we earn our revenues from the license and sale of our products and from providing services related to our products 
our software products are licensed to our customers for their development use under either a subscription license or a perpetual license which assists them in the overall development process of their devices 
customers who purchase a subscription license  also referred to as an enterprise license  are charged per term eg an annual fee  renewable at the election of the customer 
customers who purchase a perpetual license are generally charged a one time  up front fee 
once development is completed  whether under a subscription license or a perpetual license  we also generally charge our customers a production license fee for every copy of our product included in the final  manufactured device 
customers either report their usage on a quarterly basis or purchase a block of production licenses in advance of use 
we also earn revenue for support and maintenance services for our products  which includes telephone support and provision of updates 
for products licensed under a perpetual license  support and maintenance may be purchased for a separate fee 
for products licensed under a subscription license  support and maintenance is included in the per term fee  and includes upgrades 
in addition  we also charge customers for other services related to our products  such as training and professional services 
our training services are generally purchased for a fixed fee  while our professional services are available on both a time and materials and fixed price contract basis 
our professional services are designed to assist our customers with the design and development of a completed device or application 
our product revenues are comprised of revenues from perpetual licenses  the revenues that we receive for all production licenses  whether related to development under a perpetual license or a subscription license  and hardware revenues 
our subscription revenues are derived from revenues from our subscription licenses  which includes support and maintenance provided to these customers 
our services revenues are derived from our training and professional services revenues  as well as revenues for support and maintenance of our products under perpetual licenses 
our licensing models we license our software using two primary licensing models  subscription based enterprise licensing and project based perpetual licensing 
our wind river platforms and workbench integrated development suite are primarily licensed under enterprise licensing 
our subscription based enterprise license model was first introduced in november this model includes subscription based development licenses that are typically one year in duration  although some licenses extend to periods greater than one year 
subscription enterprise licenses eliminate the more traditional project and site restrictions on the use of our products 
at the end of the subscription period  the customer s right to develop using wind river platforms or tools expires unless renewed 
most enterprise licenses i have an initial duration of one year  with annual renewals  ii include payment terms for the full cost of the annual subscription within days after entering into the enterprise license agreement  iii include production license reporting once a customer makes a commercial release of a device that incorporates our products  and iv may include a 
table of contents number of service credits for field engineering support 
during fiscal  some customers have entered into multi year strategic agreements with us 
these agreements have generally included payment terms for the full cost of the multi year subscription within days after entering into the enterprise licensing agreement 
in february  we introduced a variation on this model that includes a higher priced per seat subscription without a separate per unit production license fee  allowing our customers to choose between the shared success model that includes production license fees or a pure per seat subscription model without a separate production license fee 
to date  the majority of subscription licenses continue to include per unit production licenses fees  which aggregate volumes across the enterprise to create incentives for broader adoption 
however  we believe that offering certain variations of our enterprise licensing models allows our customers to have greater flexibility in meeting their business needs 
we also license our software under project based perpetual licenses 
under this model  our customers pay an up front  development license fee together with an annual maintenance fee that is based on a fixed percentage of the total licensing fees 
for device software products  the customer typically also pays a per unit  per project production license fee based on the number of copies of our operating system software that are included in final manufactured devices 
the terms of the perpetual license for our software restrict the customer s use to a specific project  such as a line of printers or digital camera and  as a result  any software licenses or prepaid production license fees can generally only be used on that specific project 
under our perpetual license model  we sell our products at the specific project level and are dealing primarily with the engineers leading and making decisions for individual projects 
the strategy for our wind river platform products is to seek enterprise wide adoption 
as a result  the customer s decision to adopt our products is now more strategic leading to longer sales lead times and ultimately more complex and time consuming negotiations 
our success is therefore dependent upon our ability to first educate our current and potential customers of the value associated with our wind river platform products and services and  secondly  our ability to negotiate and close such transactions with these customers on terms which are mutually agreeable 
due to the fact that a significant portion of our business is sold under the enterprise licensing model  our reported revenue in a given quarter does not necessarily reflect our level of business activity 
under the enterprise license model  revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period 
by contrast  under applicable accounting rules  a perpetual license requires the majority of license revenue to be recognized in the quarter in which the products are delivered and a much smaller amount relating to the fair value of maintenance being deferred and recognized subsequently over the maintenance period 
therefore  an order for an enterprise license will result in lower current quarter revenue than an equal sized order for a perpetual license  but will result in increased deferred revenue compared to the perpetual license 
we expect customers to continue to transition from perpetual licensing to the enterprise licensing in the coming fiscal year 
depending on the rate at which customers transition from our perpetual model to our enterprise license model  our reported revenue may continue to be impacted in the short term 
recent operating results during fiscal  we returned to profitability and positive cash flow from operations  following our focus on growth in revenue and deferred revenue and our focus on cost containment 
growth in revenue and deferred revenue was primarily driven by an increase in our enterprise licensing business arising from additional focus on our dso strategy and an improvement in the overall economy and production license revenues which more than offset decreases in revenue from our perpetual license sales and maintenance 
we also repaid our million term loan in the second quarter of fiscal and repurchased million of our convertible subordinated note in january see note convertible subordinated notes and other borrowings in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
our total revenues were million fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million or and decreased million or in fiscal compared to revenues of million 
table of contents in fiscal our net income was million or a net income of per fully diluted share in fiscal our net loss was million and million  or a net loss of per fully diluted share and per fully diluted share  in fiscal and  respectively 
our total deferred revenue has increased to million at january  from million at january   primarily as a result of continued increases in sales of wind river platforms and other enterprise license based products 
of the total deferred revenue balance at january   million relates to deferred revenue classified as long term 
this deferred revenue relates to the portion of multi year contracts that is due to be recognized as revenue in a time period greater than one year from the balance sheet date 
we generated cash flow from operations of million in fiscal compared to cash used in operations of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
acquisition on january   we acquired the assets and certain obligations of the scopetools business unit of real time innovations  inc rti 
total consideration for the transaction was million  comprising million in cash   shares of our common stock with a fair value of   in acquisition costs and  in assumed maintenance support costs 
we determined that  of the amount paid to rti as part of the purchase consideration related to royalty payments due rti under a pre existing distributor arrangement whereby we licensed the software of the scopetools business 
this amount was calculated in accordance with the terms of pre existing arrangement and has been recognized as cost of revenue and deducted from the purchase consideration 
the  shares and  in cash were placed in escrow for a period of months to indemnify us in case we incur certain liabilities in connection with the transaction 
in accordance with the purchase method of accounting as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
business combinations sfas no 
 we allocated the total consideration to the intangible assets and tangible liabilities acquired  based on their estimated fair values 
in performing the purchase price allocation of acquired intangible assets  we considered its intention for future use of the assets  analyses of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of the scopetools business unit  among other factors 
we used the income valuation approach in determining fair value using discount rates ranging from to 
of the purchase price  million was allocated to intangible assets and million was allocated to goodwill 
the intangible assets consist of existing technology of million  core technology of  maintenance agreements of  and non competition agreements of  and are being amortized over periods of two to seven years 
the goodwill of million represents our assigned value for the long term potential of the integration of the scopetools business unit into our overall product strategy 
the scopetools business unit s results of operations  which are not material to us  have been included in our results since the date of acquisition 
critical accounting policies and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
note  summary of significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated financial statements describes our significant accounting policies which are reviewed by us on a regular basis and which are also reviewed by senior management with the audit committee of our board of directors 
an accounting policy is deemed by us to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that 
table of contents reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
the policies and estimates that we believe are most critical to an understanding of our financial results and condition and that require a higher degree of judgment and complexity are revenue recognition  estimating sales returns and other allowances  and allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill and purchased intangibles  restructuring charges  accounting for income taxes  stock based compensation  and litigation contingencies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues from three sources product revenues  service revenues and subscription revenues  net of sales returns and other allowances 
product revenues consist of revenues from production licenses sometimes referred to as royalties  and fees for stand alone software and software programming tools sold under our perpetual licensing model and from sales of our hardware 
service revenues are derived from fees from professional services  which include design and development fees  software maintenance contracts  and customer training and consulting 
subscription revenues consist primarily of revenues from the licensing of products and services under our enterprise licensing model  including items such as development tools  an operating system  various protocols and interfaces and maintenance and support services such as installation and training  which are licensed over a limited period of time  typically months 
agreements generally do not allow the right of return or sales price adjustments 
we recognize revenues in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended sop  sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop  and staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition sab 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the vendor s fee is fixed or determinable and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe exists for all undelivered elements of the arrangement and collection is determined to be probable 
these four criteria are further defined as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
it is our customary practice to have non cancelable contracts and generally a customer purchase order prior to recognizing revenues on an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
product revenues for software and hardware are recognized at the time of shipment or upon the delivery of a product master  with standard transfer terms of fob shipping point 
if undelivered products or services exist that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an arrangement  delivery is not considered to have occurred 
if only non essential products or services are undelivered and if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the recognition of fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
we recognize revenues from time based and subscription based licenses ratably over the term of the agreement 
our enterprise license model agreements require that we deliver unspecified future updates and upgrades within the same product family during the subscription term 
accordingly  fees from our enterprise license agreements are recognized ratably over their term 

table of contents sales to original equipment manufacturers  system integrators and value added resellers are recognized at the time the risk of loss has transferred 
sales to distributors are generally recognized upon receipt of production reports related to the sale of product to an end user 
professional service revenues are separately priced  are generally available from a number of suppliers  and are typically not essential to the functionality of our software products 
revenues from these services are recognized separately from the license fee because the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined by sop generally  revenue from time and materials consulting contracts are recognized as services are performed 
contract accounting is utilized for service revenues from fixed price contracts and those requiring significant software modification  development or customization 
in such instances  the arrangement fee is accounted for in accordance with sop  whereby the arrangement fee is recognized  generally using the percentage of completion method measured on labor input costs 
if increases in projected costs to complete are sufficient to create a loss contract  the entire estimated loss is charged to operations in the period the loss first becomes known 
the complexity of the estimation process and judgments related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization  changes to specification and testing requirements and collectibility of unbilled receivables 
service revenues from software maintenance  support and update fees are recognized ratably over the contract period  typically months 
service revenues from training and consulting are recognized when the services are provided 
the vendor s fee is fixed or determinable 
at the time of each transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with a revenue transaction is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
for product and subscription revenues  if a significant portion of a fee is due after our standard payment terms  which are generally no greater than days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  revenue is recognized as the fees become due 
collection is probable 
we assess probability of collection based on a number of factors  including our past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
new customers and certain existing customers are subject to a credit review process that evaluates each customer s financial position and ultimately its ability to pay according to the original terms of the arrangement 
based on our review process  if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collection of the resulting receivable is not probable  then revenue is recognized on a cash collected basis 
vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we establish vsoe for subscription transactions and maintenance services by reference to substantive stated future renewal rates included in contracts or the amounts charged on similar transactions 
we establish vsoe for professional services time and materials contracts by reference to standard hourly rates charged for services 
we have not yet established vsoe for professional services fixed price contracts 
where such services are sold in conjunction with other products  significant management judgment is required to determine appropriate revenue recognition 
significant management judgments and estimates are made in connection with the revenues recognized in any accounting period 
we must assess whether the fee associated with a revenue transaction is fixed or determinable  whether vsoe exists for all elements of a transaction and the related revenue recognition impact of this  whether or not collection is probable and  for fixed price contracts  make estimates of costs to complete 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of revenues for any period if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
deferred revenues 
deferred subscription revenues represent customer billings made in advance for software licensed over a subscription period 
subscription periods vary from annual to multi year and are classified as such 
deferred service revenues include pre payments for software consulting and other product 
table of contents services  including software licenses transactions that are not segmentable from consulting services 
revenue for these services is recognized as the services are performed 
deferred maintenance and service revenues represent customer payments made in advance for annual support contracts 
maintenance is typically billed on a per annum basis in advance and revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
estimating sales returns and other allowances  and allowance for doubtful accounts we record estimated reductions in revenue for potential returns of products by customers and other allowances 
as a result  management must make estimates of potential future product returns and other allowances related to current period product revenue 
in making such estimates  management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates  material differences in the amount of our reported revenue could result 
the provision for sales returns and other allowances was million and million at january  and  respectively 
the decrease relates to an improvement in our historical rate of returns and allowances 
similarly  management makes estimates of the non collectibility of accounts receivables  specifically analyzing accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms  when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition to the identification of individual specific doubtful accounts receivable  we provide allowances for other accounts receivable based on our historical experience 
if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates  material differences in the amount of our reported operating expenses could result 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at january  and  respectively

valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill and purchased intangibles goodwill and purchased intangibles 
intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of entities accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are estimated by management based on the fair value of assets received 
these include acquired customer base  technological know how  trademarks and goodwill 
intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful lives ranging from one year to seven years on a straight line basis 
intangible assets acquired subsequent to june  have been accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
and have been amortized in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

for all other intangible assets  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
on february   which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but continue to be evaluated for impairment 
significant management judgment is involved in assessing the fair value of goodwill and purchased intangible assets received 
the primary methods used to determine the fair value of assets received is the income approach  under which we must make assumptions as to the future cash flows of the acquired entity or assets  the appropriate discount rate to use to present value the cash flows and the anticipated life of the acquired assets  and the market approach  under which we compare the value of our reporting unit to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business 
if we made different judgments  material differences in the amount of fair value assigned to purchased intangibles and goodwill could arise 
we review goodwill for impairment annually in the second quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
we currently operate as one reportable segment 
the primary methods used to determine the fair value of goodwill for impairment purposes were the income and market approaches 
goodwill was million and million and purchased intangibles were million and million at january  and  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal 
table of contents of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas no 
requires the recognition of the impairment of long lived assets when circumstances indicate an impairment has occurred and in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
accordingly  we evaluate asset recoverability when an event occurs that may impair recoverability of the asset 
we determine the recoverability of the carrying amount of each asset by reviewing the following factors the undiscounted value of expected operating cash flows in relation to its net capital investments  the estimated useful or contractual life of the asset  the contract or product supporting the asset 
in the case of purchased intangibles and capitalized software development costs  we periodically review the recoverability of the asset s value by evaluating its products with respect to technological advances  competitive products and the needs of its customers 
substantially all of our long lived assets  including goodwill  are located in north america 
the impairment charge for goodwill  purchased intangibles and other long lived assets is assessed based upon estimated discounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the goodwill  purchased intangibles or long lived assets using an appropriate discount rate that incorporates our cost of capital and the risk profile of the associated investment 
the assumptions supporting the cash flows  including the discount rates  are determined using our best estimates as of the date of the impairment review 
these estimates are highly subjective and require significant management judgment as these estimates require us to make assumptions regarding future operating results  which are inherently difficult to predict 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
for details about the impairment charges we recorded during fiscal and  see results of operations years ended january   and impairment of goodwill and purchased intangibles below 
restructuring charges 
in fiscal  and  restructuring charges consist of costs associated with restructuring programs implemented by us and costs associated with the settlement of litigation and related remediation efforts 
we account for the individual components of the restructuring activities as discussed further below 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

sfas no 
supersedes emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs associated with a restructuring eitf  and eitf issue no 
costs associated with lease modification or termination eitf 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january   therefore  our and restructuring activities were accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not impact our restructuring obligations recognized in connection with our restructuring activities initiated in fiscal  as these obligations continue to be accounted for in accordance with eitf and eitf and other applicable pre existing guidance 
the following is a summary of the accounting principles used to record and measure our  and restructuring activities and associated obligations and restructurings 
the expenses incurred in connection with our fiscal and restructuring are comprised principally of severance and associated employee termination costs related to the reduction of our workforce  an office closure and for employee litigation as a result of previous restructurings 
the employee litigation relates to alleged wrongful termination 
these activities have been accounted for primarily in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  as opposed to when management commits to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also requires that i liabilities associated with exit and disposal activities be measured at fair value  ii one time termination benefits be expensed at the date the entity notifies the employee  unless the employee must provide future service  in which case the benefits are expensed ratably over the future service period  and iii costs to terminate a contract specifically an operating lease before the end of its term be 
table of contents recognized when the entity terminated the contract in accordance with the contract terms 
the employee litigation charges were accounted for in accordance with sfas no  accounting for contingencies 
a small portion of our restructuring costs for fiscal and have been accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for postemployment benefits  an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  sfas no 

we applied sfas no 
to a small number of international employees where we have historically provided termination benefits based on local statutory regulations 
accordingly  we record the liability related to these termination costs when we determine that they are both probable and estimable  which is generally when i we approve a termination plan that commits us to such plan and establishes the benefits the employees will receive upon termination  ii the plan specifically identifies the number of employees to be terminated  their locations and their job classifications  and iii the period of time to implement the plan does not indicate changes to the plan are likely 
restructuring 
restructuring obligations incurred prior to the adoption of sfas no 
in fiscal were accounted for and continue to be accounted for in accordance with eitf  sab restructuring and impairment charges sab and eitf the expenses incurred in connection with our restructuring are comprised primarily of i severance and associated employee termination costs related to the reduction of our workforce  ii consolidation of excess facilities  and iii impairment costs associated with certain other assets 
we accounted for the individual components of the restructuring as follows severance and associated employee termination costs 
in accordance with eitf and sab  we recorded the liability related to these termination costs when the following conditions had been met i management with the appropriate level of authority approves a termination plan that commits us to such plan and establishes the benefits the employees will receive upon termination  ii the benefit arrangement is communicated to the employees in sufficient detail to enable the employees to determine the termination benefits  iii the plan specifically identifies the number of employees to be terminated  their locations and their job classifications  and iv the period of time to implement the plan does not indicate changes to the plan are likely 
the termination costs recorded by us are not associated with  nor do they benefit  continuing activities 
consolidation of excess facilities 
we accounted for the costs associated with the consolidation of excess facilities in accordance with eitf  and accordingly  we recorded the costs associated with excess facilities when the related leased property had no substantive future use or benefit to us 
our estimated excess facility costs represent the remaining lease payments and estimated costs less estimated proceeds from subleasing certain facilities 
the estimated proceeds from subleasing these facilities are based on current comparable rates for leases in the respective markets 
impairment costs associated with certain other assets 
during fiscal  we recorded a charge of million related to certain other assets  primarily assets associated with certain products that management decided to discontinue as a result of its restructuring programs 
we review the status of restructuring activities on a quarterly basis and  if appropriate  record changes to restructuring obligations as part of operating expenses based on management s most current estimates 
restructuring charges in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
inherent in the estimation of the costs related to our restructuring efforts are assessments related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to accomplish the restructuring 
in determining our restructuring charges  the majority of estimates made by management related to our charges for excess facilities 
in determining the charge for excess facilities  we were required to estimate future sublease income  negotiated lease settlement costs  future net operating expenses of the facilities  and brokerage commissions  among other expenses 
these estimates  along with other estimates made by management in connection with our restructuring  may vary significantly depending  in part  on factors that may be beyond our control 
specifically  these estimates will depend on our success in negotiating with lessors  the time periods required to locate and contract 
table of contents suitable subleases and the market rates at the time of such subleases 
adjustments to our reserve for the consolidation of excess facilities will be required if actual lease exit costs or sublease income differ from amounts currently expected 
we review the status of our restructuring activities on a quarterly basis and  if appropriate  record changes to our restructuring obligations as part of operating expenses based on management s most current estimates 
accounting for income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  income tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
judgment is applied to estimate taxable income by jurisdiction and our ability to utilize any unexpired credits and or net operating losses 
we are subject to income tax audits in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate and  as a result  must also assess exposures to any potential issues arising from current or future audits of current and prior years tax returns 
accordingly  we must assess such potential exposure and  where necessary  provide a reserve to cover any expected loss 
to the extent that we establish a reserve  our provision for income taxes would be increased 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
during the year ended january   we realized a benefit of million arising from the final assessment of a foreign tax audit 
our tax rate may also vary based on our results and the mix of income or loss amongst the domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
deferred income taxes are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
and are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using the tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
sfas no 
provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if the realization of such assets is more likely than not to occur 
we have recorded a valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  in all jurisdictions apart from germany  primarily relating to certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
this determination has been made based on available evidence  including our historical levels of taxable income 
should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future  an adjustment to our deferred tax assets would cause a material increase to income in the period such determination was made 
significant management judgment is required in determining the period in which the reversal of a valuation allowance should occur 
factors that we must consider in making this determination include historical levels and future forecasts of taxable income among other items 
the valuation allowance at january  and was million and million  respectively 
management continues to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances 
stock based compensation sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  currently encourages  but does not require  companies to record compensation cost for stock based employee compensation plans at fair value 
we have continued to account for stock based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method 
under that method  compensation cost for stock options granted to employees is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
however  as of february   we will be required to apply fasb statement r  share based payment  which will require us to measure compensation cost for all share based payments at fair value 
litigation contingencies we are involved from time to time in various proceedings  lawsuits and claims involving our customers  products  intellectual property  stockholders and employees  among other things 
quarterly  we review the status 
table of contents of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
results of operations for the years ended january   and revenues we recognize revenues from three sources product revenues  service revenues and subscription revenues  net of sales returns and other allowances 
product revenues consist of revenues from production licenses sometimes referred to as royalties  and fees for stand alone software and software programming tools sold under our perpetual licensing model and from sales of our hardware 
service revenues are derived from fees from professional services  which include design and development fees  software maintenance contracts  and customer training and consulting 
subscription revenues consist of revenues from the licensing of products and services under our enterprise licensing model including items such as development tools  an operating system  various protocols and interfaces and maintenance and support services such as installation and training  which are licensed over a limited period of time  typically months 
years ended january  percentage of total revenues  net in thousands  except percentages product revenues subscription revenues service revenues total revenues  net total revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased in fiscal compared to the increase in total revenues in fiscal compared to was primarily due to higher customer demand for our software and hardware  improvements in production license revenues and increased investments in device software optimization solutions as a result of an improvement in the overall economy 
see factors that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock 
the decrease in total revenues in fiscal compared to was due to lower customer demand for hardware and software products  including revenues from production licenses  which are generally tied to the number of devices deployed by our customers 
this lower customer demand was mainly a result of the continuing economic downturn in the high technology sector  which started during fiscal and continued through fiscal our product and service revenues  in particular maintenance revenues  have also been affected as the result of the transition of some of our customers to our wind river platforms 
fees from the wind river platforms are recorded as subscription revenue ratably over the license term  which is typically one year 
in contrast under our perpetual model  a significant percentage of the transaction fee is recognized in the quarter the transaction is completed 
while this has impacted  and will continue to impact  our revenues in the short term as customers transition to the wind river platforms  our deferred revenues have increased to million at january  from million at january   primarily as a result of the transition of business to our wind river platforms 

table of contents product revenues 
product revenues are comprised of perpetual license revenues  including hardware revenues  and production license revenues from perpetual and subscription licensing 
the table below sets forth information for such components 
years ended january  percentage of total revenues  net in thousands  except percentages perpetual license revenues production license revenues total product revenues perpetual license revenues declined in fiscal compared to fiscal and declined in fiscal compared to fiscal perpetual license revenues have decreased as a percentage of revenue in fiscal and compared to fiscal due to the transition to our wind river platforms  which are accounted for as subscription revenues 
we expect perpetual licenses and hardware revenues to continue to decline as the transition to our wind river platforms continues 
production license revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal and declined in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase in fiscal was primarily due to our customers manufacturing more embedded devices that include our technology  especially in the digital consumer and networking segments  improvement in our execution in the area of customer compliance and reporting and improvement in our customers own quarterly reporting processes 
subscription revenues 
subscription revenues were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of 
the significant increase in fiscal in subscription revenues resulted from the continued transition of a number of our customers from our traditional perpetual licensing model to our wind river platforms under the enterprise license model and increasing business activity levels 
we expect that subscription revenues will continue to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the future 
fiscal was the first full fiscal year in which we sold our wind river platform products under the enterprise license model 
the transition of customers to enterprise license model will continue to affect the level of our overall revenues because we recognize fees under this business model ratably as opposed to our perpetual model where a significant proportion of the fee is recognized at the time the transaction is completed 
service revenues 
service revenues are derived from fees for professional services  which include design and development fees  software maintenance contracts  customer training and consulting 
years ended january  percentage of total revenues  net in thousands  except percentages maintenance revenues other service revenues total service revenues maintenance revenues declined in fiscal compared to fiscal  and declined in fiscal compared to fiscal the decline in fiscal is primarily due to the continued transition of our customers to our wind river platforms  which include maintenance as a part of the subscription fee 
we expect 
table of contents maintenance revenues will continue to decline as our customers transition to our wind river platforms continues 
other service revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal and declined in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal was due to an increase in professional service revenues 
in addition to the impact from the general economic environment  other service revenues were also impacted in fiscal due to a disruption in services backlog arising from a reorganization of our sales force 
during fiscal year and  we generated million and million in revenue from fixed price services contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting  respectively 
the majority of other service revenues are related to time and materials services contracts  which are recognized as the related services are performed 
revenues by geography years ended january  percentage of total revenues  net in thousands  except percentages north america emea japan asia pacific total revenues  net revenues from international sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and decreased from million in fiscal the increase is due to a increase in revenues from emea  a increase in revenues from japan  and a increase in revenues from asia pacific  between fiscal and the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a decrease in revenues from emea  a decrease in revenues from japan  and a decrease in revenues from asia pacific  between fiscal and international revenues increased as a percentage of revenues between fiscal and primarily due to international revenues increasing at a faster rate than north american revenues 
international revenues increased in absolute dollars primarily due to increases in subscription revenues and production license revenues in all international geographies 
the impact of foreign exchange rate movements did not have a significant impact on international revenues during fiscal the decrease in international revenues between fiscal and resulted primarily from the same macroeconomic factors that have impacted our business in north america and have caused our customers to reduce their research and development spending and purchase fewer of our products and services 
our international revenues have also been affected as the result of the transition of some of our customers to our wind river platforms  in which revenue is recognized ratably as opposed to being recognized immediately under our perpetual license model 
international revenues accounted for  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect international sales to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues  although the actual percentage may fluctuate from period to period 
our international sales are generally denominated in united states dollars  euro  united kingdom sterling or japanese yen

the growth in subscription deferred revenues results from the continued transition from our traditional perpetual licensing model to our wind river platforms enterprise license model and increasing business activity levels 
the growth in deferred revenues for subscriptions during fiscal corresponds to the increase in subscription revenue 
the growth in deferred revenues for maintenance and other during fiscal corresponds to the growth in our software consulting services revenue 
cost of revenues years ended january  percentage of associated revenues  net in thousands  except percentages product subscription service amortization of purchased intangibles total cost of revenues gross margin gross margin percentage the general decline in overall costs of products and services was due to lower fixed costs such as employee costs  consulting cost and manufacturing and distribution costs arising from our restructuring activities during fiscal  and and also cost of product and cost of services have decreased in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to the transition to our wind river platforms  which are accounted for as cost of subscription 
cost of product 
product related costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits for production employees  other direct production costs  amortization of capitalized software development costs  royalty payments to third parties for the use of their software  and shipping costs 
cost of products decreased by  or million  in fiscal compared to fiscal and by  or million  in fiscal compared to fiscal the

direct production costs were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
amortization of capitalized software development costs in fiscal  and amounted to   and  respectively  and third party royalty costs for fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the decline in product related costs as a percentage of product revenues in the fiscal compared to fiscal was related to the increased allocation to subscription and increased production license revenues that have only marginal cost of product 
the decline in product related costs as a percentage of product revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was related to the decline in production costs resulting from our restructuring activities taken in fiscal and product related cost of revenues may be affected in the future by costs of distribution related to the introduction of new products  royalty costs for use of third party software in our products and by the amortization of capitalized software development costs 
cost of subscription 
subscription related costs of revenues consists primarily of subscription related costs  including salaries and benefits for production employees  other direct production costs  amortization of capitalized software development costs  royalty payments to third parties for the use of their software  shipping costs and costs of providing subscription related maintenance and support services 
cost of subscriptions increased  or million  in fiscal compared to fiscal and million  in fiscal compared to fiscal subscription related production costs were million  million and  during fiscal  and  respectively 
subscription related maintenance and support services costs were million  million and  during fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars in subscription costs in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the higher allocation of maintenance and support services costs and higher production costs and as a result of the related increase in subscription revenue 
the increase in absolute dollars in subscription costs in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to fiscal being the first full year in which we sold our wind river platforms under the enterprise license model 
the decrease in cost of subscription revenues as a percentage of subscription revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to fixed costs  such as production and maintenance salaries  being absorbed by a higher revenue base 
the increase in cost of subscription revenues as a percentage of subscription revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the fact that our wind river platforms include a higher mixture of services costs which traditionally carry a proportionally lower gross margin 
we expect costs of subscriptions to continue to fluctuate as a percentage of subscription revenue based on the level of sales of our wind river platforms and the continued transition of existing customers from our perpetual based licensing to the enterprise license model 
cost of subscriptions may be affected in the future by the direct production costs  amortization of capitalized software development costs  costs of distribution  royalty costs for use of third party software in our products  and the costs of providing subscription related maintenance and support services 
cost of services 
service related cost of revenues consist primarily of personnel related costs associated with providing services  including consulting services  to customers and the infrastructure to manage a services organization  as well as costs to recruit  develop and retain services professionals 
cost of services decreased by  or million  in fiscal compared to fiscal and by  or million  in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in absolute dollars of service costs in fiscal compared to fiscal and in fiscal compared to fiscal  was primarily due to reduced use of outside consultants and a reduction of full time employees as part of the restructuring programs implemented beginning fiscal and through fiscal we realized overall cost reductions of million and million in professional service costs relating primarily to internal payroll and external contractor costs  savings of  and million in training costs  and increased costs of  and savings of million in maintenance costs in fiscal compared to fiscal  and fiscal compared to fiscal  respectively 
in addition  cost of service revenues decreased as a percentage of services revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal due in part to the transition to our wind river platforms which are accounted for as costs of subscriptions 
we expect cost of services to continue to fluctuate as a percentage of service revenue based on our ability to fully utilize our professional services organization 

table of contents amortization of purchased intangibles 
amortization of purchased intangibles relates to amortization of completed technology acquired through purchase transactions 
the decreases in amortization in fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal were due to a lower amortizable base of purchased intangible assets 
in january  we acquired the assets and obligations of the scopetools business unit of real time innovations  inc and recorded million in completed technology which is expected be amortized to cost of revenue over a four year period 
operating expenses we allocate the total costs for information technology  facilities and fixed asset depreciation to each of the functional areas based on worldwide headcount data 
information technology allocated costs includes salaries  employee related costs  outside consulting costs for projects  communication costs  hardware and software maintenance contracts costs and depreciation expense for fixed assets 
facilities allocated costs include facility rent for the corporate offices as well as shared function offices  property taxes  depreciation expenses for office furniture and other department operating costs 
fixed asset depreciation allocated costs includes straight line depreciation expense on buildings  leasehold improvements  computer equipment  software  furniture and office equipment 
the general decline in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in selling and marketing  product development and engineering and general and administrative costs as shown below  for fiscal years and  and to a lesser extent  was due in a large part to the restructuring programs and cost control measures we implemented over the past few years  which led to decreased overall costs  primarily payroll related expenses  consulting expenses  general operating expenses  such as travel costs and reduced depreciation expenses arising from reduced capital expenditures 
in fiscal compared to fiscal  revenues increased at a faster rate than selling and marketing and product development and engineering costs causing the decrease in these costs as a percentage of revenue 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of product and other marketing related expenses  compensation related expenses  sales commissions  facility costs and travel costs 
percentage change percentage change in thousands  except percentages selling and marketing as a percentage of total revenues the increase in selling and marketing expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was or million 
this increase was attributable to higher salaries and related fringe benefit costs of million due to an increased investment in the sales organization  higher sales commissions of million  due to an increase in revenue and higher distributor commissions of  due to increased use of distributor and sales agents and higher advertising and marketing costs of  the increases were offset by a reduction in depreciation expense of million  due to a lower depreciable base of short lived fixed assets and million due to a decrease in rent and other facility costs 
the decrease in selling and marketing expenses from fiscal to fiscal was or million 
the decrease was attributable to lower sales commission expenses as a result of decreased sales volume and decreased expenditures due to the restructuring programs implemented during fiscal and in addition  salaries and related fringe benefits costs decreased by million  sales commission costs decreased by million  travel expenses decreased by million  consulting expenses decreased by million  depreciation expenses decreased million and rent and utilities decreased by million  in fiscal compared to fiscal we expect an increase in selling and marketing expenses in absolute dollars in both the short and long term as we continue to focus on long term growth in the areas of sales and marketing personnel and marketing and advertising programs

percentage change percentage change in thousands  except percentages product development and engineering as a percentage of net revenues the increase in product development and engineering expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was or million 
this increase was primarily attributable to higher salaries and fringe benefits of million  the addition of an engineering incentive program totaling million and an increase in consulting and outside costs of  these increases were offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of million due to a lower base of depreciable assets and savings in several other areas 
additionally  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  we capitalized million of product development expenses in fiscal in connection with the release of vxworks and workbench  both of which were major product releases for us 
the related costs will be amortized over the next two years as a component of cost of revenues 
the decrease in product development and engineering expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was or million 
the decrease in absolute dollars of product development and engineering expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to cost control measures relating to our restructuring programs 
salaries and fringe benefits costs decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  depreciation expense decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a lower depreciable base of our short lived fixed assets 
we received million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  respectively  of third party funded research and development which offset a portion of our gross research and development expenses 
in the short term  dollars received for funded research and development accounted for as an offset to gross product development and engineering expenses may vary depending on the timing and nature of work performed under these programs 
in the long term  we expect the dollars received for funded research and development to be reduced significantly as our programs wind down 
we expect that product development and engineering expenses in absolute dollars will not increase significantly in the short term

the decrease in general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was or million primarily due to cost control measures relating to our restructuring programs implemented in fiscal and fiscal due to these restructuring plans  we realized million in payroll related cost reductions and realized million in legal and accounting costs  primarily as a result of lower legal costs resulting from our restructuring plans  and from having incurred  of legal costs in fiscal relating to an employee litigation matter 
the decrease in costs in fiscal was offset by million in stock compensation charges associated with the 
table of contents separation of our former chief executive officer  thomas st 
dennis 
we believe that general and administrative expenses will not increase significantly in the short term 
however  we do expect an increase in absolute dollars in the long term  as we invest in worldwide staff and infrastructure in the areas of information systems and finance and administration 
goodwill 
we performed our annual test for goodwill impairment as required by sfas no 
as of june  we currently operate in one reportable segment  which is also the only reporting unit for the purposes of sfas the primary methods used to determine the fair values for sfas impairment purposes were the income and market approach 
the income approach provides an estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit based on the discounted cash flows derived from the reporting unit s estimated remaining life plus any residual value 
the market approach indicates the fair value of a reporting unit based upon a comparison to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business 
the assumptions supporting the income approach  including the discount rate  which was assumed to be  were determined using our best estimates as of the date of the impairment review

in january  we acquired the assets and obligations of the scopetools business unit of real time innovations  inc and recorded  in intangible assets  other than goodwill which are expected to be amortized to operating expenses over a two to seven year period 
impairment of purchased intangibles percentage change percentage change in thousands  except percentages impairment of purchased intangibles as a percentage of net revenues there was no goodwill or purchased intangibles impairment for fiscal during the second quarters of fiscal and and during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we identified possible impairments of goodwill and certain purchased technologies relating to previous acquisitions 
the impairments were based on a change in the long term strategic plan for these purchased technologies following a deterioration in the business climate and changes in sales and cash flow forecasts 
in anticipation of continued customer spending and as part of our strategic plans  we acquired businesses to complement and extend our product offerings 
since these acquisitions were made  many companies in the high technology and software industries had experienced significant decreases in capital funding and customer spending and  as a result  had curtailed research and development activities 
therefore  revenues associated with these businesses did not meet the original expectations at the time of acquisition 

table of contents accordingly  we compared the undiscounted cash flows associated with such acquired business and long lived assets with the respective carrying amounts and determined that an impairment of certain of these assets existed 
as a result  we recorded aggregate impairment charges of million and million of purchased technologies during fiscal and  respectively 
the impaired amount was measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded the present value of the estimated future cash flows as follows impairment expense for years ended january  acquired entity in thousands eonic systems  nv telenetworks berkeley software design  inc the impairment review of these assets was determined based upon the estimated discounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the goodwill and purchased intangibles  using discount rates ranging from to for fiscal no discount rate was applied in fiscal due to the short term nature of remaining cash flows 
the assumptions supporting the cash flows  including the discount rates  were determined using our best estimate as of the date of the impairment review 
the impairment charge for those assets held for disposal also included the expected proceeds of disposition 
as of january  and  we had net book values of goodwill of million and million  respectively  and net book values of purchased intangibles of million and million  respectively 
all identifiable intangible assets  other than goodwill  will continue to be amortized in accordance with sfas no 
see note  goodwill and purchased intangibles in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and other charges 
restructuring and other charges consist of costs associated with restructuring programs  a settlement with our former chief executive officer and a settlement of litigation and related remediation efforts 
restructuring charges 
we recorded net restructuring charges of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  which in each case were classified as operating expenses 
as a result of decisions undertaken by us regarding the cost structure of our business  beginning in fiscal  we implemented restructuring plans that were designed to align our anticipated revenues more closely with our cost structure 
our restructuring plans have been based on certain assumptions regarding the cost structure of our business and the nature and severity of prior industry adjustments and general economic trends  and involved the implementation of a number of initiatives  including headcount reductions  facilities closures  and other cost control measures such as employing a program of office closure days and reducing discretionary spending on items such as consulting and travel 
as a result of the headcount reductions  we eliminated an aggregate of employee positions in fiscal  employee positions in fiscal and employee positions in fiscal our restructuring program for fiscal was initiated prior to our adoption of sfas no

our accounts receivable grew by million during fiscal consistent with our revenue growth 
additionally  during fiscal  accrued compensation increased million primarily due to increased bonuses and commissions 
finally  our deferred revenues increased by million relating primarily to the continued customer adoption of our wind river platforms sold under the enterprise license model

if any of these events of default occurs  either the trustee or the holders of at least of the outstanding notes may declare the principal amount of the notes to be due and payable 
in addition  an event of bankruptcy  insolvency or reorganization involving us or any of our significant subsidiaries will constitute an event of default under the indenture and  in that case  the principal amount of the notes will automatically become due and payable 

table of contents in the event of a change in control  the bondholders may require us to purchase our notes at of the principal amount  plus accrued interest  this purchase could be completed in cash  our common stock or common stock of the parent corporation of the acquiring corporation  if publicly traded  or a combination thereof 
commitments in september and november  we entered into two operating leases for our headquarters facility constructed on land owned by us in alameda  california 
after consideration of various financing alternatives for the construction of our headquarters buildings  the related economic impact of each alternative and the ability to retain control of the property  we chose a form of financing that we believed offered beneficial economic terms  commonly referred to as a synthetic lease 
these leases were treated as operating leases for accounting purposes and financing leases for tax purposes 
a synthetic lease is a form of off balance sheet financing under which an unrelated third party funds of the costs for the acquisition and or construction of the property and leases the asset back to the company  as lessee 
none of our officers or employees had any financial interest in these synthetic lease arrangements 
in january  we notified the lessor of our intent to exercise the purchase options under the synthetic leases 
in april  we completed the transactions  terminated the synthetic leases and purchased the buildings for million 
accordingly  the buildings were recorded as property and equipment on our balance sheet and are being depreciated over their estimated useful lives of years 
additionally  restricted investments of million held under the leases were released 
in april  in connection with the termination of the synthetic leases  we entered into a loan facility with a financial institution in the aggregate principal amount of million  consisting of a non revolving loan commitment of million and a term loan of million  of which million was borrowed during fiscal year during fiscal year  we repaid all outstanding borrowings under the loan facility  releasing million held in restricted investments in connection with the loan facility 
of the original facility  million is still available through october see note  convertible subordinated notes and other borrowings in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the loan facility 
the facility agreement contains customary events of defaults  including payment defaults  breaches of representations and warranties  covenant defaults  certain events of bankruptcy  insolvency and change of control  material judgments  and a cross default to other material agreements and debt where we have incurred any liability in excess of million 
if an event of default occurs  and we do not or cannot cure the default within the time periods specified in the facility agreement  the lender would be entitled to terminate the facility and declare the outstanding amounts under the loan facility to be immediately due and payable

see convertible subordinated notes above 
inclusive of the million of our convertible subordinated notes that we repurchased in march inclusive of minimum future sublease income to be received under noncancelable subleases of approximately  in fiscal  we implemented the first phase of the next version of our enterprise resource planning system 
in connection with the implementation  we incurred an aggregate of million of external costs in fiscal of these costs  million were capitalized during fiscal in addition   remains outstanding at january   and will be paid in fiscal our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including our research and development expenditures  expenses related to selling  general and administrative operations and working capital to support business growth 
we anticipate that our operating and capital expenditures will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
as a result  our net cash flows will depend heavily on i the level of our future sales which depend  to a large extent  on general economic conditions affecting us and our customers  as well as the timing of new product introductions and other competitive factors and ii our ability to implement our restructuring plans and to control expenses 
although it is difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will satisfy our cash requirements for working capital  product development and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months and on a longer term basis 
during or after this period  if cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain an additional credit facility 
our ability to obtain additional financing may be limited by the amount of indebtedness we have outstanding and or our recent performance and financial condition  particularly if our bond rating is lowered or withdrawn  as well as general market conditions if the continuing economic downturn were to continue or become more serious 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us or  if available  that such financing will be available on favorable terms 
if we were unable to obtain financing  we might be required to reduce our expenses  including product development and engineering expenses  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements as of january   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k promulgated by the securities and exchange commission the sec 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r  that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the 
table of contents fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expenses 
the statement requires companies to assess the most appropriate model to calculate the value of the options 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to value options and are currently assessing which model we may use in the future under the statement and may deem an alternative model to be the most appropriate 
the use of a different model to value options may result in a different fair value than the use of the black scholes option pricing model 
in addition  there are a number of other requirements under the new standard that will result in differing accounting treatment than currently required 
these differences include  but are not limited to  the accounting for the tax benefit on employee stock options and for stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
in addition to the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  we will also be required to determine the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the allowed transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas no 
r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
the effective date of the new standard for our consolidated financial statements is our first quarter of fiscal upon adoption  this statement will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements  specifically our statement of operations and earnings per share on a quarterly and annual basis  as we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock option grants and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan rather than disclose the impact on our consolidated net income within our footnotes as is our current practice see note in notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein 
the amounts disclosed within our footnotes are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that will be expensed upon the adoption of sfas no 
r 
compensation expense calculated under sfas no 
r may differ materially from amounts currently disclosed within our footnotes based on changes in the fair value of our common stock  changes in the number of options granted or the terms of such options  the treatment of tax benefits and changes in interest rates or other factors 
in addition  upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we may choose to use a different valuation model to value the compensation expense associated with our employee stock options 
in march  the eitf reached a consensus on the remaining portions of eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  eitf effective for the first reporting period beginning after june  eitf provides new disclosure requirements for other than temporary impairments on debt and equity investments 
companies are required to disclose quantitative information about i the aggregate amount of unrealized losses  and ii the aggregate related fair values of investments with unrealized losses  segregated into time periods during which the investment has been in an unrealized loss position of less than months and greater than months 
in addition  investors are required to disclose the qualitative information that supports their conclusion that the impairments noted in the qualitative disclosure are not other than temporary 
in september  the fasb approved fasb staff position eitf  which defers the effective date for recognition and measurement guidance contained in eitf until certain issues are resolved 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf  however the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods ending after june  we will evaluate the additional provisions of this eitf upon its finalization 

table of contents factors that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock our business faces significant risks 
the risks described below may not be the only risks we face 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations or have a negative impact on our stock price 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could suffer  and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
we may not continue to increase adoption of our enterprise license model 
an increasing proportion of our products are licensed under an enterprise license model that is based upon subscription licenses rather than our traditional perpetual licenses 
there is a risk that we will not be able to continue or increase our rate of adoption by new or transitioning customers to our subscription based model  that customers may not accept the new products we offer under our enterprise license model or that they may reject the terms of the model itself 
in addition  although enterprise licenses represent a potential source of renewable license revenue  there is also a risk that new and transitioned customers will not renew their licenses at the end of the term 
there is a further risk that we may remain dependent upon large end of quarter transactions  that the more complex and time consuming negotiations for enterprise licenses may affect our ability to close such transactions  that customers who purchase enterprise licenses may spend less in the aggregate over the term of the enterprise license than if they had been required to purchase perpetual licenses  and that because our enterprise license model includes limited services  customers may purchase fewer stand alone services from us  which could negatively impact our services revenue 
in any such event  our future revenue and earnings could be below our expectations 
our enterprise license model has impacted the timing of our reported revenues 
the adoption of a subscription based license model has impacted the timing of our reported revenues 
under the enterprise license model revenues are recognized ratably over the subscription period 
by contrast  our traditional perpetual license requires a majority of license revenues to be recognized in the quarter in which the products are delivered and a much smaller amount relating to the fair value of the maintenance being deferred and recognized subsequently over the maintenance period 
therefore  an order for a subscription based license will result in lower current quarter revenue than an equal sized order for a perpetual license 
as a result  our reported revenues have been affected by the adoption of the enterprise license model for our subscription based products 
the impact on near term and deferred revenues will continue to depend on the rate at which customer s adoption or transition from our perpetual model to our enterprise license model 
in addition  an increase in the number of subscription license renewals on multi year terms may result in larger deferred revenues 
to the extent that the adoption rate is higher than we expect  we may experience a greater decline in near term revenues  as well as an increase in deferred revenues 
if we do not successfully manage the shift in our revenues to our enterprise license model  we may not be able to manage our expenses  many of which are fixed in nature  which could have an adverse effect on our profitability 
because a significant portion of our revenues continues to be derived from production licenses  we are dependent upon the ability of our customers to develop and penetrate new markets successfully 
our production license revenues depend both upon our ability to successfully negotiate production license agreements with our customers and  in turn  upon our customers successful commercialization of their underlying products 
in particular  we derive significant revenues from customers that develop products in highly competitive and technologically complex markets such as the internet infrastructure  server and storage  digital consumer  aerospace and defense  industrial control and automotive markets 
if these customers sell fewer products or otherwise face significant economic difficulties  our revenues will decline 
for example  our revenues from production licenses increased  during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  which we 
table of contents believe is primarily due to our customers response to the current market conditions in the high technology sector 
we cannot control our customers product development or commercialization or predict their success 
in addition  we depend on our customers to accurately report the use of their products in order for us to collect our revenues from production licenses 
if our customers are not successful with their products or do not accurately report use of their products to us  our production license revenues may decline significantly 
we have adopted an open source strategy that may not be successful or may expose us to additional risks 
we have adopted a strategy to address the open source market  and we recently released the first of our development tool products based on open source  and also announced the upcoming release of our platform products based on open source 
we cannot be certain whether this strategy will be successful and it may create additional risks for us 
specifically  we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop the products necessary to satisfy customer demand  or that our customers will adopt our products based on open source 
additionally  even if our products are adopted by our customers  they may not be profitable 
very few open source companies have been profitable and we may not be able to generate profits on our linux based offerings 
moreover  it is possible that these efforts to coexist with the open source movement could result in a decline in sales of our proprietary software either as a result of a diversion of internal resources or customer preference 
additionally  customers may defer orders in anticipation of our new products 
if any of these events were to occur  our revenues and earnings could be adversely affected 
as our products that include open source components are adopted  we face increased legal risks  which could affect our ability to develop or sell our open source products 
our open source strategy may make us increasingly vulnerable to claims that our products infringe third party intellectual property rights  in particular because many of the open source components we may incorporate with our products are developed by numerous independent parties over whom we exercise no supervision or control 
third parties may  in particular  assert claims for infringement or claims based on trade secret theories 
our risk is further exacerbated by our lack of access to unpublished software patent applications 
defending claims of infringement  even claims without significant merit  can be expensive 
an adverse legal decision affecting our intellectual property could materially harm our business 
it is also possible that our own intellectual property rights in derivative works we develop under the gnu general public license gpl that applies to linux  or other open source license  may be infringed and that as a result we may need to bring our own claim against third parties 
in addition  the enforceability of the gpl and other open source licenses affect the success of our open source strategy 
the gpl states that any program licensed under it may be liberally copied  modified and distributed 
the gpl is a subject of litigation in the case of the sco group  inc v 
international business machines corp  pending in the united states district court for the district of utah 
it is possible that this court would hold the gnu license to be unenforceable in that litigation  that the gnu license or other open source license could be found to be unenforceable in a separate legal challenge  or that someone could assert a claim for proprietary rights in a program developed and distributed under them 
if an open source license that applies to the licensing of components of our open source products is found to be partially or completely unenforceable  or if there are claims of infringement  we could be required to obtain licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products  reengineer our products  or discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis 
an adverse legal decision affecting our intellectual property could materially harm our business 
uncertainty regarding the legal risks related to open source components could affect sales of our open source products generally 
finally  as result of legal concerns about open source  we may be forced by our customers to adopt additional indemnification or otherwise protect them from potential threats by third parties 
in any such event  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

table of contents the financial accounting standards board s adoption of statement r will cause  and changes to existing accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices may cause  adverse revenue fluctuations  affect our reported results of operations or how we conduct our business 
in december  the fasb adopted statement r  share based payment  which will require us  starting in the first quarter of fiscal year  to measure compensation costs for all stock based compensation including our stock options and employee stock purchase plan  as currently constructed at fair value and record a compensation charge equal to that value 
also  a change in accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
other new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements or taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future 
this change to existing rules  future changes  if any  or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
we expect the adoption of sfas no 
r to have a material adverse impact on our net income or loss and our net income or loss per share by decreasing our income or increasing our losses by the additional amount of such stock option charges 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the extent of such impact and cannot quantify the amount of such impact at this time 
if we do not continue to address new and rapidly changing markets and increasingly complex technologies successfully and deliver our products on a timely basis  our revenues and operating results will decline 
the dso market is characterized by ongoing technological developments  evolving industry standards and rapid changes in customer requirements and product offerings in the device market 
our success depends upon our ability to adapt and respond to these changes in a timely and cost effective manner 
if we fail to continually update our existing products to keep them current with customer needs or to develop new or enhanced products to take advantage of new technologies  emerging standards and expanding customer requirements  our existing products could become obsolete and our financial performance would suffer 
we have from time to time experienced delays in the commercial release of new technologies  new products and enhancements of existing products 
these delays are commonplace in the software industry due to the complexity and unpredictability of the development work required 
if we fail to commercially release new products on schedule as announced  our financial performance could suffer 
we must effectively market and sell new product offerings to key customers  because once a customer has designed a product with a particular operating system  that customer typically is reluctant to change its supplier due to the significant related costs 
if we cannot adapt or respond in a cost effective and timely manner to new technologies and new customer requirements  or if the new products we develop are not attractive to our customers  sales of our products could decline 
numerous factors may cause our total revenues and operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period 
these fluctuations increase the difficulty of financial planning and forecasting and may result in decreases in our available cash and declines in the market price of our stock 
a number of factors  many of which are outside our control  may cause or contribute to significant fluctuations in our total revenues and operating results 
these fluctuations make financial planning and forecasting more difficult 
in addition  these fluctuations may result in unanticipated decreases in our available cash  which could negatively impact our operations 
as discussed more fully below  these fluctuations also could increase the volatility of our stock price 
factors that may cause or contribute to fluctuations in our operating results and revenues include acceptance by our customers of our wind river platforms  the number and timing of orders we receive  including disproportionately higher receipt and shipment of orders in the last month of the quarter  changes in the length of our products sales cycles  which increase as our customers purchase decisions become more strategic and are made at higher management levels  reductions in the number of engineering projects started by our customers due to their own difficult financial or economic conditions  
table of contents the impact of impairment charges arising from past acquisitions  the success of our customers products from which we derive our production license revenues  the mix of our revenues as between sales of products that have more upfront revenue  subscriptions that have more deferred revenues and services which have lower profit margins  our ability to control our operating expenses  and fully realize the impact of the restructuring plans we have implemented  our ability to continue to develop  introduce and ship competitive new products and product enhancements quickly  possible deferrals of orders by customers in anticipation of new product introductions  announcements  product introductions and price reductions by our competitors  our ability to manage costs for fixed price consulting agreements  seasonal product purchases by our customers  which historically have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter  the impact of  and our ability to react to  natural disasters and or events of terrorism  the impact of  and our ability to react to business disruptions arising from or relating to internet or computer viruses service interruptions  changes in business cycles that affect the markets in which we sell our products and services  economic  political and other conditions in the united states and internationally  foreign currency exchange rates  and the impact of any stock based compensation charges arising from the issuance of stock options  stock appreciation rights or any other stock based awards 
one or more of the foregoing factors may cause our operating expenses to be disproportionately high or may cause our net revenues and operating results to fluctuate significantly 
results from prior periods are thus not necessarily indicative of the results of future periods 
we face intense competition in the device software industry  which could decrease demand for our products or cause us to reduce our prices 
the dso industry is characterized by rapid change  new and complex technology and intense competition 
our ability to maintain our current market share depends upon our ability to satisfy customer requirements  enhance existing products and develop and introduce new products 
due to the complexity of the markets in which we operate  where our customers often develop device systems in house  it is difficult to assess the impact of competition on our business and our related share of the markets that we operate in 
we have faced increasing competition in recent years as customers have decreased research and development budgets  sought to increase the value they receive from vendors  including us  attempted to leverage a more competitive bidding process when spending research and development budgets and or deferred or canceled projects  in whole or in part 
as a result  we believe that some customers have elected not to purchase our products and have chosen to undertake such development in house  selected solutions they perceive to be less expensive or relied upon existing licenses from us rather than making new purchases 
we expect the intensity of competition to increase in the future 
increased competitiveness may result in reductions in the prices of our products  run time royalties and services  lower than expected gross margins or loss of market share  any of which would harm our business 
our primary competition comes from internal research and development departments of companies that develop device systems in house 
in many cases  companies that develop device systems in house have already made significant investments of time and effort in developing their own internal systems  making acceptance of 
table of contents our products as a replacement more difficult 
additionally  many of these in house departments may increasingly choose to use open source software  such as the linux operating system 
we also compete with independent software vendors and  to a limited extent  with open source vendors 
some of the companies that develop device systems in house and some of these independent software vendors  such as microsoft corporation  may have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  sales and other resources and significantly greater name recognition than we do 
demands for rapid change and the increasing complexity of the technology in our industry intensify the competition we face 
in addition  our competitors may consolidate or establish strategic alliances to expand product offerings and resources or address new market segments 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products 
these factors favor larger competitors that have the resources to develop new technologies or to respond more quickly with new product offerings or product enhancements 
we may be unable to meet the pace of rapid development set by our competitors or may incur additional costs attempting to do so  which may cause declines in our operating results 
our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately than we do and could in the future develop new technologies that compete with our products or even render our products obsolete  any of which could adversely affect our competitive position 
if our strategic relationships are not successful  our product offerings  distribution and or revenues may be adversely impacted 
we have many strategic relationships with semiconductor companies and customers 
these strategic relationships are complex because some of the companies that are our strategic partners in certain business areas are also our competitors in other business areas 
our strategic partners may also have concurrent relationships with companies that provide open source and in house solutions  which may put pressure on our product development roadmaps  timelines and prices 
if we are not successful in developing and maintaining these strategic relationships  our business may be harmed 
if our collaborative marketing and distribution agreements terminate or expire  the scope of our product offerings may be restricted  and the distribution of our products and revenues may be adversely impacted 
the costs of software development can be high  and we may not realize revenues from our development efforts for a substantial period of time 
introducing new products that rapidly address changing market demands requires a continued high level of investment in research and development 
our product development and engineering expenses  which are net of funded research and development and capitalized research and development  were million  or of total revenues  for fiscal compared to million  or of total revenues  for fiscal if we are required to undertake extensive capital outlays to address changes in the device software optimization market  we may be unable to realize revenue as soon as we may expect 
the costs associated with software development are increasing  including the costs of acquiring or licensing new technologies 
our investment in new and existing market opportunities prior to our ability to generate revenue from these new opportunities may adversely affect our operating results 
our significant international business activities subject us to increased costs and economic risks 
we develop and sell a substantial percentage of our products internationally 
for fiscal  revenues from international sales were million  or of total revenues  as compared to million  or  of total revenue for fiscal additionally  we have investments in  or have made acquisitions of  companies located outside the united states 
over the long term  we expect to continue to make investments to further support and expand our international operations and increase our direct sales force and distribution network in emea  japan and asia pacific 
risks inherent in international operations include the imposition of governmental controls and regulatory requirements  the costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  
table of contents differences in business cultures and sales cycles  differences in operation and sales support expenses  unexpected changes in tariffs  import and export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  restrictions on repatriation of earnings  exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiaries and branch operations  the costs and risks of operating in countries experiencing geopolitical conflict and or terrorism  the effect of our adoption of global pricing models  difficulties in integrating products and operations from foreign acquisitions  the impact of local health and political crises that prohibit or severely limit travel or other interaction with a local economic market  exposure to local economic slowdowns  and the need to guarantee credit instruments extended to support foreign operations 
any of these events  regionally and as a whole  could reduce our international sales and increase our costs of doing business internationally and have a material adverse effect on our gross margins and net operating results 
the rights we rely upon to protect the intellectual property underlying our products may not be adequate  which could enable third parties to use our technology and reduce our ability to compete 
our success depends significantly upon the proprietary technology contained in our products 
we currently rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in our technology and products 
we cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our intellectual property will adequately protect our rights  that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology  or that we can maintain our technology as trade secrets 
in addition  discovery and investigation of unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult 
we expect software piracy  which is difficult to detect  to be a persistent problem  particularly in those foreign countries where the laws may not protect our intellectual property as fully as in the united states 
employees  consultants  and others who participate in the development of our products may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property 
we might not have adequate remedies for infringement or breach of our proprietary rights by third parties  employees or consultants 
further  we have in the past initiated  and in the future may initiate  claims or litigation against third parties for infringement or breach of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
whether or not such litigation is determined in our favor  such actions could result in significant expense to us  divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel from productive tasks or cause product shipment delays 
patent  trademark or copyright infringement or product liability claims against us may result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to expend significant resources 
in addition  patent or copyright claims may require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
we occasionally receive communications from third parties alleging patent  trademark or copyright infringement or other intellectual property claims  and there is always the chance that third parties may assert infringement claims against us or against our customers under circumstances that might require us to provide indemnification 
adoption of our open source strategy increases this risk 
additionally  because our products are increasingly used in applications  such as network infrastructure  transportation  medical and mission critical business systems  in which the failure of the device system could cause property damage  personal injury or economic loss  we may face product liability claims 

table of contents although our agreements with our customers typically contain provisions intended to limit our exposure to infringement and liability claims  these provisions may not be effective in doing so in all circumstances or in all jurisdictions 
any of these types of claims  with or without merit  could result in claims for indemnification by us or costly litigation  could require us to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or remedy product defects  cause product shipment delays or require us to pay significant damages if the claims are successful 
in the case of infringement of another party s intellectual property  we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  however  we cannot be certain that the necessary licenses will be available or that they can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
if we are not successful in defending these claims or  with respect to infringement claims  were to fail to obtain royalty or licensing agreements in a timely manner and on reasonable terms  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
our restructuring plans may not enable us to achieve profitability in a difficult economic environment or achieve our business objectives 
in each of fiscal   and  we implemented restructuring plans that were designed to align our anticipated revenues more closely with our cost structure 
our restructuring plans were based on certain assumptions regarding the cost structure of our business and the nature and severity of the current industry adjustment and general economic trends 
we cannot be certain that the assumptions underlying the restructuring plans will prove to be accurate 
if they are not  our restructuring plans may not result in the correct alignment of our anticipated revenues and cost structure 
our restructuring plans involved the implementation of a number of initiatives  including headcount reductions  facilities closures  and other cost control measures  that may adversely affect our ability to realize our current or future business objectives 
as a result of the headcount reductions  we eliminated an aggregate of  employee positions since the beginning of fiscal we also recorded net restructuring charges of million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and  respectively 
these measures may adversely affect our ability to realize our current or future business objectives 
in addition  the costs actually incurred in connection with restructuring actions may exceed our estimated costs of these actions 
additional restructuring actions may result in further cash and or non cash charges  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
as a result  we cannot be sure that we will return to long term profitability as a result of our restructuring plans 
we are exposed to potential risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate controls under section of the sarbanes oxley act of we have evaluated our internal controls systems in order to allow management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  our internal controls  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of we have performed the system and process evaluation and testing required in an effort to comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements of section as a result  we have incurred significant additional expenses and a diversion of management s time 
if we are not able to continue to meet the requirements of section in a timely manner or with adequate compliance  we might be required to disclose material weaknesses if they develop or are uncovered and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  such as the sec or the nasdaq national market 
any such action could harm our business 
our management  including our ceo and cfo  does not  however  expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
our disclosure controls or procedures can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

table of contents our common stock price is subject to volatility 
in recent years  the stock markets in general and the shares of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations 
these recent price fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies affected 
our stock price has similarly experienced significant volatility 
as reported on the nasdaq national market  during fiscal our stock had a high sales price of and a low sales price of and  during fiscal  our stock had a high sales price of and a low sales price of 
in some of our past fiscal quarters  we experienced shortfalls in revenue and earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and investors  which have had an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
these factors relating to the fluctuations in our revenues and operating results may continue to affect our stock price 
comments by or changes in estimates from securities analysts as well as significant developments involving our competitors or our industry could also affect our stock price 
in addition  the market price of our common stock is affected by the stock performance of other technology companies generally  as well as companies in our industry and our customers in particular 
other broad market and industry factors may negatively affect our operating results or cause our stock price to decline  as may general political or economic conditions in the united states and globally  such as recessions  or interest rate or currency fluctuations 
in particular  the stock market may be adversely impacted  or experience unusual volatility  as a result of the outbreak of armed conflict or hostilities involving the united states or incidences of terrorism in  or directed at  the united states or its allies 
we have substantial financial commitments  which could make it difficult for us to obtain financing and deplete our cash reserves 
additionally  these commitments could be accelerated in certain circumstances  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
as of january   we had million in outstanding indebtedness under our convertible subordinated notes 
as of january   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and investments with maturities of greater than one year of million 
the indenture under which our convertible subordinates notes were issued contains customary events of default  and also provides that an event of default occurs if we or one of our significant subsidiaries fail to pay  at final maturity or upon acceleration  any indebtedness for money borrowed in an outstanding principal amount in excess of million  and the indebtedness is not discharged  or the default is not cured  waived or rescinded within days after written notice is provided in accordance with the terms of the indenture 
under the terms of our convertible subordinated notes  if an event of default were to occur for any of the aforementioned reasons or other reasons and we do not or cannot cure the event of default within specified periods  the lenders could in each case accelerate payment of the indebtedness 
in march  we repurchased a further million of our convertible subordinated debt 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and debt obligations 
we have an investment policy that has been approved by our board of directors 
we place our investments with high quality credit issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our investment policy  our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss 
consequently  we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to be low risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 

table of contents we believe an immediate basis point move in interest rates affecting our floating and fixed rate financial instruments as of january  would have an immaterial effect on our pretax earnings 
we also believe an immediate basis point move in interest rates would have an immaterial effect on the fair value of our fixed income securities 
wind river s investment portfolio consists of various marketable debt securities 
the longer the duration of these securities  the more susceptible these securities are to general changes in market interest rates 
as general market interest rates increase  those securities purchased with a lower yield at cost will likely show a mark to market unrealized loss 
all unrealized losses are due to changes in general market interest rates and bond yields 
wind river expects to realize the full value of all these investments upon their maturity 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exposures related to certain non functional currency related inter company and other balances 
additionally  we may adjust our foreign currency hedging position by taking out additional contracts or by terminating or offsetting existing forward contracts 
these adjustments may result from changes in the underlying non functional currency exposures or from fundamental shifts in the economics of particular exchange rates 
gains and losses on terminated forward contracts  or on contracts that are offset  are recognized in income in the period of contract termination or offset 
our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature 
as of january   we had outstanding contracts with the following terms buy sell sell buy sell buy buy currency gbp euro jpy cad cad sek kr amount rate usd equivalent maturity date contract amounts are representative of the expected amounts to be paid under the terms of these instruments 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
as of january   the fair value of the above contracts was not significant 
equity price risk we value our marketable equity investments using the closing price of the stock at the end of each month 
as a result  we reflect these investments on our balance sheet as of january  at their aggregate market value of approximately  we recorded an impairment charge on these marketable equity investments of  in fiscal representing the amount determined to be an other than temporary decline as of the date of impairment 
as of january   we own  shares of common stock of e sim ltd 
e sim that was purchased prior to e sim s public offering in july at per share  with a current carrying value of per share 
on january   the closing price of e sim s stock was per share 
we own  shares of common stock of tvia  inc tvia that was purchased prior to tvia s public offering in august at per share with a current carrying value of per share 
on january   the closing price of tvia s stock was per share 
we own  shares of common stock of insignia solutions  ltd 
insignia purchased in february at a carrying value of per share  with a current carrying value of per share 
on january   the closing price of insignia was per share 
we also have certain other minority investments in private companies  which have no book value as of january  and these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and might never develop 
we recorded an impairment loss of million during fiscal related to these investments
