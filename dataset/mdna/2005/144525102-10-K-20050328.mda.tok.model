the company does not believe that changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets in which the company distributes its products would have a significant effect on operating results 
if sales to foreign markets increase in future periods  the effects could become significant 
changes in short term interest rates on debt balances with variable interest rates could have an affect on the company s earnings
