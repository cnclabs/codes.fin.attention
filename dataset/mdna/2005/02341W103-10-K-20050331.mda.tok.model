item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global  specialty minerals company and earn our revenues and profits from seven product lines 
our minerals segment operates manufacturing facilities in north america  europe  and asia pacific regions and has three business units metalcasting  pet products and specialty minerals 
our environmental segment operates seven manufacturing facilities in six countries and has three business units lining technologies  building materials and water treatment 
additionally  we have a transportation segment that performs trucking services for the minerals and environmental segments as well as unrelated parties 
we are also developing a nanocomposite business that is reported within our corporate segment 
the principal mineral that we utilize to generate revenues is bentonite 
we own or lease bentonite reserves in the united states and china 
additionally  through our joint ventures and minority interests  we have access to bentonite reserves in egypt  india and mexico 
bentonite deposits have varying physical properties which require us to characterize which markets our reserves can serve 
we believe that our understanding of bentonite properties  mining methods  processing and application to markets are the core components of the longevity of our company and our future prospects 
our customer base is diverse in regard to their end markets and geography 
they range from foundries that produce castings for automotive and transportation products heavy duty trucks and railroad cars to producers of consumer goods cat box filler  cosmetics and detergents 
a significant portion of our products have been used in the same applications for decades and have experienced minimal technological obsolescence 
a majority of our business is performed under short term agreements  therefore  terms of sale  such as pricing and volume  can change within our fiscal year 
approximately of our revenue is generated in north america  consequently  the state of the us economy impacts our revenues 
our fastest growing markets are in central europe and asia  which have continued to outpace the us in economic growth 
the weakening of the us dollar has been a benefit to our revenues and profits over the past year  however  our operating results may be affected in the future by changes in the euro  british pound  and polish zloty compared to the us dollar 
sustainable  long term profit growth is our primary objective 
we are undertaking a number of strategic initiatives to achieve this goal 
organic growth the central component of our growth strategy is expansion of our product lines and market presence 
we have had a history of commitment to research and development and using this resource to bring innovative products to market 
we believe this approach to growth offers the best probability of achieving our long term goals at the lowest risk 

globalization we have expanded our manufacturing and marketing organizations into europe and asia pacific over the last years 
this operating experience enables us to expand further into emerging markets 
we see china and india as significant opportunities for expanding our revenues and earnings over the long term as a number of markets we serve  such as metalcasting and lining technologies  are expected to grow 

mineral development bentonite is a component in over of the products we produce 
since it is a natural material  we must continually expand our reserve base to maintain a long term business 
our goal is to add new reserves to replace the bentonite mined each year 
furthermore  we need to assure new reserves meet the physical property requirements for our diverse product lines and are economical to mine 
our organization that is committed to developing its global reserve base to meet these requirements 

acquisitions we continually seek opportunities to add complementary businesses to our portfolio of products 
over the last three years  we have acquired seven businesses for a total cost of approximately million 
a strong financial position will enable us to continue to acquire businesses which  in our assessment  are valued fairly and fit with our growth strategy 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of the strategic initiatives described above 
a number of risks will challenge us in meeting our long term objectives 
we describe certain risks  such as competition and our reliance on economically sensitive markets  under item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
in general  the significance of these risks has not changed over the past year 
one particular situation  however  does present a challenge to manage in the near term 
transportation costs continue to increase significantly 
domestically  inland rail and trucking costs continue to increase 
in addition  bulk cargo shipping costs continue to increase due to acute demand from china 
we rely on shipping bulk cargos of bentonite from the us and china to customers  as well as our own subsidiaries 
this issue is not isolated to amcol  however  we may need to offset additional shipping costs with price increases to customers in order to maintain our profitability 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving these price increases 
we are also reviewing our shipping patterns to determine more cost effective means of transporting bulk cargos 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations describes relevant aspects of our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to select accounting policies that are appropriate for our business  and to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain in applying those policies 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate these estimates  judgments and assumptions for reasonableness because of the critical impact that these factors have on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our management has identified the most critical accounting policies upon which the financial statements are based and that involve the most complex and subjective decisions and assessments 
these policies are discussed below and also in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these policies with the members of the audit committee of our board of directors 
these accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the discussion which follows should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
valuation of accounts receivable we provide credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and perform ongoing credit evaluations 
our customer base is diverse and includes customers located throughout the world 
payment terms in certain of the foreign countries in which we do business are longer than those that are customary in the united states  and as a result  may give rise to additional credit risk related to outstanding accounts receivable from these non us customers 
likewise  a change in the financial position  liquidity or prospects of any of our customers could have an impact on our ability to collect amounts due 
while concentrations of credit risk related to trade receivables are somewhat limited by our large customer base  we do extend significant credit to some of our customers 
we make estimates of the amounts of our gross accounts receivable that will not be collectible  and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying value of accounts receivable to the amount that is expected to be realized 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established based upon the company s historical bad debt experience  a review of the overall aging of the accounts  and an analysis of specific customer accounts  particularly those with past due balances 
the recorded allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to cover specific customer collection issues identified by management at the balance sheet date  and to provide for potential losses from other accounts based on our historical experience 
increases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are recorded as an expense and included in general  selling and administrative expenses in the period identified 
our estimate of the required allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change from period to period 
in addition  it requires management to make judgments about the future collectibility of customer accounts 
inventory valuation inventories are recorded at the lower of actual manufactured or purchased cost  or estimated net realizable value 
in order to determine net realizable value  management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and evaluates significant items to determine whether they are excess or obsolete 
we record the value of estimated excess or obsolete inventory as a reduction of inventory and as an expense which is included in cost of sales in the period it is identified 
our estimate of excess and obsolete inventory is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change from period to period 
in addition  it requires management to make judgments about the future demand for inventory 
in order to quantify excess or obsolete inventory  management prepares lists of inventory quantities on hand and determines the amount of such inventories that  based on projected demand  are not anticipated to be sold within the next to months or  based on our current product offerings  are excess or obsolete 
this list is then reviewed with sales and production management personnel to determine whether this list of potential excess or obsolete inventory is complete 
factors which impact this evaluation include  for example  whether there has been a change in the market or packaging for particular products  and whether there are components of inventory that incorporate obsolete formulations or technology 
in certain businesses in which we are engaged  such as the domestic cat litter business  product and packaging changes can occur rapidly and expose us to excess and obsolete inventories 
goodwill and long lived assets we have made substantial investments in property  plant and equipment and have a moderate investment in goodwill 
for property  plant and equipment  we evaluate the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
for goodwill  we perform an annual impairment assessment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in analyzing the fair value of goodwill and assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  management uses models which are based on estimates of future operating performance and related cash flows 
in preparing these models  management must make estimates in projecting future cash flows attributable to the reporting unit or assets being tested  in selecting a discount rate that reflects the related business risks  and in determining the appropriate perpetuity or disposal value 
in developing these projections of future cash flows  we make a variety of important assumptions and estimates that have a significant impact on management s assessments of whether the carrying values of goodwill and property  plant and equipment should be adjusted to reflect impairment 
among these are assumptions and estimates about the future growth and profitability of the related business unit or asset  and assumptions about anticipated future economic  regulatory and political conditions in the relevant market 
our estimates related to the carrying values of goodwill and property  plant and equipment are considered to be critical accounting estimates because they are susceptible to change from period to period based on our judgments about a variety of factors 
for example  judgment is required to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  in performing assessments of the carrying values of these assets  we must make judgments about the future business  economic  regulatory  and political conditions affecting these assets  as well as to select the appropriate risk related rates for discounting estimated future cash flows  and to develop reasonable estimates of disposal values 
retirement benefits we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for substantially all of our domestic employees hired on or before december  in order to measure the expense and obligations associated with these retirement benefits  management must make a variety of estimates including discount rates used to value certain liabilities  expected return on plan assets set aside to fund these liabilities  rate of compensation increase  employee turnover rates  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
our benefit plan committee determines the key assumptions related to the discount rate  expected investment rate of return and compensation increases after consulting with the actuarial firm that performs the calculations 
other assumptions are also set based on consultation with our actuaries 
we base our estimates on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances 
the discount rate reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income debt instruments on the measurement date 
the rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date 
an increase in the discount rate reduces pension expense and liabilities 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is determined using historic market return trends together with current market conditions and actual plan experience 
an increase in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets reduces pension expense and liabilities 
the expected rate of compensation increase is determined based on our near term outlook and assumed inflation 
higher compensation rates increase the pension expense and liabilities 
retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
mortality rates are based on tables published by the insurance industry 
different estimates used by management could result in our recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time 
note to notes to consolidated financial statements describes details of our pension obligations and the expense for the year ended december  income taxes our effective tax rate is based on the expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe those positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not succeed 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of changes to reserves that we consider appropriate 
the rate is then applied to pre tax income reported in our consolidated statements of operations 
our estimates of income tax items  expense and reserves are considered to be critical accounting estimates because they are susceptible to change from period to period based on our judgments about a variety of factors 
as of december   our income taxes receivable includes a contingency reserve to reflect the potential reduction of refunds which may result from the examination of the returns by the irs 
valuation allowances are recorded  if necessary  to measure a deferred tax asset at an estimated realizable value 
both positive and negative evidence are considered in forming our judgment as to whether a valuation allowance is appropriate 
changes in a valuation allowance are recorded in the period when we determine events have occurred that will impact the realizable value of the asset 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a reserve or valuation allowance  is audited and finally resolved 
audits of our united states federal income tax returns have been completed through state income tax returns are audited more infrequently 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require use of our cash and could result in the recording of additional tax expense 
favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our tax provision in the year of resolution 
the company has not provided for us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on approximately million of undistributed earnings from international subsidiaries as of december  because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the united states 
if these earnings were distributed  foreign tax credits may become available under current law to reduce or eliminate the resulting us income tax liability 
in october  the american jobs creation act the act was enacted which allowed for a temporary dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated into the us the portion of the dividend that qualifies for the deduction is that amount which exceeds an average of past years foreign dividends 
additionally  certain criteria must be met when the funds are repatriated and may ultimately qualify for an effective tax rate as low as 
the company is in process of evaluating whether it will repatriate foreign earnings under the act 
the range of amounts that are reasonably under consideration for repatriation are from to million 
the company will evaluate the merits of repatriating foreign earnings in and report the tax impact  if any  of an envisioned repatriation upon the finalization of a repatriation plan 
the company has not recognized any income tax effect relating to the act as we are currently not in a position to reasonably estimate the tax impact of any repatriation 
new accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
amends accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
sfas no 
also requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities  it is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company adopted this statement in  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to sfas no 
r  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  to improve financial statement disclosure for defined benefit plans 
this statement requires additional disclosures about the assets including plan assets by category  obligations and cash flows of defined pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
it also requires reporting of various elements of pension and other postretirement benefit costs on a quarterly basis 
generally  the disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after december   however  information about foreign plans is effective for fiscal years ending after june  we adopted the revised sfas no 
in december we grant various types of stock based compensation to directors  executives and employees 
the majority of our stock based compensation is awarded in the form of non qualified stock options and restricted stock 
effective january   we prospectively adopted the fair value method of recording stock based compensation as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
as a result  in we began to expense the fair value of stock options that were awarded to employees after january  prior to  we accounted for stock options using the intrinsic method in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this method  no compensation expense was recognized for stock options awarded prior to the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which allowed us to adopt sfas no 
prospectively  provide that the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share be presented as if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards granted to employees  not just awards granted after the date of adoption 
since we chose the prospective method of expensing stock options  the actual stock based compensation expense recorded in and was less than the amount calculated for this pro forma requirement 
in december  the fasb amended fas  accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
this statement eliminates the prospective option we have applied under sfas no 
and requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after june  due to the fact that the majority of our options issued prior to january   the date we adopted sfas no 
 will have vested as of june  the revised computations will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
fasb staff position fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp  provides guidance under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of the jobs act on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
the jobs act was enacted on october  the jobs act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate income earned abroad principally for earnings that have previously been deemed permanently reinvested by providing a dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
we have previously deemed our foreign earnings as permanently reinvested and have not fully provided for taxes on unremitted foreign earnings 
as a result and under the company s current plans  we do not expect that fsp will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
fsp no 
 application of fasb statement no  accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of provides guidance on applying the deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities 
the deduction will be phased in from through the jobs act also provides for a two year phase out of the existing extra territorial income exclusion eti for foreign sales 
the deduction will be treated as a special deduction as described in fasb statement no 
as such  the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date 
rather  the impact of this deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on our tax return 
we do not expect the net effect of the phase out of the eti and the phase in of this new deduction to result in a material change in our effective tax rate for fiscal years and  based on current earnings levels 
results of operations for the three years ended december  the discussion below references the consolidated statement of operations on page f in part iv of this document

net sales improved over in all three business units  metalcasting  pet products and specialty minerals 
metalcasting volumes improved in north america primarily from increased demand from certain foundry customers 
pricing also improved in certain product lines to offset higher raw material and shipping costs 
our asian metalcasting businesses also increased volumes over  particularly in china 
pet products sales increased due to higher volume and improved pricing  which was aided by lower customer discounts 
specialty minerals sales primarily improved due to higher volume to detergent customers 
oil and gas drilling volume also improved over gross profit increased over primarily as a result of the improvement in net sales described above 
in addition  productivity improvements in the pet products business decreased unit manufacturing costs 
higher volume and productivity improvements expanded gross margin by basis points to in the inclusion of a full year of costs related to csm  together with higher compensation and employee benefit costs accounted for a majority of the increase in general  selling and administrative expenses

fluctuations in foreign currency translation accounted for approximately of the increase 
strong volume increases in the european lining technologies and building materials businesses also contributed to the increase

these services are invoiced to the minerals and environmental segments at arms length rates and those costs are subsequently charged to customers 
intersegment sales and costs reported above reflect the elimination of these transactions 
corporate costs include management information systems  human resources  investor relations  corporate communications and finance 
additionally  marketing  research and operating costs related to the development of the nanocomposite business are included in this segment 
segment operating expenses were primarily impacted by increased stock compensation costs and higher professional and consulting fees associated with complying with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
we recorded approximately million of tax consulting fees in in connection with the filing of amended federal income tax returns which are claiming refunds for increased deductions and credits for the through periods 
further background on the amended returns is described below in the income taxes narrative 
nanocomposite expenses declined slightly due lower net manufacturing costs

 accounting for stock based compensation 
we elected to record stock based compensation costs using fair value under the prospective method 
lower nanocomposite development expenses in were due to a decline in research and development costs and lower net manufacturing costs 
net interest expense net interest expense was million  million and million in   and  respectively 
higher average funded debt was the primary cause for the increase in over debt increased due to acquisitions and an increase in working capital 
the change from to was due to lower average funded debt 
other income expense other income in was approximately million 
in and  other income was million and less than million  respectively 
this item reflects a number of miscellaneous transactions including gains and losses related to foreign exchange transactions and disposals of fixed assets 
the decline in from was primarily attributed to lower recognized foreign exchange gains at our uk and poland businesses in the current year 
income taxes the effective income tax rate for was compared with in and in in  the company recorded a reduction to income tax expense of  associated with depletion deductions and research and development credits available in computing income tax expense 
approximately of this amount relates to changes in estimates resulting from the finalization  in  of the tax return for the tax year 
the remaining  relates to the filing of amended federal income tax returns dating from through regarding the  mentioned above  the company recomputed its federal income tax liability for these periods after determining that it could increase certain deductions and credits as allowed under the internal revenue code 
the total refund claimed on the returns was million  however  the company determined that a contingency reserve was necessary to reflect potential reduction of the refund after examination of the returns by the irs 
the company also recorded  in  a million credit to income tax expense for the adjustment of deferred income tax assets and income tax payables at a uk subsidiary 
a portion of this adjustment related to prior reporting periods  but was considered immaterial to those periods  therefore  the entire amount was reflected in if these two adjustments had not been recorded  the effective income tax rate for would have been 
our effective tax rate is also influenced by the mix of earnings amongst various tax jurisdictions and changes in tax deductions that impact our federal income tax return  but are not recorded in our financial statements 
in  the rate was positively impacted due to our use of alternative percentage depletion calculations 
additionally  we incurred lower effective tax rates in foreign jurisdictions 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements  which is included in part iv of this report  provides further detail on the reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the statutory rate 
the decrease in the rate from was due to increased taxable income in foreign jurisdictions which have lower statutory rates than the us discontinued operations discontinued operations reported in reflected the recording of a tax benefit associated with the disposal of the uk based metalcasting and cat litter businesses 
the disposal transactions were completed in on february   the internal revenue service notified us that audits of certain federal income tax returns  including  had been completed and approved by the committee on joint taxation 
the return included deductions for losses associated with the disposal of the aforementioned businesses 
upon receiving this notification  effective as of december   we revised our estimate of income taxes payable previously recorded to recognize an income tax receivable of million  including interest on the forthcoming refund 
the tax refunds were received in net income net income for was million compared with million and million in and  respectively 
in  net income included an million benefit from discontinued operations as previously discussed 
the improvement in income from continuing operations in both comparison periods vs 
and vs 
was attributed to the increase in operating profit for the reasons described earlier in this report 
net income in was also positively impacted by the adjustments to income tax expense which reduced the overall effective tax rate as previously discussed 
earnings per share diluted earnings per share were calculated using the weighted average number of shares of common stock  including common share equivalents  outstanding during the year 
stock options issued to key employees and directors are considered common share equivalents 
the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalent shares outstanding was approximately million in  million in and million in there were million shares outstanding  excluding common share equivalents  at december   compared with million at december   and million at december  the increase in shares in was due to exercise of stock options which was partially offset by stock repurchases 
the million share increase in was related to the issuance of million shares of treasury stock to employees in connection with the exercise of stock options 
this increase was offset by the repurchase of  shares of common stock on the open market 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in were per share compared with per share and per share in and  respectively 
the improvement for both comparison periods was commensurate with the increase in net income from continuing operations previously described 
also impacting  was a reduction of income tax expense  described above  which contributed approximately per share 
net income per diluted share was share in which was positively impacted by per diluted share due to the effect of discontinued operations as previously described 
net income per diluted share was equal to income from continuing operations per share in and liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operations  borrowings from a revolving credit facility and proceeds from the exercise of stock options by employees have been the sources of funds to purchase property  plant and equipment  acquire businesses  repurchase common stock  and pay dividends to shareholders 
we believe cash flows from operations and borrowings from an unused and committed revolving credit facility will be adequate to support our operating plans for the foreseeable future 
following is a discussion and analysis of our cash flow activities as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows within part iv of this report 
during  cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was million compared with million in and million in the decline in was primarily attributed to cash used for working capital 
accounts receivable and inventories in increased by million and million  respectively  over the increases were commensurate with our sales growth 
the decline in from was also due to an increase in working capital 
accounts receivable and inventories increases also accounted for the working capital increase in net cash provided by discontinued operations was million in  which was attributed to the receipt of federal income tax refunds recorded as receivables in december  net cash used in investing activities in was million compared with million in and million in capital expenditures totaled million and acquisitions were million in in and  capital expenditures were million and million  respectively  while acquisitions were million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures increased in over primarily due to an acquisition of a vacant facility in the us for million that is planned for consolidating certain manufacturing operations for our environmental segment 
the remaining portion of the increase was due to further expansion of operations in asia 
there was minimal change in capital expenditures in compared with acquisitions increased in over due to two acquisitions that added to our environmental segment 
we foresee capital expenditures in to be comparable to we continue to seek businesses to acquire that meet our strategic objectives  however  we currently do not anticipate any significant funding requirements for such activities in cash provided by financing activities was million in  while cash used in financing activities was million in and million in net borrowings of debt in were approximately million 
we had net repayments of debt totaling approximately million and net borrowings of approximately million in and  respectively 
the increase in borrowings in was attributed to acquisitions and funding working capital growth 
net debt repayments in were the result of higher cash flow from operations and relatively lower spending on acquisitions

the facility requires certain covenants to be met including specific amounts of net worth  and also limits our ability to make additional borrowings and guarantees 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  operating leases relate to non cancelable obligations for railroad cars  truck trailers  computer software  office equipment  certain automobiles  and office and plant facilities 
additional information regarding operating leases is disclosed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this report 
at december  and  the company had outstanding standby letters of credit of million and million  respectively  which are not included in the obligations in the table above 
these letters of credit typically serve to guarantee the company s performance of its obligations related to land reclamation and workers compensation claims 
the company has recognized the estimated costs of its obligations related to land reclamation and workers compensation claims in the company s consolidated balance sheets as of december  and since the mid s  we and or our subsidiaries have been named as one of a number of defendants in product liability lawsuits relating to the minor free silica content of our bentonite products used in the metalcasting industry 
the plaintiffs in these lawsuits are primarily employees of our foundry customers 
to date  we have not incurred significant costs in defending these matters 
we believe we have adequate insurance coverage and do not believe the litigation will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  liquidity or results of the operations 
forward looking statements and risk factors certain statements we make from time to time  including statements in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation section above  constitute forward looking statements made in reliance upon the safe harbor contained in section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements include statements relating to our company or our operations that are preceded by terms such as expects  believes  anticipates  intends and similar expressions  and statements relating to anticipated growth  levels of capital expenditures  future dividends  expansion into global markets and the development of new products 
such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results  performance or achievements could differ materially from the results  performance or achievements expressed in  or implied by  these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including without limitation the following competition the minerals market is very competitive 
we believe competition is essentially a matter of product quality  price  delivery  service and technical support 
several of our competitors in the us market are larger and have substantially greater financial resources 
if we fail to compete successfully based on these or other factors  we may lose customers or fail to recruit new customers and our business and future financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
reliance on metalcasting and construction industries approximately of our minerals segment s sales and of our environmental segment s sales in were to the metalcasting and construction markets  respectively 
the metalcasting and construction markets depend heavily upon the strength of the domestic and international economies 
if these economies weaken  demand for products by the metalcasting and construction markets may decline and our business or future financial results in the minerals and environmental segments may be adversely affected 
regulatory and legal matters our operations are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the environment and to health and safety matters 
substantial penalties may be imposed if we violate certain of these laws and regulations even if the violation was inadvertent or unintentional 
if these laws or regulations are changed or interpreted differently in the future  it may become more difficult or expensive for us to comply 
in addition  investigations or evaluations of our products by government agencies may require us to adopt additional safety measures or precautions 
if our costs to comply with such laws and regulations in the future materially increase  our business and future financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
we may also be subject to adverse litigation results in addition to increased compliance costs arising from future changes in laws and regulations that may negatively impact our operations and profits 
risks of international expansion an important part of our business strategy is to expand internationally 
we intend to seek acquisitions  joint ventures and strategic alliances globally 
in  our business outside north america represented approximately of our consolidated sales 
the approximate breakdown of the sales outside of the united states for was as follows europe  asia pacific  and other regions 
as we expand internationally  we will be subject to increased risks  which may include the following 
currency exchange or price control laws  
currency translation adjustments  
political and economic instability  
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  
tariffs and other trade barriers  
longer accounts receivable collection cycles  and 
adverse tax consequences 
the above listed events could result in sudden  and potentially prolonged  changes in demand for our products 
also  we may have difficulty enforcing agreements and collecting accounts receivable through a foreign country s legal system 
ocean shipping and logistics bulk cargo shipping costs have been rising significantly due to acute demand from china 
we rely on shipping bulk cargos of bentonite from the us and china to customers  as well as our own subsidiaries 
this issue is not isolated to amcol  however  we may need to offset additional shipping costs with price increases to customers in order to maintain our profitability 
other factors in the us that will potentially impact us are escalating costs of purchased raw materials derived from petrochemical stocks and increases in rail freight rates 
while we have been successful in attaining price increases in certain markets to offset some of these rising costs  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in continuing to achieve these price increases 
volatility of stock price the stock market has been extremely volatile in recent years 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  factors such as the following may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock 
fluctuations in our financial results  
our introduction of new services or products  
announcements of acquisitions  strategic alliances or joint ventures by us  our customers or our competitors  
changes in analysts recommendations regarding our common stock  and 
general economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that the price of our common stock will increase in the future or be maintained at its recent levels 
financial regulation risk in response to recently enacted changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  we continue to devote significant resources and time to comply with these new requirements 
in particular  we are currently undertaking a full analysis and documentation of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
in addition to significant expenditures  compliance with these new rules has also required significant time and attention by our management  which has caused disruptions to normal business operations 
as discussed in item a 
controls and procedures  we have identified a material weakness that relates to financial statement tax provisions 
additional testing could identify additional deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting 
we expect to conclude that the company has at least one material weakness in internal control over financial reporting 
as a result  we will be unable to conclude that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting are effective as of december  we are not certain of the consequences of our inability to conclude that our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting are effective  although possible consequences could include actions by regulatory authorities such as the sec or the new york stock exchange  a loss of confidence by our investors in our reported financial information  and a decline in the trading price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational corporation that manufactures and markets products in countries throughout the world  we are subject to certain market risks  including those related to foreign currency  interest rates and government actions 
we use a variety of practices to manage these market risks  including  when considered appropriate  derivative financial instruments 
we use derivative financial instruments only for risk management and does not use them for trading or speculative purposes 
exchange rate sensitivity we are exposed to potential gains or losses from foreign currency fluctuations affecting net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies 
our primary exposures are to changes in exchange rates for the us dollar versus the euro  the british pound  and the polish zloty 
we also have significant exposure to changes in exchange rates between the british pound and the euro and the polish zloty and the euro 
our various currency exposures often offset each other  providing a natural hedge against currency risk 
periodically  specific foreign currency transactions eg inventory purchases are hedged with forward contracts to reduce the foreign currency risk 
as of december   we had no material outstanding foreign currency contracts 
interest rate sensitivity the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for debt obligations 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
the instruments actual cash flows are denominated in us dollars 
expected maturity date fair thereafter total value us equivalent in thousands short term debt variable rate average interest rate long term debt variable rate    average interest rate total    we periodically use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on debt securities 
these instruments allow us to change the characteristics of variable rate debt into fixed rate or fixed rate debt into variable rate 
interest rate differentials are paid or received on these arrangements over the life of the agreements 
at the end of and  there were no interest rate swaps outstanding 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk on certain assets  primarily accounts receivable 
we provide credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and perform ongoing credit evaluations 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the large number of customers comprising our customer base 
we currently believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover customer credit risks 
our accounts receivable financial instruments are carried at amounts that approximate fair value
