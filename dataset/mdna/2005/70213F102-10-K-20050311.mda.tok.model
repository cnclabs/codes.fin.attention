item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following section presents highlight information from management to assist with understanding the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of partners trust financial group  inc  and its subsidiary combined  the company  during the year ended december  and the preceding two years 
the consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k should be read in conjunction with the discussions in this section 
the matters discussed in this section contain certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of statements made that are not historical facts are forward looking and are based on estimates  forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties referred to above include  but are not limited to those described under forward looking statements above 
highlights and overview the company s results for were most significantly impacted by its second step conversion from a mutual holding company to a stock holding company  and its acquisition of bsb bancorp bsb  a billion bank holding company  on july  in the conversion  we sold  shares of common stock at per share and issued  shares of common stock to former minority shareholders of the company s predecessor mutual holding company at an exchange ratio of shares of company stock for each minority share 
the net proceeds received in the conversion  after direct offering expenses  were million 
the reorganization was accounted for as a change in corporate form with no resulting change in the historical basis of the company s assets  liabilities and equity 
direct offering costs were deducted from the proceeds of the shares sold in the offering 
as a result of the acquisition  bsb was merged into the company  and bsb s wholly owned subsidiary bank  bsb bank trust company  was merged into partners trust bank the bank 
we paid approximately million in cash and issued  shares of company common stock with a market value of million to the former bsb shareholders as consideration for the acquisition 
at the time of the acquisition  bsb had billion in assets  billion in gross loans  and billion in deposits and operated through branches 
the acquisition of bsb created million of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets primarily core deposit intangible of million 
there were no branch closures and the integration of all major systems was performed in july our results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on our loans and securities and our cost of funds  consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan losses  securities and loan sale activities  loan servicing activities  service charges and fees collected on our deposit accounts  income collected from trust and investment advisory services and the income earned on our investment in bank owned life insurance 
our expenses primarily consist of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expense  marketing expense  technology expense  other expense and income tax expense 
in addition  we had significant expenses related to the reorganization from a mutual holding company and the bsb acquisition 
results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and the actions of regulatory authorities 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  general 
total assets were billion at december   which is billion higher than at december  significant increases occurred in most asset categories as a result of the bsb acquisition 
the following table summarizes these changes in thousands change from amount recognized december  as result of to december  bsb acquisition cash and cash equivalents securities loans receivable allowance for loan losses net loans goodwill other intangible assets  net other assets total assets deposits borrowings other liabilities junior subordinated obligations issued to unconsolidated subsidiary trusts shareholders equity total liabilities equity net assets acquired estimated fair value at date of acquisition 
includes mortgagors escrow funds 
the company s loan portfolio totaled billion at december   compared to million at december  this increase was due to the billion of loans acquired in the bsb acquisition  net of paydowns and chargeoffs as we worked to reduce our exposure to certain higher risk loan relationships acquired from bsb 
the proceeds from the loan repayments were reinvested into generally lower yielding securities  which had a negative impact on our net interest margin as more fully discussed later  but we believe the longer term results of the company will be better served by reducing our exposure to higher risk commercial credits 
total deposits increased billion due primarily to the bsb acquisition 
bsb s deposit composition was similar to ours and therefore the acquisition did not have a significant impact on the composition of our deposits 
due to the reduction in our net interest margin  as more fully discussed later  during the first part of we priced our deposit account rates near the lowest in our marketplace  and at levels below most other local community banks 
this deposit pricing strategy made it more difficult for us to attract and or retain deposits and has contributed to the outflow of deposits totaling million after considering the effect of the acquisition 
during the second half of we began to raise our deposit rates  due in large part to intense competition 
the impact of these and any future rate increases may be further reduction in our net interest margin 
shareholders equity increased from million at december  to million at december  we sold  shares of common stock in our second step conversion and received net proceeds of approximately million which was reduced by a million loan to the esop  net of principal repayment  to fund its purchase of  shares in the offering 
additionally  we issued  shares at an effective price of per share in conjunction with our acquisition of bsb and recorded million in equity representing the estimated fair value of bsb stock options exchanged for partners trust stock options 
the increase in shareholders equity also reflects the million in net income for and a million decrease in other comprehensive income  net of taxes 
in addition  we paid million in dividends  which reduced equity  and recorded million of equity related to the exercise of stock options 
average balance sheet the following tables set forth certain information for the years ended december   and for the years indicated  the total dollar amount of interest income from average earning assets and the resultant yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  is expressed both in dollars and rates 
no tax equivalent adjustments were made 
average balances are daily averages 
the bsb acquisition was completed on july   and as such  the average balances of our assets and liabilities reflects the assets and liabilities acquired and assumed for a period of days

rate volume analysis the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume  and iii net change 
the changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate

net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  which was million  or  lower than the same period in the decrease is primarily due to acquisition and conversion expenses of million pre tax and an after tax charge of million for other than temporary impairment of securities  which offset additional income realized from the growth in earning assets acquired in the bsb transaction 
net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended december  totaled million  an increase of over the million for the same period in the increase in net interest income reflects the substantial increase in net earning assets acquired from bsb 
the low interest rate environment  however  has continued to negatively affect our asset yields  and we have not been able to reduce our cost of funds to the same degree due to the already low rates paid on our deposit accounts and competitive pressures 
as a result  our interest rate spread and net interest margin were reduced in the bsb acquisition also had a negative impact on our interest rate spread and net interest margin 
the average yield on total loans acquired from bsb was below that of the company before the acquisition and bsb s cost of funds was also higher 
this  in conjunction with the net earning assets of bsb being approximately twice as large as that of the company at the time of the acquisition  resulted in a significant reduction of our margin 
by way of comparison  our net interest margin for the last full quarter prior to the acquisition was  versus a net interest margin of for bsb 
furthermore  our net interest margin was negatively impacted by amortization of the market value adjustments recorded in the acquisition premiums and discounts on loans  securities  deposits  and borrowings 
a reduction of million in net interest income was recorded in representing the net amortization of these market value adjustments 
this corresponded to an basis point reduction in net interest margin in the following table summarizes the expected impact on net interest income related to these items over their remaining life in thousands increase decrease in net interest income the net interest spread for the year ended december  was compared to for the same period in the net interest margin for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
we could experience further compression in our net interest margin if the current low rate environment continues or if competition for deposits increases  which would increase the cost of retaining or attracting deposits 
furthermore  the recent flattening of the yield curve could place additional pressure on our net interest margin as the gap between our short term deposit rates and our longer term loan rates narrows 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities was for the year ended december   compared with for the same period in  a reduction of basis points 
this reduction was not sufficient to offset the basis point reduction in the yield on earning assets period to period 
our ability to further reduce rates on deposits has diminished 
we priced our deposit account rates close to the lowest rates available in our marketplace for most of  and at levels below most other local community banks 
due to competitive pressure  we have begun to increase rates on deposits which will most likely decrease our net interest margin 
although we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs through borrowings  we will seek to retain core deposits and customer relationships 
provision for loan losses 
we establish provisions for loan losses  which are charged to operations  in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level management considers necessary to absorb probable credit losses in the current loan portfolio 
the amount of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or later events occur 
management assesses the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and makes provisions for loan losses in order to increase the allowance 
we recorded a provision for loan losses of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in non performing loans to total loans were and  at december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans and to total loans increased to and  respectively  at december  from and  respectively  at december  we consider the increased allowance coverage necessary due to the inherent risk in the loans that the company acquired from bsb 
non interest income 
the following table summarizes changes in the major components of non interest income dollars in thousands change change service fees trust and investment services income from bank owned life insurance other than temporary impairment of securities n a net loss on sale of securities available for sale n a net gain on sale of loans other income total non interest income the increase in service fees from to is primarily attributed to an increase in deposit accounts  deposit products and new products offered as a result of the bsb acquisition 
trust and investment services income increased  due primarily to the increase of approximately million in trust assets under management and an increase in the sale of non deposit investment products resulting from the bsb acquisition 
the increase of  on income from bank owned life insurance is primarily attributable to the policies acquired from bsb 
net loss on securities available for sale includes an other than temporary impairment writedown of million on fannie mae preferred stock as discussed in securities activities amortized cost and estimated fair value of securities above 
the decrease in net gain on sale of loans is primarily attributable to the  gain recognized in on the sale of agricultural loans as we sought to exit this business line 
non interest expense 
the following table summarizes changes in the major components of non interest expense dollars in thousands change change salaries and employee benefits occupancy and equipment expense marketing expense professional services technology expense contribution expense amortization of intangible assets acquisition and conversion expenses n a other expense total non interest expense the increase in non interest expense from to is due in large part to the impact of operating a much larger company 
increases in costs associated with the acquisition of bsb  including amortization of intangible assets  also affected non interest expense in the increase in salaries and employee benefits reflects the higher employment level of the merged company 
the number of full time and part time employees increased to and  respectively  at december  from and  respectively  at december  the company s branch network grew from to with the acquisition of bsb  and occupancy and equipment expense increased accordingly 
marketing expense increased million in due to our larger geographic presence and increased business development efforts 
furthermore  greater emphasis was placed on advertising in our markets in an effort to increase our brand recognition 
professional services increased million in  due in part to additional accounting and audit expenses of  related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of the rest of the increase is primarily attributable to the company s larger size 
technology expense increased due to the increased data processing cost associated with running a bank with a much larger customer base that offers a wider variety or products and services 
we added approximately  customer accounts as a result of the bsb acquisition  representing an increase in our customer accounts of approximately 
amortization of intangible assets increased million due to the significant increase in core deposit and trust intangible assets related to the bsb acquisition 
acquisition and conversion expenses of million were incurred in for the bsb acquisition 
we do not expect to incur any additional acquisition and conversion expenses related to the bsb acquisition 
other expense increased in due primarily to the growth in the size of the company  and included increases in postage  telephone  and insurance  expenses 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was million on income before taxes of million for the year ended december   resulting in an effective tax rate of compared to income tax expense of million on income before taxes of million for  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
the levels of tax expense generally fluctuates with the respective levels of income before income taxes 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily attributed to the higher ratio of tax exempt income to income before taxes 
the company operates a wholly owned real estate investment trust reit subsidiary  which was formed to acquire  hold and manage real estate mortgage assets  including but not limited to residential mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage loans 
the income earned on these assets  net of expenses  is distributed to the company in the form of dividends 
under current new york state tax law  of the dividends received from the reit are excluded from the company s taxable income 
the proposed new york state budget bill contains a provision that would disallow the exclusion of dividends paid by a real estate investment trust subsidiary 
the bill  if enacted as proposed  would be effective for taxable years beginning on or after january  assuming that the provision is passed as proposed  the company would lose the tax benefit associated with the reit 
in  the company s new york state tax expense was reduced by approximately  due to the reit s favorable tax treatment 
this tax reduction would have been approximately  had the acquisition of bsb occurred on january  supplemental reporting of non gaap results of operation s 
in addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we are providing in this report certain non gaap financial measures 
we believe that providing certain non gaap financial measures provides the reader with information useful in understanding our financial performance  our performance trends and financial position 
specifically  we provide measures based on core operating earnings  which excludes large non cash items such as net amortization of premium on net assets acquired in acquisitions  and amortization of intangibles 
we also exclude gains  losses or expenses such as acquisition and conversion expenses that are not reflective of on going operations or are not expected to recur because we consider these items to be nonoperating in nature 
these non gaap measures should not be considered a substitute for gaap basis measures and results 
our core operating earnings rose to million or per diluted share in  compared to million or per diluted share in and million or per diluted share in the per share amount for is calculated using income available to common shareholders for the period from the conversion from a mutual holding company to a stock holding company on april  through december  the following table reconciles core operating earnings to net income in accordance with gaap

comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and general 
net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  which was million  or  higher than the same period in the increase is primarily due to the acquisition of herkimer trust corporation  inc herkimer on december  and emphasis on net interest margin and expense control 
net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended december  totaled million  an increase of over the million for the same period in the net interest spread for the year ended december  was compared to for the same period in the net interest margin for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
the improvement in spread occurred as a result of acquiring generally higher yielding net earning assets from herkimer  which had more of a commercial banking nature  and because we aggressively managed our funding costs in a downward rate environment 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities was for the year ended december   compared with for the same period in  a reduction of basis points 
this reduction more than offset the basis point reduction in the yield on earning assets period to period 
we had an investment of million in federal home loan bank of new york fhlbny common stock at december  the fhlbny suspended the october dividend payment on this stock 
this announcement reduced interest income by approximately  or one quarter s dividend amount 
provision for loan losses 
we recorded a provision for loan losses of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in non interest income 
the following table summarizes changes in the major components of non interest income dollars in thousands change change service fees trust and investment services income from bank owned life insurance net loss on sale of securities available for sale net gain on sale of loans other income total non interest income the increase in non interest income from to is primarily attributed to an increase in fee generating deposit accounts and new products offered as a result of the herkimer acquisition  as well as efforts to expand fee generating product lines such as the sale of title insurance and non deposit investment products 
with the acquisition of herkimer at the end of  we began to offer trust and asset management services which resulted in  in income for the year ended december  commissions on sales of non deposit investment products increased  period to period  which is primarily attributable to increased emphasis on this product line 
the increase in net gain on sale of loans is primarily attributable to  in gains on the sale of agricultural loans as we sought to exit this business line 
these loans were classified as held for sale 
other income decreased for the year ended december  primarily because the results for were positively impacted by a  legal settlement 
there was no such amount in this was partially offset by a  increase in income from the sale of title insurance  which income totaled  in non interest expense 
the following table summarizes changes in the major components of non interest expense dollars in thousands change change salaries and employee benefits occupancy and equipment expense writedown of land and buildings held for sale marketing expense professional services technology expense contribution expense amortization of intangible assets n a acquisition expenses other expense total non interest expense the increase in non interest expense from to is primarily due to operating as a larger  more geographically diverse company as a result of the herkimer acquisition 
in  we recognized  of expense related to restricted stock granted under our long term stock based incentive plan that was adopted in the fourth quarter of during which time   of expense was recognized 
additionally  expense of our employee stock ownership plan the esop increased  due to an increase in our stock price 
the remaining increase in salary and employee benefits is primarily due to the additional employees retained from herkimer to staff the branches acquired 
we had full time equivalent employees at december   compared to at september   the most recent quarter prior to the herkimer acquisition 
occupancy and equipment expense increased primarily due to an increase in utilities  real estate taxes  rent and maintenance expenses related to the increase in the number of branches 
we had nine branches prior to the herkimer acquisition  compared with at december  the increase in professional services is primarily attributed to an increase in item processing costs due to increased account volume and increased legal fees incurred on a variety of routine matters 
technology expense increased primarily due to an increase in computer and atm expenses  again related to the increased locations and volumes related primarily to the herkimer acquisition 
in  we recorded a one time million contribution expense in connection with establishing the partners trust bank charitable foundation 
amortization of the core deposit and trust intangible assets related to herkimer was million for the year ended december  additionally  we recorded  of expense related to covenants not to compete with former herkimer employees 
all acquisition expenses related to the herkimer acquisition were recorded in  and there were no such expenses in other expense increased million  or 
expenses related to other real estate owned increased  primarily as a result of the  loss on the sale of a million property 
mortgage recording tax expense increased  during  which is attributed to a million increase in residential mortgage originations 
losses on our automatic overdraft program implemented in were  offsetting this increase was an increase in service fee income as previously discussed 
the remainder of the increase in other expenses is primarily due to increases in a variety of expenses primarily attributed to the effect of the herkimer acquisition 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was million on income before taxes of million for the year ended december   resulting in an effective tax rate of compared to income tax expense of million on income before taxes of million for  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily attributed to the higher net income before taxes resulting in a higher marginal tax rate 
impact of inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial condition and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increasing cost of our operations 
unlike those of most industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are nearly all monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or to the same extent  as the price of goods and services 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in the financial statements  or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used by us for general corporate purposes or for customer needs 
corporate purpose transactions are used to help manage credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk or to optimize capital 
customer transactions are used to manage customers requests for funding 
for the year ended december   we engaged in no off balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have the ability to maintain cash flows that are adequate to fund our operations and meet our debt obligations and other commitments on a timely and cost effective basis 
our liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of funds management 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  various forms of both short and long term borrowing provide an additional source of funds 
liquidity management at the bank focuses on its ability to generate sufficient cash to meet the funding needs of current loan demand  deposit withdrawals  principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding borrowings and to pay operating expenses 
it is the bank s policy to maintain greater liquidity than required in order to be in a position to fund loan originations and investments 
the bank monitors its liquidity in accordance with guidelines established by its board of directors and applicable regulatory requirements 
the bank s need for liquidity is affected by its loan activity  net changes in deposit levels and the scheduled maturities of its borrowings 
liquidity demand resulting from net reductions in deposits is usually caused by factors over which the bank has limited control 
the principal sources of the bank s liquidity consist of deposits  interest and principal payments and prepayments  its ability to sell assets at market prices and its ability to pledge its u nencumbered assets as collateral for borrowings  advances from the fhlb of new york and reverse repurchase agreements 
at december   the bank had million in available fhlb borrowing capacity  of which million was outstanding 
at december   the bank had outstanding commitments including undisbursed loan principal balances to originate loans of million 
certificates of deposit which are scheduled to mature within one year totaled million  excluding purchase accounting adjustments  at december   and borrowings that are scheduled to mature within the same period amounted to million  excluding purchase accounting adjustments  at such date 
deposit flows are affected by the level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by competitors and other factors 
based on our deposit retention experience we anticipate that a majority of the time deposits maturing within the next year will be retained  though competitive pressures have resulted in increased outflows  which may continue 
we are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position and monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis 
if deposit outflow increases beyond reasonable levels  we will readjust our deposit pricing strategy or take other measures  such as discontinuing our reinvestment of security payments or increasing borrowings  to ensure ample liquidity 
we anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments 
liquidity management at the holding company focuses on generating sufficient cash flow to pay dividends to common stockholders and to make interest payments on the junior subordinated obligations 
at december   the total interest payments due in on the junior subordinated obligations amounts to approximately million in the aggregate  based on the applicable interest rate at that date 
the company s primary sources of funds are net proceeds from capital offerings  dividends from the bank and investment income 
at december   the company had million of cash and securities available for sale at the holding company level 
under ots capital distribution regulations  the bank may pay dividends to the company without prior regulatory approval so long as the bank meets its applicable regulatory capital requirements before and after payment of the dividends and its total dividends do not exceed its net income to date over the calendar year plus retained net income over the preceding two years 
the ots has discretion to prohibit any otherwise permissible capital distributions on general safety and soundness grounds  and must be given days advance notice of all capital distributions 
at december   the bank had the ability to pay dividends of million to the company without the prior approval of the ots 
we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures for the foreseeable future  nor do we have any balloon or other payments due on any long term obligations  although million of fhlb advances at december  can be called by the fhlb at quarterly intervals 
if called  we have the option to reprice the advances at the then current fhlb rates  or to repay the advances 
the following table sets forth information about these advances at december  dollars in thousands weighted average maturity interest rate amount given the current interest rate environment  there is a possibility that some of these advances could be called in the near term 
at december   the bank exceeded all the applicable regulatory capital requirements 
although the office of thrift supervision does not impose minimum capital requirements on thrift holding companies  our consolidated regulatory capital amounts and ratios are discussed below 
the company s consolidated and the bank s leverage tier capital at december  was million and million  respectively  or and of assets  respectively 
in order to be classified as well capitalized under federal banking regulations  the bank was required to have leverage tier capital of at least million  or of assets 
to be classified as a well capitalized bank  the bank must also have a ratio of total risk based capital to risk weighted assets of at least 
at december   the bank s total risk based capital ratio was critical accounting policies management of the company considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance required for probable credit losses and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations 
management also considers the accounting policy relating to the test for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets to be a critical accounting policy due to the subjectivity and judgment involved and the material effect an impairment loss could have on the results of operations 
our policies on the allowance for loan losses and goodwill and intangible assets are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
a more detailed description of our methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is included in the asset quality section in part  item of this report 
all accounting policies are important  and as such  we encourage the reader to review each of the policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements to obtain a better understanding of how our financial performance is reported 
impact of new accounting standards in december of  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop no 
 accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
sop no 
addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor s initial investment in loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
this sop prohibits carry over or creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting of all loans acquired in transfers within the scope of sop no 
 which includes loans acquired in a purchase business combination 
sop no 
is effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  we did not adopt sop no 
early 
the adoption of sop no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  but it could have an impact on our acco unting for future acquisitions 
in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act became law in the united states 
the act introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the medicare benefit 
we maintain a postretirement benefit plan the plan that was impacted by the act 
see footnote to the audited financial statements for further information 
to date  guidance has not been finalized on how to measure actuarial equivalence and the corresponding subsidy when employees pay a significant portion of plan costs 
consequently  due to the employee cost sharing  and the lack of complete guidance on how to treat employee cost sharing  it is unclear whether the plan will be deemed to provide actuarially equivalent prescription drug benefits to those to be provided by medicare 
preliminary estimates of the potential subsidy if any  indicate that such subsidy would have an immaterial effect on the measurement of costs and liabilities for this plan 
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net postretirement benefit cost related to the plan do not reflect any amount associated with the subsidy because we are unable to conclude whether the benefits provided by the plan are actuarially equivalent to medicare part d of the act 
on march   the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 application of accounting principles to loan commitments 
sab no 
requires that when a company is recognizing and valuing a loan commitment at fair value  only differences between the guaranteed interest rate in the loan commitment and a market interest rate should be included 
any expected future cash flows related to the customer relationships or loan servicing should be excluded from the fair value measurement 
the expected future cash flows that are excluded from the fair value determination include anticipated fees for servicing the funded loan  late payment charges  other ancillary fees  or other cash flows from servicing rights 
the guidance in sab no 
is effective for mortgage loan commitments that are accounted for as derivatives and are entered into after march  the provisions of this bulletin did not have a material impact on the results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 share based payment 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and its related implementation guidance 
this statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments unless observable market prices for the same or similar instruments are available 
if an equity award is modified after the grant date  incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount eq ual to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification 
excess tax benefits  as defined by this statement  will be recognized as an addition to paid in capital 
cash retained as a result of those excess tax benefits will be presented in the statement of cash flows as financing cash inflows 
the write off of deferred tax assets relating to unrealized tax benefits associated with recognized compensation cost will be recognized as income tax expense unless there are excess tax benefits from previous awards remaining in paid in capital to which it can be offset 
this statement is effective for the company as of july  and may be adopted prospectively or retrospectively 
adoption of this statement will affect the company s results of operations 
the extent of the impact has not yet been quantified 
contractual obligations we are contractually obliged to make payments as follows in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years federal home loan bank borrowings junior subordinated obligations operating leases other total obligations includes fair value adjustment of million at december  on borrowings assumed from bsb 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk qualitative analysi s 
because the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates  our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
we are vulnerable to an increase in interest rates to the extent that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more rapidly than interest earning assets 
the primary objective of our interest rate risk policy is to manage the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates 
we actively monitor interest rate risk in connection with our lending  investing  deposit and borrowing activities 
we do not hold any of our assets for trading purposes 
as discussed in an earlier section of this report  our net interest margin decreased in we could see further compression in our net interest margin if the current low rate environment continues or if competition for deposits increases  which would drive up the cost of retaining or attracting deposits 
furthermore  the recent flattening of the yield curve could place additional pressure on our net interest margin as the gap between our short term deposit rates and our longer term loan rates narrows 
quantitative analysis 
our interest rate sensitivity is monitored through the use of a net interest income simulation model  which generates estimates of the change in our net interest income over a range of interest rate scenarios 
the model assumes loan prepayment rates  reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates based on historical experience and current conditions 
the following table sets forth the result of our net interest income simulation model as of december  and change in interest in basis points annual net interest income annual net interest income rate shock amount change change amount change change dollars in thousands flat the above table indicates that as of december  we had a relatively well matched interest rate risk profile 
in the event of an immediate basis point increase in interest rates across the yield curve  we estimate that we would experience a  or million  decrease in net interest income 
in the event of an immediate basis point decrease in interest rates across the yield curve  we estimate that we would experience a  or  decrease in net interest income 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurement 
modeling changes in net interest income requires the making of certain assumptions regarding prepayment and deposit decay rates  which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
while we believe such assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepaym ent rates and decay rates will approximate actual future loan prepayment and deposit withdrawal activity 
moreover  the net interest income table presented assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the net interest income table provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results
