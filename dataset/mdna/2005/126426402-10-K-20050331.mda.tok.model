the company reviewed its accounting with respect to leasing transactions and has concluded there was an error in the determination of lease expense for certain leases related primarily to wireless cell tower sites 
the company had not properly reflected rent escalation provisions contained in its leases on a straight line basis as required by sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
to correct this error  the company has considered the escalation provisions of the leases and has considered renewal periods when there is reasonable assurance that one or more of the renewal options would be exercised 
the result of the company s assessment was to increase the lease term as defined in sfas no 
for most of its operating leases 
the cumulative impact of this error at december  is a reduction of retained earnings of million

in addition  the company also reclassified to other assets million of certain items previously recorded as accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheet at december  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding these restatement matters 
introduction ct communications  inc and its subsidiaries provide a broad range of telecommunications and related services to residential and business customers located primarily in north carolina 
the company s primary services include local and long distance telephone service  internet and data services and wireless products and services 
the company has worked to expand its core businesses through the development of integrated product and service offerings  investment in growth initiatives that exceed certain return thresholds and targeted marketing efforts to efficiently identify and obtain customers 
in addition  the company has made certain strategic investments that complement its business units 
during  the company expanded its wireless business through the partitioning of its area of the cingular digital networks 
the company believes that it is positioning itself to achieve its strategic objectives by devoting substantial effort to developing business plans  enhancing its management team and board of directors  and designing and developing its business support and operating systems 
on september   the company announced a plan to significantly enhance its broadband capabilities in its ilec territory 
the initiative involves an estimated million capital investment that  upon completion  is expected to allow the company to offer broadband service speeds of up to megabits per second throughout much of its ilec territory  a significant improvement over current dsl and cable modem speeds 
the initiative is planned for completion in late  and higher speed broadband services were introduced by the company in selected areas of its network in the company also continues to focus on maximizing the ilec business in its current markets by cross selling bundled products and packages and growing its customer base through its clec  greenfield  internet and data services  and wireless businesses 
the company will also consider strategic acquisitions and investments as opportunities arise 
net income for the company was million in compared to million in and million in income from continuing operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were  and in  and respectively 
overall  was a strong year for the company as operating income increased to million and revenue increased to million 
wireless operating income nearly doubled from to million with a increase in net customers 
the company s ilec continued to experience a loss of access lines as its customers selected from several alternative service providers 
the competitive clec and greenfield wireline businesses continued to experience strong demand for their products and services in that resulted in and access line growth  respectively 
the replacement of higher margin ilec lines with lower margin clec and greenfield lines will continue to pressure operating margins downward 
however  the company is continuously evaluating opportunities for process improvements and efficiency gains to offset the transition to competitive  lower margin accounts 
operating margins in the clec and greenfield businesses should continue to be positively impacted as the company leverages existing transport infrastructure to support new customers 
industry and operating trends the telecommunications industry continues to evolve into a highly competitive business faced with the challenge of evolving their organizations  services  processes and systems that are capable of successfully competing for and retaining customers 
the company s ilec is facing more competitive pressure than any other time in its year history 
wireless providers and clec s have targeted the company s customers and will continue to promote low cost  flexible communications alternatives 
the more recent introduction of cable telephony and voip services will become more significant threats to the company s voice business in the coming years 
these technologies are capable of delivering a quality  competitive voice service to the company s ilec customers at a lower cost 
these voice providers are not subject to certain regulatory constraints that have shaped the company s business model and that will become more significant impediments to its ability to successfully compete in the coming years 
in particular  the ilec must provide certain basic services to all customers in its regulated service area  regardless of the cost to provide that service 
the company is the beneficiary of certain cost reimbursements that are intended to offset certain costs to provide service 
these reimbursements are increasingly at risk and being reduced  yet its service obligations remain unchanged 
the future risk and uncertainty of regulatory service requirements and the recovery of expense subsidies will impact the company s ability to maintain existing margins and profitability 
as discussed above  voip and cable telephony are becoming more available to customers and could result in lower revenues throughout the company s businesses 
time warner currently offers cable television and high speed internet service and is expected to offer cable telephony in the ilec service area  which could result in a loss of access lines  a reduction in ilec revenue including long distance revenue  and a reduction in internet revenue 
in addition  wireless substitution is also a trend that is impacting the ilec business as well as the company s long distance revenue 
some customers are choosing to substitute their landline service with wireless service 
the company believes this has contributed to the access line decrease in the ilec over the past several years 
also impacting access line losses over the past several years is the adoption of dsl and high speed internet services by customers that had traditionally subscribed to dial up internet service 
as customers switch to dsl or high speed internet service  they no longer need a second landline for use with their dial up internet service 
during the company experienced a decline in the recovery of wireless interconnection access fee revenue 
this decline leveled off in but the company expects continued pressure from other telecommunications providers to lower its recovery of fees for terminating their traffic on its network 
in the company s wireless business  increasing competition  market saturation and an uncertain economy have caused and will likely continue to cause the wireless industry s subscriber growth rate to moderate in comparison to historical growth rates 
while the wireless telecommunications industry does continue to grow  a high degree of competition exists among carriers 
this competition will continue to put pressure upon pricing and margins as carriers compete for potential customers 
future carrier revenue growth is highly dependent upon the number of net customer additions a carrier can achieve and the average revenue per user derived from its customers 
regulatory requirements have grown in certain areas of the company s business and have added complexity and expense to its business model 
in november  the company was required to provide number portability to wireless carriers 
this service allows greater customer choice in their telecommunications provider  without the need to change established end user contact numbers 
while this service certainly enhances customer choice  it negatively impacts the company s cost to provide basic service 
as federal and state agencies continue their pursuit of opening all telecommunications services to competition  additional expenses are likely to be incurred by the established local exchange carriers to facilitate more open networks 
since september  the ilec s rates for local exchange services have been established under a price regulation plan approved by the ncuc 
under the price regulation plan  the company s charges are no longer subject to rate base  rate of return regulation 
instead  rates for most of the company s local exchange services may be adjusted by the company  provided that such rate adjustments would not result in projected revenue changes that would exceed changes in inflation reduced by a assumed productivity offset 
the price regulation plan also allows flexibility for adjustments based on certain external events outside of the company s control  such as jurisdictional cost shifts or legislative mandates 
in previous years  the company has rebalanced certain rates under the price regulation plan 
the price rebalancing arrangement allows the company to continue adjusting revenues to keep them in line with related costs 
the primary result has been an increase in the monthly basic service charges paid by residential customers  a decrease in access charges paid by interexchange carriers and a decrease in rates paid by end users for an expanded local calling scope 
in december  the company filed a petition with the ncuc in which it requested  among other things  deregulation of certain competitive services  additional pricing flexibility for regulated services  elimination of the productivity offset and an initial  limited increase in local calling rates in exchange for providing the customers with a larger local calling scope 
the company expects that the ncuc will conduct hearings on the company s request during the company s clec relies in part on unbundled network elements obtained from the applicable incumbent local exchange carrier 
the fcc has recently relieved some of the unbundling obligations on such incumbent carriers to make some of such elements available at cost based rates 
although the company is still assessing the impact of the fcc s latest decision  the company does not at this time expect that decision will have a material impact on the company  but does anticipate that the unbundling requirements will continue to be eroded by the fcc and possibly the courts 
as a result of this trend  the costs associated with the utilization of leased network elements likely will continue to increase 
the company s clec has reduced its reliance on the leased elements in recent years  and intends to continue that trend by moving more of its existing customers to its own network facilities and by targeting clec business opportunities that can be served through existing facilities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company continuously evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  restructuring charges  long lived assets  investments  income taxes  pensions and post retirement benefits  and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note to the consolidated financial statements included herein describes the company s significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when services are provided regardless of the period in which they are billed 
revenues from sales of telephone equipment are recognized upon delivery to the customer for direct sales of equipment while revenues from sales type leases are recognized upon delivery to the customer in an amount equal to the present value of the minimum rental payments under the fixed non cancelable lease term 
the deferred finance charges applicable to these leases are recognized over the terms of the leases using the effective interest method 
installation fees associated with sales of products or services to end users are deferred and the related costs are capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of the customer in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
certain interstate rates charged by the company are regulated by the fcc and may be subject to potential over earnings claims if the company s interstate rates result in earnings over the fcc s prescribed rate of return 
the company maintains a reserve related to over earnings based on management s estimate of potential liability for the company 
management periodically assesses the company s potential liability and makes adjustments as applicable 
changes in management s estimate could result from changes in current and future legislation  regulatory filings and fcc rulings  as well as any other factors that may impact management s estimate 
the company also participates in a revenue pooling arrangement with other local exchange carriers administered by neca 
revenue earned through this pooling arrangement is initially recorded based on the company s cost estimates and revised as these costs and related settlements are finalized 
the company periodically makes claims for recovery of access charges on certain minutes of use terminated by the company on behalf of other carriers 
management believes these claims that have not been accepted by other carriers have merit and there will be a resolution in the future regarding these claims 
however  management is unable to estimate the recovery and is not reasonably assured of collection 
as a result of this uncertainty  the company has not recorded revenue for these items 
upon assurance of collectability  the company will recognize revenue in the period that assurance or collection occurs 
wireless revenues are recognized in accordance with eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
based on the provisions of eitf no 
 the company divides these arrangements into separate units of accounting  including the wireless service and handset 
arrangement consideration received for the handset is recognized as equipment sales when the handset is delivered and accepted by the subscriber 
arrangement consideration received for the wireless service is recognized as service revenues when earned 
any non refundable  up front activation fee charged to the subscriber is allocated to the handset and to the extent that the aggregate handset and activation fee proceeds do not exceed the fair value of the handset is recognized as revenue when the handset is delivered and accepted by the subscriber 
restructuring charges the company periodically records charges resulting from restructuring operations  including consolidations and or relocations of operations  changes in its strategic plan  or managerial responses to declines in demand  increasing costs  or other environmental factors 
the company discontinued its wireless broadband trial and recognized a loss of approximately million in to write down the related carrying amounts of assets to their fair values less cost to sell and recorded related liabilities for estimated severance costs  lease termination costs  and other exit costs in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in restructuring 
the determination of restructuring charges requires management s judgment and may include costs related to employee benefits  such as costs of severance and termination benefits  and costs for future lease commitments of excess facilities  net of estimated future sublease income 
in determining the amount of the facilities charge  the company is required to estimate such factors as future vacancy rates  the time required to sublet properties and sublease rates 
these estimates will be reviewed and potentially revised on a quarterly basis based on known real estate market conditions and the credit worthiness of subtenants  resulting in revisions to established facility reserves 
goodwill and intangible assets the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  and accordingly  the company no longer amortizes goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  changes in technology  a significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period or a reduction of the company s market capitalization relative to net book value 
the company s net goodwill and other intangible assets totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the company performed an initial review of goodwill and other intangible assets upon adoption of sfas no 
and will perform reviews annually thereafter as of december no impairment charges were required at december   and long lived assets the company continually evaluates the estimated useful lives of its property and equipment in computing depreciation expense 
consideration is given to technological advances and utilization of its existing facilities 
the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets effective january   which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flow estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
the company s policy is to review the carrying value of property and equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets 
investments the company holds certain investments and investment securities that it evaluates to determine whether unrealized losses are other than temporary 
the company performs this evaluation quarterly by comparing market price of the investments and securities to the current recorded value 
based on this evaluation and consideration of other factors  the company determines the classification of unrealized losses and record charges to adjust the carrying value of these investments 
the company also holds certain other investments and investments in unconsolidated companies that it evaluates to determine if the investment is impaired 
the determination of fair market value is based on historical and projected information regarding the investment and on management s estimates 
if it is determined that the fair market value of the investment is less than the current recorded value and it is deemed to be other than temporary  the company records charges to adjust the carrying value of these investments 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent it believes that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period  it must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets 
net deferred tax liabilities at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
the company has recognized a valuation allowance of million and million at december  and  respectively 
pension and post retirement benefits the decline in equity markets in recent years coupled with record low interest rates have negatively impacted companies with defined benefit pension plans 
these factors have decreased plan assets that are available to pay plan benefits at the same time the cost of providing benefits has increased 
the company used a discount rate of in valuing its pension and post retirement benefit obligations at december  in addition  the company has assumed an long term expected return on assets 
the pension benefit obligation increased to approximately million with plan assets at december  valued at million 
this compares with a benefit obligation of million at december   with plan assets valued at million 
although difficult to predict because of the relation to market performance  the company does not anticipate making a cash contribution to meet minimum required funding thresholds in the post retirement benefit obligation related to the company s health care plan that provides post retirement medical benefits and life insurance coverage to certain employees was million at december  and is not funded by the company 
the company has adopted sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions  and is amortizing the estimated transition liability over years 
allowance for doubtful accounts management judgment is required in assessing the collectability of customer accounts and other receivables 
the company accordingly maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
management specifically analyzes individual accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in its customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  obligations  guarantees or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that have  or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company s financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
results of operations the company has identified reportable segments based on the common characteristics of products and services and or the customers served 
the identified reportable segments are ilec  clec  greenfield  wireless  internet and data services ids and palmetto mobilenet 
all other businesses that do not meet reporting guidelines and thresholds are reported under other business units 
the company has a limited partnership interest in palmetto mobilenet that is accounted for as an equity investment 
palmetto mobilenet s financial statements are included on pages f through f of this report 
the following discussion reviews the results of the company s consolidated operations and specific results within each reportable segment 
consolidated operating results in thousands  except lines and subscribers restated restated total operating revenue total operating expense operating income depreciation capital expenditures total assets ending wired access lines ending wireless subscribers compared to operating revenue increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the increase is attributable to a million increase in wireless revenue driven by a increase in customers and an increase in network traffic  a million increase in greenfield revenue driven by a increase in greenfield access lines and a million increase in ids revenue 
these increases were offset by a decrease in ilec revenue of million primarily due to a decrease in wireless interconnection revenue and line related revenue and a decrease in clec revenue of million 
the company has diversified its operating revenue significantly over the past two years due to the growth in its competitive businesses 
for  ilec revenue represented of total revenue compared to in  while wireless has grown to of total revenue  up from in  the combined clec and greenfield businesses have grown to of total revenue up from in and internet revenue represented of total revenue in compared to in in  operating expense increased million or compared to this increase is primarily due to an increase in switching and settlement expenses in the wireless business and an increase in expenses in the greenfield business related to the increase in access lines 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in medical benefit expenses related to a decreasing rate of claims during  a million settlement of certain lease obligations and generally lower spending across several network and administrative categories 
income tax expense in the fourth quarter of includes charges related to a settlement of north carolina department of revenue tax audits of  and tax years  as well as certain other disputed state tax matters 
the company advanced a payment of million to settle all matters and received the final executed settlement agreement on march  these charges were substantially offset in the fourth quarter by previous tax accruals related to this settlement and an income tax benefit associated with the sale and disposal of the webserve product line 
webserve was acquired in december and later combined into the internet business unit to enhance the company s suite of data products by providing web design and development services 
the web design and development product line was sold in the fourth quarter  which had no material impact on reported pre tax income from continuing operations 
operating margin increased to in from in this increase in operating margin is primarily due to the increase in revenue and the company s focus on expense containment 
compared to operating revenue increased million or for the year ended december  when compared to the increase was attributable to a million increase in clec revenue driven primarily by an increase in access lines  a million increase in wireless revenue driven by a increase in customers and an increase in network traffic  a million increase in greenfield revenue driven by a increase in greenfield access lines  a million increase in ilec revenue and a million increase in ids revenue 
overall  total operating revenue increased in all operating segments in compared to in  the company s ilec recognized million in additional interstate revenue from neca related to icls support and a common line revenue pooling arrangement 
in addition  during  the company recorded adjustments to its reserves for over earnings claims 
certain interstate rates charged by the company are regulated by the fcc and may be subject to potential over earnings claims if the company s interstate rates result in earnings over the fcc s prescribed rate of return 
the company maintains a reserve related to over earnings based on management s estimate of potential liability for the company 
during  the company recorded a net adjustment to these reserves that increased operating revenue by approximately million 
in  the company recorded a net adjustment that decreased operating revenue by million 
as of december   the company s total over earnings reserve was approximately million 
management periodically assesses the company s potential liability and makes adjustments as applicable 
changes in management s estimate could result from changes in current and future legislation  regulatory filings and fcc rulings  as well as any other factors that may impact management s estimate 
the company diversified operating revenue significantly in compared to due to the growth in its competitive businesses 
for  ilec revenue represented of total revenue compared to in  while wireless grew to of total revenue  up from in  the combined clec and greenfield businesses grew to of total revenue up from in and internet revenue represented of total revenue compared to in in  operating expense increased million or as compared to this increase was primarily the result of increases in depreciation expense of million  increases in compensation and benefit expenses  and increases in expenses related to customer growth including minutes of use in the company s clec  greenfield and wireless businesses 
operating margin increased slightly to in from in this increase in operating margin was primarily due to the increase in revenue 
ilec in thousands  except lines restated restated total operating revenue total operating expense operating income depreciation expense capital expenditures total assets ending business access lines ending residential access lines ending total access lines ending long distance lines compared to operating revenue for the ilec decreased million or for compared to the reduction in revenue is primarily due to a decrease in wireless interconnection revenue of million due to lower access rates  a decrease in long distance revenue of million  a decrease in telephone system sales of million and a million reduction in revenues recognized from neca usf support 
long distance revenue declined due to a reduction in toll revenue as more customers are moving to calling plans that include unlimited minutes of use 
the decrease in access lines is due in part to an increase in broadband internet adoption by customers that have cancelled second lines previously used for dial up internet service as well as increased competition from wireless and other competitive providers 
these decreases in revenue were partially offset by an increase in access and interconnection revenue due to an increase in minutes of use on the company s network 
operating expense in the ilec was flat in compared to the primary changes within operating expense were higher corporate related expenses offset by a decrease in compensation and benefit expense of million  a decrease in expenses related to phone system sales of million and a decrease in depreciation expense of million 
operating expense was flat while operating revenue declined resulting in a decline in operating margin from in to in the company will continue to focus on gaining operational efficiencies to offset lower revenue due to access lines losses 
capital expenditures in were of ilec operating revenue compared to of revenue in on september   the company announced a plan to significantly enhance its broadband capabilities in its ilec territory 
the initiative involves an estimated million capital investment that  upon completion  is expected to allow the company to offer broadband service speeds of up to megabits per second throughout much of its ilec territory  a significant improvement over current dsl and cable modem speeds 
the initiative is planned for completion in late  and the company implemented higher speed broadband services in in selected areas of its network 
approximately million had been spent on capital expenditures related to this initiative as of december  ilec access lines subscribing to the company s long distance service increased slightly in despite a access line loss 
at the end of  of ilec access lines subscribed to its long distance service  up from at year end despite the increase in ilec customers subscribing to the company s long distance service  long distance revenue has declined 
compared to operating revenue for the ilec increased million or for compared to the increase in revenue consisted of a million increase in settlement revenue partially offset by a million decrease in cellular interconnection revenue  a million decrease in long distance revenue and a decrease in local revenue due to the decrease in access lines 
the primary reason for the increase in settlement revenue in was million in federal support received through neca and a million change in the company s over earnings reserves 
the decrease in access lines was partly due to an increase in dsl internet adoption that lead some customers to cancel second lines previously used for dial up internet service as well as increased competition from wireless providers 
at december   approximately  second lines remained in service 
operating expense in the ilec increased million or for compared to the primary drivers of this increase were higher compensation and benefits expense and increased depreciation expense  partially offset by a decrease in cellular interconnection expense 
operating expense continued to increase at a faster rate than operating revenue in resulting in a decline in operating margin from in to in capital expenditures in were of ilec operating revenue compared to of revenue in ilec access lines subscribing to the company s long distance service increased slightly in despite a access line loss 
at the end of  of ilec access lines subscribed to the company s long distance service  up from at year end despite the increase in ilec customers subscribing to the company s long distance service  long distance revenue declined 
long distance minutes of use increased significantly in compared to however  increased competition forced rates per minute down and as a result  long distance revenue declined despite an increase in minutes of use 
clec in thousands  except lines restated restated total operating revenue total operating expense operating income loss depreciation expense capital expenditures total assets ending access lines ending long distance lines in the second quarter of  the company changed its methodology for counting clec long distance lines 
the new methodology is more consistent with that used to count clec access lines 
the number of lines presented for and has been revised to reflect this change in methodology 
compared to clec operating revenue was million in  representing a million or decrease from the million decrease consists of a million decrease in access revenue partially offset by a million increase in line related revenue and a million increase in long distance revenue 
the increase in line related revenue is primarily attributable to a increase in access lines during the million decrease in access revenue was due primarily to the collection of approximately million in previously disputed access fees in and a reduction in interstate switched access rates 
the fcc previously ordered the gradual reduction in switched access rates charged by competitive local exchange carriers 
effective june   the fcc directed that switched access rates charged by clecs to long distance companies for interstate traffic be reduced from per minute to per minute 
effective june   the final phase of the rate reductions were implemented  which reduced the clec switched access rate to that charged by incumbent local exchange carriers 
the change resulted in a significant reduction in the company s clec interstate access rate  which reduced the clec s access revenue by approximately million in and will continue to decline in clec operating expense was million and million in and  respectively 
this decrease is primarily due to lower compensation and benefits expense of million 
operating expense decreased while revenue declined 
as a result of the lower compensation and benefits expense  operating margins increased to in compared to in compared to clec operating revenue was million in  representing a million or increase over the million increase consisted of a million increase in recurring line revenue and a million increase in access revenue 
the increase in recurring line revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in access lines during the million increase in access revenue was due primarily to the collection of approximately million in previously disputed access fees in and an increase in minutes of use 
effective june   the fcc directed that switched access rates charged by clecs to long distance companies for interstate traffic be reduced from per minute to per minute 
this rate reduction resulted in a decrease in access revenue of approximately million in clec operating expense was million in and operating expense was flat despite revenue growth of 
as a result  operating margin increased to in compared to in the improvement in operating margins was due primarily to the increase in access lines and the collection of million of previously disputed access fee revenue 
greenfield in thousands  except lines and signed provider agreements restated restated total operating revenue total operating expense operating income loss depreciation expense capital expenditures total assets ending access lines ending long distance lines total signed provider agreements compared to greenfield revenue increased million in to million compared to million for access lines increased in related to the ongoing build out of developments covered by signed telecommunications provider agreements 
this increase in access lines drove a million increase in line related revenue 
in addition  long distance revenue increased million due to a increase in long distance lines and access revenue increased approximately million in as the minutes of use on the company s network increases with customer growth 
the greenfield business signed provider agreements in  bringing the total number of signed agreements to these agreements represent a potential  access lines once these developments have been completely built out 
the expected residential business line mix of these projects is expected to be residential and business 
operating expense increased in to million  related primarily to the increase in access lines and a million increase in depreciation expense 
the increase in access lines and related minutes of use on the company s network has resulted in million increase in combined access and transport expenses 
the increase in depreciation expense is associated with the up front capital expenditures required in most of the developments 
capital expenditures in increased million compared to at the end of  of greenfield access lines also subscribed to the company s long distance service  up from in this increase is mainly due to the fact that many of the early greenfield access lines were business lines located in mall projects 
business customers in malls historically do not elect the company s long distance service as frequently as residential customers since many retail businesses have national long distance contracts 
as the residential percentage of greenfield access lines increases the company has seen the long distance penetration rates increase
