item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview fiscal was another record year for us 
home sales revenues increased by over fiscal and net income increased by 
in addition  contract signings increased in fiscal over fiscal and our backlog of homes under contract but not yet delivered to home buyers backlog at october  was greater than the backlog at october  geographic and product diversification  access to lower cost capital  a versatile and abundant home mortgage market and improving demographics are promoting strong and steady demand for those builders who can control land and persevere through the increasingly difficult regulatory approval process 
this evolution in our industry favors the large  publicly traded home building companies with the capital and expertise to control home sites and gain market share 
we currently own or control more than  home sites in markets we consider to be affluent  a substantial number of which sites already have the approvals necessary for development 
we believe that as the approval process becomes more difficult  and as the political pressure from no growth proponents increases  our expertise in taking land through the approval process and our already approved land positions should allow us to continue to grow for a number of years to come 
because of the strong demand for our homes  we have been able to increase the base selling prices in many of our communities during the past several years 
based on our current backlog  which affords us revenue visibility over the next to months  and the pace of current demand  we expect to deliver between  and  homes during fiscal  with an average delivered price between  and  in addition  in fiscal we expect that net income will increase by at least over net income for fiscal because of the length of time that it takes to obtain the necessary approvals on a property  complete the land improvements on it  and deliver a home after a home buyer signs an agreement of sale  we are subject to many risks 
we attempt to reduce certain risks by controlling land for future development through options whenever possible  thus allowing us to obtain the necessary governmental approvals before acquiring title to the land  generally commencing construction of a home after executing an agreement of sale with a buyer  and using subcontractors to perform home construction and land development work on a fixed price basis 
in the ordinary course of doing business  we must make estimates and judgments that affect decisions on how we operate and on the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates include  but are not limited to  those related to the recognition of income and expenses  impairment of assets  estimates of future improvement and amenity costs  capitalization of costs to inventory  provisions for litigation  insurance and warranty costs  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate and adjust our estimates based on the information currently available 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions or conditions 
our revenues have grown on average over per year in the last decade 
we have funded this growth through the reinvestment of profits  bank borrowings and capital market transactions 
at october   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately million available under our new bank revolving credit facility which extends to july  in addition  during the second quarter of  we issued million of senior notes due we used a portion of the proceeds from these notes to redeem million of our senior subordinated notes due with these resources  our strong cash flow from operations before inventory growth  and our history of success in accessing the public debt markets  we believe we have the resources available to continue to grow in fiscal and beyond 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in addition to direct acquisition  land development and home construction costs  costs include interest  real estate taxes and direct overhead costs related to development and construction  which are capitalized to inventories during the period beginning with the commencement of development and ending with the completion of construction 
it takes approximately four to five years to fully develop  sell and deliver all the homes in one of our typical communities 
longer or shorter time periods are possible depending on the number of home sites in a community 
our master planned communities  consisting of several smaller communities  may take up to years or more to complete 
because our inventory is considered a long lived asset under us generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to review the carrying value of each of our communities and write down the value of those communities for which we believe the values are not recoverable 
when the profitability of a current community deteriorates or the sales pace declines significantly or some other factor indicates a possible impairment in the recoverability of the asset  we evaluate the property in accordance with the guidelines of sfas no 
if this evaluation indicates that an impairment loss should be recognized  we charge cost of sales for the estimated impairment loss in the period determined 
in addition  we review all land held for future communities or future sections of current communities  whether owned or under contract  to determine whether or not we expect to proceed with the development of the land 
based upon this review  we decide a as to land that is under a purchase contract but not owned  whether the contract will be terminated or renegotiated  and b as to land we own  whether the land can be developed as contemplated or in an alternative manner  or should be sold 
we then further determine which costs that have been capitalized to the property are recoverable and which costs should be written off 
income recognition revenue and cost of sales are recorded at the time each home  or home site  is delivered and title and possession are transferred to the buyer 
land  land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future are amortized to the cost of homes closed based upon the total number of homes to be constructed in each community 
any changes to the estimated costs subsequent to the commencement of delivery of homes are allocated to the remaining undelivered homes in the community 
home construction and related costs are charged to the cost of homes closed under the specific identification method 
the estimated land  common area development and related costs of master planned communities including the cost of golf courses  net of their estimated residual value are allocated to individual communities within a master planned community on a relative sales value basis 
any change in the estimated cost is allocated to the remaining home sites in each of the communities of the master planned community 
off balance sheet arrangements we have investments in and advances to several joint ventures with unrelated parties to develop land 
some of these joint ventures develop land for the sole use of the venture partners  including ourselves  and others develop land for sale to the venture partners and to unrelated builders 
we recognize our share of earnings from the sale of home sites to other builders 
we do not recognize earnings from home sites we purchase from the joint ventures  but instead reduce our cost basis in these home sites by our share of the earnings on the home sites 
at october   we had approximately million invested in or advanced to these joint ventures and were committed to contributing additional capital in an aggregate amount of approximately million if the joint ventures require it 
in november  one of the joint ventures obtained third party financing of million  of which each of the joint venture partners guaranteed their pro rata share 
our share of the loan guarantee was million  which has reduced the amount committed to the funding of the joint venture 
in january  we entered into a joint venture in which we have a interest with an unrelated party  to develop maxwell place  an home luxury condominium community on the hoboken  new jersey waterfront 
at october   we had investments in and advances to the joint venture of million  and were committed to making up to million of additional investments in and advances to it 
we and our joint venture partner each have guaranteed million of principal amount of one of the loans obtained by this joint venture

fiscal compared to fiscal home sales home sales revenues for fiscal of billion  homes were higher than those of fiscal by approximately billion  or 
the increase was attributable to a increase in the number of homes delivered and a increase in the average price of homes delivered 
the increase in the number of homes delivered in fiscal was primarily due to the higher backlog of homes at october  as compared to october  which was primarily the result of a increase in the number of new contracts signed in fiscal over fiscal  and a increase in the number of contracts signed in the first six months of fiscal as compared to the first six months of fiscal the increase in the average price of homes delivered in fiscal was the result of increased base selling prices and a shift in the location of homes delivered to more expensive areas offset  in part  by a change in the mix of product types delivered 
the value of new sales contracts signed was billion  homes in fiscal  a increase over the billion  homes value of new sales contracts signed in fiscal the increase in fiscal was attributable to a increase in the number of new sales contracts signed and a increase in the average selling price of the homes 
the increase in the number of new sales contracts signed in fiscal was attributable to the continued demand for our homes and the increase in the number of communities from which we were selling homes 
we were selling from communities at october   compared to communities at october  at october  we expect to be selling from approximately communities 
we believe that the demand for our homes is attributable to an increase in the number of affluent households  the maturation of the baby boom generation  a constricted supply of available new home sites in our markets  attractive mortgage rates and the belief of potential customers that the purchase of a home is a stable investment 
at october   we had over  home sites under our control nationwide  compared to approximately  home sites at october  the increase in the average price of homes contracted for in fiscal was the result of increased base selling prices and a shift in the location of homes delivered to more expensive areas 
at october   our backlog of homes under contract was billion  homes  an increase of over the billion  homes backlog at october  the increase in backlog at october   compared to the backlog at october   was primarily attributable to the increase in the number and average price of new contracts signed during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  offset  in part  by an increase in the number and average price of homes delivered in fiscal as compared to fiscal based on the size of our current backlog  the continued demand for our products  the increased number of selling communities from which we are operating and the additional communities we expect to open in the coming months  we believe that we will deliver between  and  homes in fiscal we estimate that the average price of the homes delivered will be between  and  in fiscal home costs as a percentage of home sales revenues decreased basis points in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of selling prices increasing at a greater rate than construction costs 
inventory write offs of million in fiscal were higher than the million of write offs in fiscal as a percentage of home sales revenues  write offs in fiscal were comparable to fiscal for fiscal  we expect that home costs as a percentage of home sales will be approximately to basis points lower than the fiscal percentage 
land sales we are developing several communities in which we sell a portion of the land to other builders 
the amount of land sales will vary from year to year depending upon the scheduled timing of the delivery of the land parcels 
land sales revenues were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal land sales revenues in fiscal included million from the sale of land to the trust 
see note to the financial statements  related party transactions  for a description of the sale to the trust 
land costs as a percentage of land sales revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to higher cost parcels being sold in fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  we expect land sales revenues to be approximately million and land costs to be approximately of the sales value 
equity earnings in unconsolidated entities we are a participant in several joint ventures and in the trust 
we recognize income for our proportionate share of the earnings on sales to unrelated parties from these entities 
see off balance sheet arrangements for a description of our investments in and commitments to these entities 
earnings from these entities vary significantly from year to year 
for fiscal  we recognized million of earnings from these unconsolidated entities as compared to million in fiscal for fiscal  we expect to realize approximately million of earnings from our investments in the joint ventures and in the trust 
interest and other income interest and other income for fiscal was million  a decrease of 
million from the million of interest and other income in fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of a million profit realized from the sale of a small commercial property in fiscal and a decrease in forfeited customer deposits in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  offset  in part  by higher income realized from our ancillary businesses  higher management and construction fee income  and higher interest income 
for fiscal  we expect interest and other income to be approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a in fiscal  sg a spending increased by  or million  as compared to fiscal  while total revenues in fiscal increased by as compared to fiscal the increased spending was principally due to higher sales commissions  higher costs incurred to operate the greater number of selling communities that we had during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and increased compensation and benefit costs 
we expect sg a as a percentage of revenues will be approximately the same in fiscal as in fiscal we expect to open approximately new communities in fiscal as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal expenses related to the early retirement of debt we recognized a pretax charge of million in fiscal representing the premium paid on the early redemption of our senior subordinated notes due  the write off of unamortized bond issuance costs related to those notes  and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs related to our million bank revolving credit agreement that was replaced by a new billion bank revolving credit agreement that expires in july we recognized a pretax charge of million in fiscal representing the premium paid on the early redemption of our senior subordinated notes due  and our senior subordinated notes due  and the write off of unamortized bond issuance costs related to those notes 
fiscal compared to fiscal home sales home sales revenues for fiscal of billion  homes were higher than those of the comparable period of by approximately million  or 
the increase was attributable to an increase in the average price of the homes delivered and an increase in the number of homes delivered 
the increase in the average price of homes delivered in fiscal was the result of increased base selling prices  a shift in the location of homes delivered to more expensive areas and increased expenditures on options and lot premiums by our home buyers 
the increase in the number of homes delivered in fiscal was primarily due to the higher backlog of homes at october  as compared to october  which was primarily the result of a increase in the number of new contracts signed in fiscal over fiscal  and a increase in the number of contracts signed in the first six months of fiscal as compared to the first six months of fiscal the value of new sales contracts signed was billion  homes in fiscal  a increase over the billion  homes value of new sales contracts signed in fiscal the increase in fiscal was attributable to a increase in the number of units sold and a increase in the average selling price of the homes 
the increase in the average selling price in fiscal was attributable to increased base selling prices and increased option and lot premiums selected by our home buyers 
the increase in the number of units sold in fiscal was attributable to the continued demand for our homes and the increased number of communities from which we were selling homes 
we were selling from communities including seven communities that we acquired from richard r 
dostie  inc in september at october   as compared to communities at october  we believe that the demand for our homes was attributable to an increase in the number of affluent households  the maturation of the baby boom generation  a constricted supply of available new home sites in our markets  attractive mortgage rates and the belief of potential customers that the purchase of a home is a stable investment in the current period of economic uncertainty 
at october   we had over  home sites under our control nationwide  as compared to approximately  home sites at october  at october   our backlog of homes under contract was billion  homes  an increase of over the billion  homes backlog at october  the increase in backlog at october   as compared to the backlog at october   was primarily attributable to the increase in the value and number of new contracts signed during fiscal as compared to fiscal  offset  in part  by an increase in the number of homes delivered in fiscal as compared to fiscal home costs as a percentage of home sales revenues decreased slightly in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of selling prices increasing faster than costs 
in addition  we had lower inventory write offs in fiscal than in fiscal we incurred million in write offs in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal land sales we are developing several communities in which we sell a portion of the land to other builders 
the amount of land sales will vary from year to year depending upon the scheduled timing of the delivery of the land parcels 
land sales revenues amounted to million in fiscal  including million from the sale of land to the trust 
see note to the financial statements  related party transactions  for a description of the sale to the trust 
land sales revenues in fiscal amounted to million 
land costs as a percentage of land sales revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to lower cost parcels being sold in fiscal as compared to equity earnings in unconsolidated entities we are a participant in several joint ventures and in the trust 
we recognize income for our proportionate share of the earnings from these entities 
see off balance sheet arrangements for a description of our investments in and commitments to these entities 
earnings from the joint ventures will vary significantly from year to year 
for fiscal  we recognized million of earnings from these unconsolidated entities as compared to million in fiscal interest and other income for fiscal  interest and other income was million  an increase of million as compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of a million profit realized from the sale of a small commercial property in fiscal and higher income realized from our ancillary businesses  offset  in part  by decreases in forfeited customer deposits  lower management and construction fee income and a decrease in gains from the sale of miscellaneous assets 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a in fiscal  sg a spending increased by  or million  as compared to fiscal  whereas revenues in fiscal increased by compared to fiscal the increased spending was principally due to higher sales commissions  higher costs incurred to operate the greater number of selling communities that we had during fiscal as compared to fiscal  increased compensation and benefit costs and higher insurance costs 
expenses related to the early retirement of debt we recognized a pretax charge of million in fiscal representing the premium paid on the early redemption of our senior subordinated notes due and our senior subordinated notes due  and the write off of unamortized bond issuance costs related to those notes 
no similar charge was incurred in fiscal interest expense we determine interest expense on a specific home site by home site basis for our home building operations and on a parcel by parcel basis for land sales 
as a percentage of total revenues  interest expense varies depending upon many factors  including the period of time that we have owned the land  the length of time that the homes delivered during the period were under construction and the interest rates and the amount of debt carried by us in proportion to the amount of our inventory during those periods 
interest expense as a percentage of revenues was slightly lower in fiscal than in fiscal  and slightly lower in fiscal than in fiscal for fiscal  we expect interest expense to be approximately of total revenues 
income before income taxes income before income taxes increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal income taxes income taxes for fiscal  and were provided at effective rates of  and  respectively 
for fiscal  we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 
capital resources and liquidity funding for our operations has been provided principally by cash flow from operating activities  unsecured bank borrowings and the public debt and equity markets 
in general  cash flow from operating activities assumes that as each home is delivered we will purchase a home site to replace it 
because we own several years supply of home sites  we do not need to buy home sites immediately to replace the ones delivered 
accordingly  we believe that cash flow from operating activities before inventory additions is currently a better gauge of liquidity 
cash flow from operating activities  before inventory additions  has improved as operating results have improved 
one of the main factors that determine cash flow from operating activities  before inventory additions  is the level of revenues from the delivery of homes and land sales 
we anticipate that cash flow from operating activities  before inventory additions  will continue to be strong in fiscal due to the expected increase in home deliveries in fiscal  as compared to fiscal we expect that our inventory will continue to increase and we are currently negotiating and searching for additional opportunities to obtain control of land for future communities 
at october   we had commitments to acquire land of approximately billion  of which approximately million had been paid or deposited 
we have used our cash flow from operating activities  before inventory additions  bank borrowings and the proceeds of public debt and equity offerings to acquire additional land for new communities  fund additional expenditures for land development  fund construction costs needed to meet the requirements of our increased backlog and the increasing number of communities in which we are offering homes for sale  repurchase our stock  and repay debt 
we generally do not begin construction of a home until we have a signed contract with the home buyer 
because of the significant amount of time between the time a home buyer enters into a contract to purchase a home and the time that the home is built and delivered  we believe we can estimate  with reasonable accuracy  the number of homes we will deliver in the next to months 
should our business decline significantly  our inventory would decrease as we complete and deliver the homes under construction but do not commence construction of as many new homes  resulting in a temporary increase in our cash flow from operations 
in addition  under such circumstances  we might delay or curtail our acquisition of additional land  which would further reduce our inventory levels and cash needs 
in fiscal  first huntingdon finance corp  one of our indirect  wholly owned subsidiaries  entered into a credit agreement with banks 
this new credit facility replaced our previous facility of million 
the revolving credit facility provides billion of loan capacity and extends through july  at october   interest was payable on borrowings under the facility at subject to adjustment based upon our debt ratings and leverage ratio above the eurodollar rate or other specified variable rates as selected by us from time to time 
at october   we had no borrowings outstanding against the facility  and had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding under it 
in march  toll brothers finance corp  another of our indirect  wholly owned subsidiaries  sold million of senior notes due the obligations of toll brothers finance corp 
to pay principal  premiums if any and interest are guaranteed jointly and severally on a senior basis by us and substantially all of our home building subsidiaries 
the guarantees are full and unconditional 
our non home building subsidiaries did not guarantee the debt 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the senior notes to redeem all of the million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due at of principal amount 
we believe that we will be able to continue to fund our expected growth and meet our contractual obligations through a combination of existing cash resources  cash flow from operating activities  our existing sources of credit and the public debt markets 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our estimated contractual obligations at october  in millions thereafter total senior and senior subordinated notes a   loans payable a warehouse mortgage company loan a operating lease obligations purchase obligations b   retirement plan c a amounts are included in the consolidated balance sheet b amounts represent our commitments to acquire land under options and contracts and the estimated remaining amount of the contractual obligation for land development agreements secured by letters of credit and surety bonds 
c amounts represent our obligations under our k  deferred compensation and supplemental executive retirement plans 
of the total amount indicated  million has been recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
inflation the long term impact of inflation on us is manifested in increased costs for land  land development  construction and overhead  as well as in increased sales prices 
we generally contract for land significantly before development and sales efforts begin 
accordingly  to the extent land acquisition costs are fixed  increases or decreases in the sales prices of homes may affect our profits 
because the sales price of each of our homes is fixed at the time a buyer enters into a contract to acquire a home  and because we generally contract to sell our homes before we begin construction  any inflation of costs in excess of those anticipated may result in lower gross margins 
we generally attempt to minimize that effect by entering into fixed price contracts with our subcontractors and material suppliers for specified periods of time  which generally do not exceed one year 
in general  housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates and housing costs 
interest rates  the length of time that land remains in inventory and the proportion of inventory that is financed affect our interest costs 
if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs  or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  affecting prospective buyers ability to adequately finance home purchases  our revenues  gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 
increases in sales prices  whether the result of inflation or demand  may affect the ability of prospective buyers to afford new homes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates 
we utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument  but not our earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair market value of the debt instrument but do affect our earnings and cash flow 
we do not have the obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on such debt until we are required to refinance such debt 
at october   our debt obligations  principal cash flows by scheduled maturity  weighted average interest rates  and estimated fair value were as follows amounts in thousands variable rate fixed rate debt debt a b weighted weighted average average fiscal year of interest interest expected maturity amount rate amount rate thereafter   discount  total   fair value at october    a we have a billion revolving credit facility with banks which extends through july  at october   interest was payable on borrowings under this facility at this rate will vary based upon our corporate debt rating and leverage ratios above the eurodollar rate or at other specified variable rates as selected by us from time to time 
at october   we had no borrowings and approximately million of letters of credit outstanding under the facility 
b our mortgage subsidiary has a million line of credit with three banks to fund mortgage originations 
the line is due within days of demand by the banks and bears interest at the banks overnight rate plus an agreed upon margin 
at october   the subsidiary had million outstanding under the line at an average interest rate of 
borrowing under this line is included in the fiscal maturities 
based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at october   and holding the variable rate debt balance constant  each increase in interest rates would increase the interest incurred by us by approximately million per year
