the user may select virtually any combination of modules to form an integrated solution for a particular business problem 
the license for such a solution could range from one single module to a multi module  multiple user solution incorporating the full range of our products 
customers frequently require services beyond those provided by our standard support maintenance agreement 
to meet those customers needs  we established a separate professional services division that provides specialized business and software implementation consulting  custom programming  on site installation  system to system interfacing and extensive training 
we provide these services  frequently referred to as systems integration services  for an additional fee normally under a separate contract  based upon time and materials utilized

logility has a number of marketing alliances  including those with ibm and ssa global technologies ssa 
generally  these marketing alliance agreements provide the vendors with non exclusive rights to market our products and access to our marketing materials and product training 
some highlights of these agreements are as follows ibm we entered into an agreement with ibm on march  pursuant to which we modified our supply chain products  with ibm s technical and financial assistance  to operate with ibm s eserver iseries as platform 
also  we agreed to market and support the ibm compatible supply chain products that resulted from our efforts

in exchange  ssa agreed to use all reasonable efforts to promote and sell the software 
this agreement had an original expiration date of april   but is automatically extended for additional one year periods  unless either party terminates the agreement by giving days written notice 
in addition to these marketing alliances  we have developed a network of international agents who assist in selling our products outside the united states 
we intend to utilize these and future relationships with software and service organizations to enhance our sales and marketing position 
these independent distributors and resellers  located in canada  south america  europe and the asia pacific region  distribute our product lines in foreign countries 
these vendors typically sell their own consulting and systems integration services in conjunction with licensing our products 
with the acquisition of demand management  logility gained access to a global distribution channel consisting of organizations with sales  implementation and support resources serving customers in countries

index to financial statements licenses like many business application software firms  software revenue consists principally of fees generated from licensing our software products 
in consideration of the payment of license fees  we typically grant nonexclusive  nontransferable  perpetual licenses  which are primarily business unit  user specific and geographically restricted 
our standard license agreement contains provisions designed to prevent disclosure and unauthorized use of our software 
in these agreements we warrant that our products will function in accordance with the specifications set forth in our product documentation 
the prices for our products are typically functions of the number of modules licensed and the number of servers  users and sites for which the solution is designed and deployed 
customer service and support we provide the following services and support to our customers implementation support we offer our customers a professional and proven implementation program that facilitates rapid implementation of our software products 
our consultants help customers define the nature of their project  and subsequently proceed through the implementation process 
we provide training for all users and managers involved 
we first establish measurable financial and logistical performance indicators  and then evaluate them for conformance during and after implementation 
additional services beyond implementation can include post implementation reviews and benchmarks to further enhance the benefits to customers 
implementation general training services 
we offer our customers post delivery professional services consisting primarily of implementation and training services  for which we typically charge on a daily basis 
customers that purchase implementation services receive assistance in integrating our solution with existing software applications and databases 
implementation of our products typically requires three to nine months  depending on factors such as the complexity of a customer s existing systems  the number of modules purchased  and the number of end users 
product maintenance and updates support services 
we provide our customers with ongoing product support services 
typically  we enter into support or maintenance contracts with customers for an initial one to three year term  billed annually in advance  at the time of the product license with renewal for additional periods thereafter 
under these contracts  we provide telephone consulting  product updates and releases of new versions of products previously purchased by the customer  as well as error reporting and correction services 
we provide ongoing support and maintenance services on a seven day a week  hours a day basis through telephone  electronic mail and web based support  using a call logging and tracking system for quality assurance 
research and development our future success depends in part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products  respond to changing customer requirements  develop and introduce new or enhanced products  and keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards 
we focus our development efforts on several areas  including  but not limited to  enhancing operability of our products across distributed and changing heterogeneous hardware platforms  operating systems and relational databases  and adding functionality to existing products 
these development efforts will continue to focus on deploying applications within a multi tiered erp and supply chain environment  including the internet

as of april   we employed persons in product research  development and enhancement activities 
competition our competitors are diverse and offer a variety of solutions directed at various aspects of the supply chain  as well as the enterprise application market as a whole 
our existing competitors include large enterprise resource planning erp application software vendors such as sap and oracle  which recently acquired peoplesoft jd edwards and retek  each of which offers sophisticated erp solutions that currently  or may in the future  incorporate supply chain management modules  advanced planning and scheduling  warehouse management  transportation or collaboration software  vendors focusing on the supply chain application software market  including but not limited to  vendors such as i technologies  jda software  and manugistics  other business application software vendors that may broaden their product offerings by internally developing  or by acquiring or partnering with independent developers of supply chain management software  and internal development efforts by corporate information technology departments 
in addition  our logility subsidiary may face competition from other application software vendors  including erp vendors that from time to time jointly market logility s products as a complement to their own systems 
to the extent such vendors develop or acquire systems with functionality comparable to logility s products  their significant installed customer base  long standing customer relationships and ability to offer a broad solution could provide a competitive advantage over logility s products 
we also expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the market for collaborative commerce and supply chain management software and new products and technologies are introduced 
in addition  current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
increased competition could result in fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
the principal competitive factors in the target markets in which we compete include product functionality and quality  domain expertise  integration technologies  product suite integration  breadth of products and related services such as customer support  training and implementation services 
other factors important to customers and prospects include customer service and satisfaction  ability to provide relevant customer references

many of our competitors and potential competitors have a broader worldwide presence  longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  greater name recognition  and a larger installed base of customers than we have 
some competitors have become more aggressive with their prices  payment terms and issuance of contractual implementation terms or guarantees 
in order to be successful in the future  we must continue to develop innovative software solutions and respond promptly and effectively to technological change and competitors innovations 
we may also have to lower prices or offer other favorable terms 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products 
we believe that our principal competitive advantages are our comprehensive  integrated solutions  our list of referenceable customers  the ability of our solutions to generate business benefits for our customers  our substantial investment in product development  our deep domain expertise  the ease of use of our software products  our customer support and implementation services  our ability to deploy quickly  and our ability to deliver rapid return on investment for our customers 
proprietary rights and licenses our success and ability to compete are dependent in part upon our proprietary technology 
to protect our proprietary technology  we rely on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions  which may afford only limited protection 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
although we rely on the limited protection afforded by such confidential and contractual procedures and intellectual property laws  we also believe that factors such as the knowledge  ability  and experience of our personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  reliable maintenance and timeliness and quality of support services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position 
we presently have no patents or patent applications pending 
the source code for our proprietary software is protected as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work 
generally copyrights on our products expire years after the year of first publication of each product 
we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and customers  and control access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
in addition  we have registered certain trademarks and have registration applications pending for other trademarks 
we provide our software products to customers under non exclusive license agreements 
as is customary in the software industry  in order to protect our intellectual property rights  we do not sell or transfer title to our products to our customers 
although the license agreements place restrictions on the customer s use of our products  unauthorized use of our products nevertheless may occur 
despite measures we have taken to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to reverse engineer or copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and expensive 
in addition  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in the future  we may increasingly be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
although we are not aware that any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products 
in addition  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
any such claims against us  with or without merit  as well as claims initiated by us against third parties  can be time consuming and expensive to defend  prosecute or resolve 
moreover  an adverse outcome in litigation or similar adversarial proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require the expenditure of significant resources to develop non infringing technology  require a substantial amount of attention from management  require disputed rights to be licensed from others  require us to enter into royalty arrangements or require us to cease the marketing or use of certain products  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
to the extent that we desire or are required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others  there can be no assurance that any such licenses will be made available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
we have relicensed  and expect in the future to relicense  certain software from third parties for use in connection with our products 
there can be no assurance that these third party software vendors will not change their product offerings or that these software licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the termination of any such licenses or product offerings  or the failure of the third party licensors to adequately maintain or update their products  could result in delays in our ability to ship certain of our products while we seek to implement technology offered by alternative sources 
any required replacement licenses could prove costly 
further  any such delay  if it becomes extended  could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations
