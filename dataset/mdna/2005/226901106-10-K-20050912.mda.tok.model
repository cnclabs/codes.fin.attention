critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  sales returns  inventories  and warranty obligations 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the following accounting policies require its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues and the costs of products sold are recognized as the related products are shipped or installed  if there are significant installation costs 
this revenue recognition policy is utilized for shipment of product to customers including both distributors and end users 
revenues for integration contracts where criticare integration acts as an intermediary to supply medical equipment and supplies to medical facilities in countries in the black sea economic zone are recognized on a net basis for services rendered upon completion of the transaction giving rise to the service 
since there was no activity in fiscal or fiscal for these integration services and the activity for fiscal was not material  they are included in the accompanying statement of operations for fiscal as other income

management analyzes specific accounts receivable as well as historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends  foreign currency movements  and changes in its customer payment terms when evaluating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of any of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company also maintains a sales returns reserve in order to estimate potential future product returns related to current period revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demand  and acceptances of the company s products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns reserve 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns reserve in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the timing of the company s revenue if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on the first in  first out method 
the company maintains a reserve for obsolete inventory that it utilizes to write down inventories for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the carrying value of the inventory and the estimated market value 
the company determines the adequacy of the obsolescence reserve by considering historical annual usage of component parts and finished goods as well as assumptions about market conditions and forecasted demand 
when items are physically disposed of the amounts are written off against the reserve 
if future product demand is lower than expected or if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the company  additional charges to increase the obsolescence reserve may be required 
during fiscal  the reserve for obsolete inventory was decreased  to  at june  due mainly to the disposal of obsolete inventory that had been reserved for in prior years 
during fiscal  the reserve for obsolete inventory was decreased  to  at june  due mainly to the disposal of obsolete inventory that had been reserved for in prior years
