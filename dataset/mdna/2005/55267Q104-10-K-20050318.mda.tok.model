the following is a discussion of the accounting policies applied by the company that are considered to involve a higher degree of judgment in their application 
in accordance with sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company s vessels are regularly reviewed for impairment 
the company performs the impairment valuations at the individual vessel level pursuant to paragraph of sfas to consider whether there is an impairment indicator  the company compares the book value and the market value of each vessel at the end of each quarterly reporting period 
at year end  the market value used by the company is equal to the average of the appraisals provided by two leading independent shipbrokers 
appraisals are based on the technical specifications of each vessel  but are not based on a physical inspection of the vessel 
at quarter end  the market values are assessed by the president on the basis of market information  shipping newsletters  sale of comparable vessels reported in the press  informal discussions with shipbrokers or unsolicited proposals received from third parties for the vessels 
whenever a vessel market value is above its book value  the company considers there is no indication of impairment 
whenever a vessel market value is below its book value  the company considers there is a potential impairment and performs a recoverability test 
the company estimates the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the vessel in order to determine if the book value of such vessel is recoverable 
the assumptions used to determine whether the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the vessel exceeds the carrying value involve a considerable degree of judgment on the part of management 
actual results could differ from those estimates  which could have a material effect on the recoverability of the vessels 
the most significant assumptions are the time of final disposal corresponds to the estimated useful life of the vessel years for a container vessel or years for a gas vessel 
these assumptions are identical to the ones used for depreciation purposes 
the estimated value at time of disposal is the estimated scrapping price  calculated as lightweight of the vessel in tons times a certain price per ton  conservatively estimated by management relative to market price 
the projected increase in costs and in revenues is equal to the current inflation rate 
the charter rates used in such computations are estimated by the president on the basis of past historical rates and modulated by his assessment of current and expected future economic and industry trends 
they are subjective as they correspond to the company s best estimate of an average long term rate 
the maintenance of the vessel is estimated at one dry dock every years  alternating intermediate and special survey dry docks  days on hire are estimated at a level consistent with the company s on hire statistics see revenues results of operations management discussion and analysis section 
if the book value of the vessel exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the vessel  the company recognizes an impairment loss equal to the excess of the book value over the market value as defined above 
liquidity and sources of capital liquidity the company had  in cash available on december  as compared to  at december  in addition  on december   deposits totalling  december   were pledged to guarantee the company s performance under the fortis loan agreement 
this  deposit was released by the bank on january  following the prepayment of  under the fortis loan see subsequent events 
it should be noted that  were deposited in vessel operating accounts which are directly operated by the vessel technical managers  in 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities decreased from at december  to at december  the decrease is due for the most part to increase in the current portion of long term debt  following the refinancing of the company s existing debt in october see note long term debt 
investing activities the company did not sell or buy any vessels in operating activities the company generated cash flows from operations of  in compared to  in in  the company dry docked three vessels for a total cost of  in  the company dry docked vessels for a total cost of million 
financing activities the company s long term debt including the current portion decreased from  as of december  to  as of december  during the first months of  the company repaid net borrowings of  these repayments consisted of i  for normal scheduled repayments and ii  for the retirement of  of notes 
on september  the company called the  senior notes still outstanding 
the date fixed for redemption was november  and the redemption price in accordance with the terms of the indenture 
on october   the company entered into a  long term debt agreement with fortis bank in order to refinance all of its outstanding bank debt fortis loan 
the facility bears interest at libor plus and is repayable over six years in equal quarterly instalments 
the borrowers are the existing vessel owning subsidiaries except for the sea river subsidiaries and have granted ship mortgages over their vessels as security 
the company has issued a guarantee in relation to the facility 
the company used the proceeds of this facility as follows  and  to repay the amounts outstanding respectively under the fortis bnp and scotia loans   to buy back the outstanding notes at a premium of and the balance for general corporate purposes 
as a result of the prepayment of its debt  the company recorded a net loss on debt extinguishment of  in the th quarter  corresponding to i the call premium of the million of notes for  ii the write off of the senior notes issuance costs for  and iii the write off of the existing bank debt issuance costs for  as of december   the company s contractual obligations were as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years fortis loan due total guarantees the company has issued a guarantee in relation to the fortis loan see note to the consolidated financial statements in item 
off balance sheet financial arrangements the company had no off balance sheet financial arrangements as of december contingencies in june  the company sold the built container vessel maersk tampa to a non affiliated company with the maersk charter attached 
the buyer had the option to give the vessel back on charter to the company in november for months at a daily rate of  then a second option in november for a period of months at a daily rate of  the first option was not exercised 
the aggregate amount of the company s commitment under the second option is approximately  as follows total these amounts do not take into consideration any revenues the company would earn from chartering out the vessel to another party 
as of march  the current charter rate for twelve month time charter of a vessel similar to the maersk tampa is well in excess of  and the expected revenues from the chartering out of the vessel would cover the expected amount of the commitment 
there is no assurance today  however  as to where market rates will be in november future cash requirements in  the company will have to dry dock four vessels 
management believes that the net cash provided by operating activities will provide sufficient funds to enable the company to meet its liquidity requirements throughout following the sale of four vessels on january  and the release by the bank of the  cash collateral  management believes that the company has excess cash to invest 
the company is in the process of acquiring two vlgcs from the bergesen group of norway for a total consideration of million 
the acquisition will be partially funded with a million loan from scotiabank europe plc 
the company is in the process of acquiring another vlgc in a joint venture with petredec  a leading lpg trading and shipowning company for a total consideration of million

as of december   million out of the million fortis loan were hedged by an interest rate swap until october  after such date and until its final maturity in october  the facility will bear interest at libor plus 
impact of currency fluctuations the company s functional currency is the us dollar  however  a number of trade transactions related to normal vessel operations are performed in other currencies 
trade payables and accrued expenses as well as cash and trade receivables in foreign currencies are converted at year end exchange rates and therefore recorded at fair value 
the company does not hold any other assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
