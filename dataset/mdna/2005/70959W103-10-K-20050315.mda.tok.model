item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we are a holding company whose assets consist primarily of the direct or indirect ownership of the capital stock of our operating subsidiaries 
consequently  our ability to pay dividends is dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute earnings and other advances and payments to us 
also  pursuant to the automobile franchise agreements to which our dealerships are subject  all dealerships are required to maintain a certain amount of working capital  which could limit our subsidiaries ability to pay us dividends

overview we are the second largest automotive retailer in the united states as measured by total revenues 
as of march   we owned and operated franchises in the united states and franchises internationally  primarily in the united kingdom 
we offer a full range of vehicle brands  however  of our revenues in came from the combined sales of foreign and luxury brands such as toyota  honda  bmw  lexus and mercedes 
in  luxury brands represented of our revenues 
in addition to selling new and used vehicles  we generate higher margin revenue at each of our dealerships through maintenance and repair services  and we facilitate the sale of third party finance and insurance products  third party extended service contracts and replacement and aftermarket automotive products 
new vehicle revenues include sales to retail customers and to leasing companies providing consumer automobile leasing 
used vehicle revenues include amounts received for used vehicles sold to retail customers  leasing companies providing consumer automobile leasing and other dealers 
we generate finance and insurance revenues from sales of third party extended service contracts and other third party insurance policies  as well as from fees for facilitating the sale of third party finance and lease contracts and certain other services 
service and parts revenues include fees paid for repair and maintenance service  the sale of replacement parts  the sale of aftermarket accessories and collision repairs 
we and sirius satellite radio inc have agreed to jointly promote sirius satellite radio service where available  in vehicles sold at our dealerships through january these joint promotional activities include ordering or installing sirius radios in selected vehicles  selling bundled subscriptions to the sirius service and other efforts to promote sirius 
sirius has agreed to share in the cost of these efforts in part by issuing us compensation in the form of warrants to purchase sirius common stock 
we have received the right to earn twenty million warrants to purchase shares of sirius satellite radio common stock at per share 
these warrants are earned based on the attainment of certain performance targets and joint promotional efforts 
the warrants may be cancelled if these performance targets are not met or upon the termination of our agreement 
the value of sirius stock has been and is expected to be subject to significant fluctuations  which may result in variability in the amount we earn under this arrangement 
we may not be able to achieve any performance targets outlined in the warrants 
our gross profit tends to vary with the mix of revenues we derive from the sale of new vehicles  used vehicles  finance and insurance products  and service and parts services 
our gross profit generally varies across product lines  with vehicle sales usually resulting in lower gross profit margins and our other sales resulting in higher gross profit margins 
factors such as seasonality  weather  cyclicality and manufacturers advertising and incentives may impact the mix of our revenues  and therefore influence our gross profit margin 
our selling expenses consist of advertising and compensation for sales personnel  including commissions and related bonuses 
general and administrative expenses include compensation for administration  finance  legal and general management personnel  rent  insurance  utilities and other outside services 
a significant portion of our selling expenses are variable  and a significant portion of our general and administrative expenses are subject to our control  allowing us to adjust them over time to reflect economic trends 
floor plan interest expense relates to indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition of new and used vehicle inventories 
other interest expense consists of interest charges on all of our interest bearing debt  other than interest relating to floor plan financing 
we have acquired a number of dealerships each year since our inception 
each of these acquisitions has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
as a result  our financial statements include the results of operations of the acquired dealerships from the date of acquisition 

table of contents the future success of our business will likely be dependent on  among other things  our ability to consummate and integrate acquisitions  our ability to increase sales of higher margin products  especially service and parts services  our ability to realize returns on our significant capital investment in new and upgraded dealerships  and the success of our international operations

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the application of accounting policies that often involve making estimates and employing judgment 
such judgments influence the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses in our financial statements 
management  on an ongoing basis  reviews these estimates and assumptions 
management may determine that modifications in assumptions and estimates are required  which may result in a material change in our results of operations or financial position 
following are the accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements that management believes are most dependent upon the use of estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition vehicle  parts and service sales we record revenue when vehicles are delivered and title has passed to the customer  when vehicle service or repair work is performed and when parts are delivered to our customers 
sales promotions that we offer to customers are accounted for as a reduction of sales at the time of sale 
rebates and other incentives offered directly to us by manufacturers are recognized as earned 
finance and insurance sales we arrange financing for customers through various financial institutions and receive a commission from the lender equal to either the difference between the interest rates charged to customers and the interest rates set by the financing institution or a flat fee 
we also receive commissions for facilitating the sale of various third party insurance products to customers  including credit and life insurance policies and extended service contracts 
these commissions are recorded as revenue at the time the customer enters into the contract 
we are not the obligor under any of these contracts 
in the case of finance contracts  a customer may prepay or fail to pay their contract  thereby terminating the contract 
customers may also terminate extended service contracts  which are fully paid at purchase  and become eligible for refunds of unused premiums 
in these circumstances  a portion of the commissions we receive may be charged back to us based on the relevant terms of the contracts 
the revenue we record relating to commissions is net of an estimate of the ultimate amount of chargebacks we will be required to pay 
such estimate of chargeback exposure is based on our historical chargeback experience arising from similar contracts  including the impact of refinance and default rates on retail finance contracts and cancellation rates on extended service contracts and other insurance products 
intangible assets our principal intangible assets relate to our franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers  which represent the estimated value of franchises acquired in business combinations consummated subsequent to july   and goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of tangible and identified intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we believe the franchise value of our dealerships have an indefinite life based on the following facts automotive retailing is a mature industry and is based on franchise agreements with the vehicle manufacturers  there are no known changes or events that would alter the automotive retailing franchise environment  certain franchise agreement terms are indefinite  
table of contents franchise agreements that have limited terms have historically been renewed without substantial cost  our history shows that manufacturers have not terminated franchise agreements 
impairment testing intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis 
franchise value impairment is assessed through a comparison of an estimate of its fair value with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of a franchise exceeds its estimated fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we also evaluate the remaining useful life of our franchises in connection with the annual impairment testing to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
goodwill impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level 
we have three regions  each of which as been determined to be a reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is determined to exceed its estimated fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
investments investments include marketable securities and investments in businesses accounted for under the equity method 
marketable securities include investments in debt and equity securities 
marketable securities held by us are typically classified as available for sale and are stated at fair value in our balance sheet with unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income  a separate component of stockholders equity 
declines in investment values that are deemed to be other than temporary would result in an impairment charge reducing the investments carrying value to fair value 
a majority of our investments are in joint venture relationships that are more fully described in joint venture relationships in this management s discussion and analysis 
such joint venture relationships are accounted for under the equity method  pursuant to which we record our proportionate share of the joint venture s income each period 
self insurance we retain risk relating to certain of our general liability insurance  workers compensation insurance and employee medical benefits in the united states 
as a result  we are likely to be responsible for a majority of the claims and losses incurred under these programs 
the amount of risk we retain varies by program  but we typically pay per occurrence deductibles and  for certain exposures  have pre determined maximum exposure limits for each insurance period 
the majority of losses  if any  above the pre determined exposure limits are typically paid by third party insurance carriers 
our estimate of future losses is prepared by management using our historical loss experience and industry based development factors 
income taxes tax regulations may require items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses which are not deductible on our tax return  and some are timing differences  such as the timing of depreciation expense 
timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax effect in our financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent expenses recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred or deductions taken on our tax return which have not yet been recognized as expense in our financial statements 
we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to allow for the use of the deduction or credit

table of contents employee services  establishes accounting standards for equity instruments that an entity exchanges for goods or services and addresses transactions where an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
sfas no 
r will require us to expense the grant date fair value of equity compensation awards over their vesting period

liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements are primarily for working capital  inventory financing  the acquisition of new dealerships  the improvement and expansion of existing facilities  the construction of new facilities and dividends 
historically  these cash requirements have been met through cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit agreements including floor plan arrangements  the issuance of debt securities  sale leaseback transactions and the issuance of equity securities 
as of december   we had working capital of million  including million of cash  available to fund operations and future acquisitions 
in addition  we had million and million million available for borrowing under our us credit agreement and our us credit agreement  respectively  which are each discussed below 
we paid cash dividends on our common stock on december  and march   each in the amount of eleven cents per share 
future quarterly or other cash dividends will depend upon our earnings  capital requirements  financial condition  restrictions on any then existing indebtedness and other factors considered relevant by our board of directors 
our principal source of growth has come from acquisitions of automotive dealerships 
we believe that our cash flow from operating activities and our existing capital resources  including the liquidity provided by our credit agreements and floor plan financing arrangements  will be sufficient to fund our operations and commitments for the next twelve months 
to the extent we pursue additional significant acquisitions  we may need to raise additional capital either through the public or private issuance of equity or debt securities or through additional bank borrowings 
we may not have sufficient availability under our credit agreements to finance significant additional acquisitions

other financing arrangements in the past  we have entered into sale leaseback transactions to finance certain property acquisitions and capital expenditures  pursuant to which we sell property and leasehold improvements to a third party and agree to lease those assets back for a certain period of time

cyclicality unit sales of motor vehicles  particularly new vehicles  historically have been cyclical  fluctuating with general economic cycles 
during economic downturns  the automotive retailing industry tends to experience similar periods of decline and recession as the general economy 
we believe that the industry is influenced by general economic conditions and particularly by consumer confidence  the level of personal discretionary spending  fuel prices  interest rates and credit availability 
seasonality our business is modestly seasonal overall 
our us operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales in the second and third quarters of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models 
also  demand for cars and light trucks is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons  particularly in regions of the united states where dealerships may be subject to 
table of contents severe winters 
the greatest us seasonalities exist at the dealerships we operate in northeastern and upper mid western states  for which the second and third quarters are the strongest with respect to vehicle related sales 
our uk operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales in the first and third quarters of each year  due primarily to vehicle registration practices in the uk the service and parts business at all dealerships experiences relatively modest seasonal fluctuations 
effects of inflation we believe that inflation rates over the last few years have not had a significant impact on revenues or profitability 
we do not expect inflation to have any near term material effects on the sale of our products and services 
however  there can be no assurance that there will be no such effect in the future 
we finance substantially all of our inventory through various revolving floor plan arrangements with interest rates that vary based on the prime rate or libor 
such rates have historically increased during periods of increasing inflation 
we do not believe that we would be placed at a competitive disadvantage should interest rates increase due to increased inflation since most other automotive dealerships have similar floating rate borrowing arrangements

forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are not assurances of future performance 
actual results may differ materially from anticipated results due to a variety of factors  including the factors identified in our filings with the sec 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include the following the ability of automobile manufacturers to exercise significant control over our operations  since we depend on them in order to operate our business  because we depend on the success and popularity of the brands we sell  adverse conditions affecting one or more automobile manufacturers may negatively impact our revenues and profitability  
table of contents if we are unable to complete additional acquisitions or successfully integrate acquisitions  we may not be able to achieve desired results from our acquisition strategy  we may not be able to satisfy our capital requirements for making acquisitions  dealership renovation projects or financing the purchase of our inventory  our failure to meet a manufacturer s consumer satisfaction requirements may adversely affect our ability to acquire new dealerships  our ability to obtain incentive payments from manufacturers and our profitability  automobile manufacturers may impose limits on our ability to issue additional equity and on the ownership of our common stock by third parties  which may hamper our ability to meet our financing needs  our business and the automotive retail industry in general are susceptible to adverse economic conditions  including changes in interest rates  consumer confidence  fuel prices and credit availability  substantial competition in automotive sales and services may adversely affect our profitability  if we lose key personnel  especially our chief executive officer  or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel  our business could be adversely affected  our quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to seasonality in the automotive retail business and other factors  because most customers finance the cost of purchasing a vehicle  increased interest rates may adversely affect our vehicle sales  our business may be adversely affected by import product restrictions and foreign trade risks that may impair our ability to sell foreign vehicles profitably  our automobile dealerships are subject to substantial regulation which may adversely affect our profitability  if state dealer laws in the united states are repealed or weakened  our automotive dealerships may be subject to increased competition and may be more susceptible to termination  non renewal or renegotiation of their franchise agreements  our automotive dealerships are subject to foreign  federal  state and local environmental regulations that may result in claims and liabilities  our dealership operations may be affected by severe weather or other periodic business interruptions  our principal stockholders have substantial influence over us and may make decisions with which other stockholders may disagree  some of our directors and officers may have conflicts of interest with respect to certain related party transactions and other business interests  our level of indebtedness may limit our ability to obtain financing for acquisitions and may require that a significant portion of our cash flow be used for debt service  due to the nature of the automotive retailing business  we may be involved in legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our business  our overseas operations subject our profitability to fluctuations relating to changes in foreign currency valuations  and we are a holding company and as a result rely on the receipt of payments from our subsidiaries in order to meet our cash needs and service our indebtedness 

table of contents furthermore  the price of our common stock is subject to substantial fluctuation  which may be unrelated to our performance  and shares eligible for future sale may cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly  even if our business is doing well 
we urge you to carefully consider these risk factors in evaluating all forward looking statements regarding our business 
readers of this report are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained in this report 
all forward looking statements attributable to us are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in the interest rates on a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness 
outstanding balances under our us and us credit agreements bear interest at a variable rate based on a margin over libor  as defined 
based on the amount outstanding as of december   a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change to our annual interest expense 
similarly  amounts outstanding under floor plan financing arrangements bear interest at a variable rate based on a margin over defined libor or prime rate 
we continually evaluate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and follow established policies and procedures to implement strategies designed to manage the amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding at any point in time in an effort to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our earnings and cash flows 
we are currently party to a swap agreement pursuant to which a notional million of our floating rate floor plan debt was exchanged for fixed rate debt through january based on an average of the aggregate amounts outstanding under our floor plan financing arrangements subject to variable interest payments  a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change to our annual interest expense 
interest rate fluctuations affect the fair market value of our fixed rate debt  including the notes and certain seller financed promissory notes  but  with respect to such fixed rate instruments  do not impact our earnings or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rates 
as of december   we have invested in franchised dealership operations in the uk  germany  brazil and mexico 
in each of these markets  the local currency is the functional currency 
due to the company s intent to remain permanently invested in these foreign markets  we do not hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
other than the uk  the company s foreign operations are not significant 
in the event we change our intent with respect to the investment in any of our international operations  we would expect to implement strategies designed to manage those risks in an effort to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our earnings and cash flows 
in common with other automotive retailers  we purchase certain of our new vehicle and parts inventories from foreign manufacturers 
although we purchase the majority of our inventories in the local functional currency  our business is subject to certain risks  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility which may influence such manufacturers ability to provide their products at competitive prices in the local jurisdictions 
our future results could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors
