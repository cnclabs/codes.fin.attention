item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation except for the historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from those described below  including those risks described in the section entitled  business risk factors  and elsewhere in this annual report 
our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operation of document sciences and its subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  computer software costs  goodwill  allowance for doubtful accounts and valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from our estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
initial license fees are recognized when a contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  software delivery has occurred and collection of the receivable is deemed probable 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue for all of our license models 
our contracts specifically state the amount of initial and annual license fees due for each type of software licensed 
if an undelivered element of the arrangement exists under the license arrangement  revenue is deferred based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  all revenue is deferred until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
we recognize revenue on transactions with payment terms less than twelve months from the contract date  if we have a history of successfully collecting from the specific customer without providing concessions 
amounts billed or payments received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
revenues generated from consulting services are recognized as the related services are performed and collectibility is deemed probable 
however  when such consulting services are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the delivered software product  revenue from the entire arrangement is recognized on a percentage of completion method or not until the contract is completed in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and accounting research bulletin arb no 
 long term construction type contracts 
we measure progress under the percentage of completion method  depending on how the contract language is written  either by using the percentage of total project hours completed or by the completion of phases in the consulting project 
because i the phases of our consulting projects are generally not of great duration weeks on average and ii we have a variety of projects progressing at the same time  we believe that there are very limited circumstances where materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
software development costs 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and significant enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility of the product has been established 
after technological feasibility has been established  direct production costs  including programming and testing  are capitalized until general release of the product 
capitalized costs of software to be sold  licensed or otherwise marketed are amortized using the greater of the amount computed using the ratio of current period product revenues to estimated total product revenues or the 
table of contents straight line method over the remaining estimated economic lives of the products 
it is possible that estimated total product revenues  the estimated economic life of the product  or both  will be reduced in the future 
as a result  the carrying amount of capitalized software costs may be reduced in the future  which could cause our operating results in future periods to be adversely affected 
impairment of goodwill 
the value of our goodwill could be impacted by future adverse changes such as declines in our operating results or failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results 
we evaluate these assets on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
in the process of our annual impairment review  we primarily use a discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of our assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
it is possible  however  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur impairment charges 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  which would result in an additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination is made 
at the end of each reporting period  we perform a detailed review of outstanding balances by customer and invoice 
we utilize statistical and account specific analysis to determine the adequacy of our reserve  as well as comparing balances to historical losses 
if our assumptions or analysis are incorrect  our operating results for future periods may be adversely affected 
deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
due to the uncertainty of realizing a portion of these net deferred tax assets  we have maintained a valuation allowance of million for net deferred tax assets 
such uncertainty primarily relates to the potential for future taxable income as well as loss carryforwards and tax credits expiring in and  respectively 
in addition  pursuant to sections and of the internal revenue code  annual use of our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of more than within a three year period 
no valuation allowance has been recorded to offset the remaining  of net deferred tax assets as we have determined that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized within the next twelve months 
we will continue to assess the likelihood of realization of such assets  however  if future events occur which do not make the realization of such assets more likely than not  we will record a valuation allowance against all or a portion of the remaining net deferred tax assets 
examples of future events that might occur which would make the realization of such assets not likely is a lack of taxable income resulting from poor operating results during as a result of our assessment at december   our valuation allowance remained at  results of operations for the years ended december   and the following table shows the percentage of revenues  cost of revenues  operating expenses and other items to total revenues in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated years ended december  revenues initial license fees annual renewal license and support fees services and other total revenues cost of revenues initial license fees annual renewal license and support fees services and other total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss 
table of contents revenues our revenues are divided into three categories based upon the sources from which they are derived initial license fees  annual renewal license and support fees  and services and other revenues 
the following discussion is separated into these categories 
we sell our products principally through our direct sales force domestically and through distributors and vars internationally 
the following table summarizes revenues in thousands and the percentage change over the previous year for the periods indicated years ended december  initial license fees annual renewal license and support fees services and other total revenues initial license fees 
initial license fees consist primarily of upfront license fees for the first year of use of our products 
the components of initial license fees in thousands of our product families consist of the following years ended december  products compuset xpression document library services document viewing services total initial license fees the increase in initial license fees in is primarily due to higher sales in the united states and improved product sales of xpression 
throughout and  we addressed the difficulties we had faced with our initial launch of xpression in the fourth quarter of with the release of xpression  we have a more stable product and better features 
with this release and better customer references  we were able to increase xpression license fees by over million 
the decrease in initial license fees in was due to the impact of transitioning our marketing and sales effort from one based exclusively on our existing autogragh suite to one focused largely around xpression 
however  sales of our enterprise wide xpression product line often involve more participants in the corporate decision making process than sales of our autograph suite 
we experienced quality issues and installation problems on the introduction of our xpression product line 
as a result of these factors  we had difficulties in generating customer references  which are typically required in the industries into which we sell 
in this regard  sales of xpression had been less successful than planned due to transition difficulties  as well as the weak state of the overall economy and the related effect on corporate buying decisions 

table of contents annual renewal license and support fees 
annual renewal license and support fees consist of license fees for the initial and continued use and support of our licensed products 
the increases in and were due to increases in our base of licensed software users and in our list prices 
services and other 
services and other revenues consist of fees for consulting  application development and training services performed by us as well as miscellaneous other operational revenues 
the increase in was largely due to increases in consulting services resulting from our purchase of objectiva 
cost of revenues the following table summarizes cost of revenues in thousands and the percentage change over the previous year for the periods indicated years ended december  initial license fees annual renewal license and support fees services and other total cost of revenues cost of initial license fees 
cost of initial license fees includes amortization of previously capitalized software development costs  costs of third party software  employment costs for distribution personnel and product packaging 
the increase in was primarily the result of higher sales and an increase in the amortization of software due to the general release of xpression the decrease in was primarily the result of lower sales and a decrease in the amortization of software due to full amortization of autograph products 
cost of annual renewal license and support fees 
costs of annual renewal license fees consist principally of the employment related costs for our technical support staff 
the increases in and were due to increases in staff to support a growing product set 
cost of services and other 
costs of services and other consist principally of the employment related costs of our consulting and training staff 
the increase in was due to an increase in staff to support our higher services revenues and from our purchase of objectiva 
the increase in was due to unbillable time related to the support of  and personnel training in  the use of xpression 
operating expenses the following table summarizes operating expenses in thousands and the percentage change over the previous year for the periods indicated years ended december  research and development selling and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of the employment related costs of personnel associated with developing new products  enhancing existing products  testing software products and developing product documentation 
we anticipate that we will continue to direct significant resources to the development and enhancement of our products 

table of contents the following table shows the breakout of research and development capitalized software development costs in thousands and the percentage change over the previous year for the periods indicated years ended december  research and development net capitalized software development costs research and development gross capitalized software development costs mainly include payroll related costs of our engineering resources and consulting fees paid to objectiva in relation to the development of xpression 
we expect the amount of capitalized software development costs to be less in because we expect a decrease in the time between the establishment of technological feasibility and general releases of our products 
the increase in capitalized software development costs in was due to the amount of time between the establishment of technological feasibility and the general release of xpression the increase in capitalized software development costs in was due to additional resources working on xpression 
our gross development costs in declined because the costs to conduct development efforts in china became less expensive once resources changed from outside consultants to internal employees following our objectiva acquisition 
the decrease in gross development costs in was primarily due to a  decrease in allocated facility and communication costs   decrease in personnel costs and a  decrease in expenditures for outside consultants 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  marketing programs and related costs for pre and post sales activity 
the decrease in was primarily due to a  decrease in travel expenses and a  decrease in trade shows and advertising offset by a  increase in commissions and a  increase in outside consultants 
the increase in was primarily due to a  increase in personnel costs in support of the release of xpression and a  increase in outside sales contractors 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of employment related costs for finance  administration  it and human resources  allowance for doubtful accounts and general corporate management expenses  including legal and audit fees 
not withstanding the  provision for a european value added tax assessment we accrued in  general and administrative expenses increased over this increase was primarily due to a  increase in personnel costs due to a reclassification in of certain personnel from other departments 
the increase in was primarily due to a  provision for a european value added tax assessment and a  increase in professional fees offset by a  decrease in allocated facility and communication costs 
other items interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net is composed of interest income from cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  offset by interest expense related to capital leases and notes to xerox and losses on disposals of fixed assets 
interest and other income  net were   and  in  and  respectively 
the decreases in and were the result of less interest income due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the  provision for income taxes in was due to foreign taxes 
in  we reserved  of the previously released  of our recorded valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets 
the remaining  provision for income taxes in was due to foreign taxes 
we will continue to assess the likelihood of realization of our net deferred tax assets 
if future events occur that do not make the realization of such assets more likely than not  a valuation allowance will be established against all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets 
trends and factors that may affect future operating results our total revenues and operating results can vary  sometimes substantially  from quarter to quarter and are expected to vary significantly in the future 
our revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast 
future results will depend upon many factors  including the demand for our products  the level of product and price competition  the length of our sales cycle  the size and timing of individual license transactions  the delay or deferral of customer implementations  the budget cycles of our customers  our success in expanding our direct sales force and indirect distribution channels  the timing of new product introductions and product enhancements by us and our competitors  the mix of products and services sold  levels of international sales  activities of and acquisitions by competitors  the 
table of contents timing of new hires  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  our ability to develop and market new products  controlling costs and general domestic and international economic conditions 
in addition  our sales generally reflect a relatively high amount of revenue per order  and  therefore  the loss or delay of individual orders could have a significant impact on our revenues and quarterly operating results 
in addition  a significant amount of our revenues occur predominantly in the third month of each fiscal quarter and tend to be concentrated in the latter half of that third month 
our software products generally are shipped as orders are received 
as a result  initial license fees in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
the timing of receipt of initial license fees is difficult to predict because of the length of our sales cycle 
for autograph products  our sales cycle is typically three to nine months from initial contact 
for xpression products  our sales cycle is typically six months to over one year from initial contact 
because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue trends and because a high percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in the recognition of revenue from a limited number of initial license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in losses 
to the extent such expenses precede  or are not subsequently followed by  increased revenues  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
due to the foregoing factors  revenues and operating results for any quarter are subject to significant variation  and we believe that period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of cash come mainly from operations and sales and maturities of short term investments 
our main uses of cash are for payroll 
our main project underway is a maintenance program  xpression we intend to release in the st quarter of we currently do not have any debt from borrowed money 
our short term investments are invested in us government agency obligations 
we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures at least through the next twelve months 
in this regard  a portion of our cash could be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
we have no material current understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisition in whole of other businesses  products or technologies 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
this is an increase of  from december  this is primarily due to net income of  and an increase of million in deferred revenue offset by payments of million for software development costs 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and  we did not have any other relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following information as of december  is shown with respect to known contractual obligations for the periods specified below 
payment due by period totals less than year years years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations totals

 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas r using a modified prospective application 
under modified prospective application  sfas r  which provides certain changes to the method for valuing stock based compensation among other changes  will apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and are subsequently modified or cancelled 
compensation expense for outstanding awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under sfas we are in the process of determining how the new method of valuing stock based compensation as prescribed in sfas r will be applied to valuing stock based awards granted after the effective date and the impact the recognition of compensation expense related to such awards will have on its financial statements 
sfas r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt sfas r on july  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to a certain extent  foreign currency exchange rate movements also affect our competitive position  as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and or pricing strategies on non us based competitors 
our primary foreign currency risk exposure is related to us dollar to euro conversions 
our subsidiary in china conducts business primarily in the chinese yuan 
currently  the chinese yuan is tied to the us dollar at a rate of to considering the anticipated cash flows from firm sales commitments and anticipated sales for the next quarter  a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar relative to the euro would not materially adversely affect expected first quarter earnings or cash flows 
this analysis is dependent on actual export sales during the next quarter occurring within of budgeted forecasts 
the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the affect this movement may have on other variables including competitive risk 
if it were possible to quantify this competitive impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects described above 
each month  we review our position for expected currency exchange rate movements 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our short term available for sale investments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december  declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income
