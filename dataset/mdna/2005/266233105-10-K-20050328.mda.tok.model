the net income impact to the electricity delivery segment was million of lower earnings as compared to 
table of contents although duquesne light began operating under its polr ii arrangement described below in  only six rate classes became subject to the polr ii arrangement during all remaining rate classes but one became subject to polr ii in  which was the primary reason for the million increase in earnings in from the electricity supply business segment 
other income was million lower in  primarily due to a million reduction in interest earnings 
the net impact to the electricity delivery segment was a reduction to earnings of million as compared to the increase in earnings from continuing operations at holdings was also affected by the following earnings from dqe financial increased million  primarily as a result of million of after tax investment and asset impairment charges recorded in  and an after tax gain of million in as a result of the sale of its limited partnership investment in a natural gas operating partnership

 goodwill and other intangible assets  was recorded as of january  see note results of operations by business segment compared to electricity delivery business segment 
the electricity delivery business segment reported million of earnings in  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily due to higher revenue and lower interest and other charges  partially offset by higher operating expenses in operating revenues are primarily derived from the delivery of electricity  including related excise taxes 
sales to residential and commercial customers are primarily influenced by weather conditions 
warmer summer and colder winter seasons lead to increased customer use of electricity for cooling and heating 
commercial sales also are affected by regional development 
sales to industrial customers are influenced by national and global economic and competitive conditions 
operating revenues increased by million  or  compared to the increase is primarily due to a increase in megawatt hours mwh sales from residential and commercial sales increased compared to  as the effect of the hotter summer and the extra day due to leap year in more than offset the warmer winter 
the following table sets forth mwh delivered to electric utility customers 
mwh delivered in thousands change residential commercial industrial 
table of contents operating expenses are primarily made up of costs to operate and maintain the transmission and distribution system  meter reading  billing and collection costs  customer service  administrative expenses  and non income taxes  such as gross receipts  property and payroll taxes 
in  we recognized a million charge related to vacant leased office space 
operating expenses increased by million  or  compared to million after considering the lease charge 
reasons for this increase include a million increase in labor  pension and other fringe benefit costs  a million increase in insurance costs  and a million increase in billing and collection costs 
interest and other charges include interest on long term debt  other interest and preferred stock dividends of duquesne light 
interest and other charges decreased million  or  due to i million of debt retirements in late  which reduced interest expense by million  and ii million of subordinated debenture redemptions in the first six months of  which reduced interest expense million 
these reductions more than offset the million increase in interest expense resulting from the issuance of million of debt in may  and the million increase in dividends resulting from the issuance of million of preferred stock in april electricity supply business segment 
in  the electricity supply business segment reported earnings of million  compared with million in the decrease of million  or  is primarily due to the million after tax charge million pre tax incurred by duquesne power related to the termination of the sunbury acquisition 
operating revenues are derived primarily from the supply of electricity for delivery to retail customers and  to a much lesser extent  the supply of electricity to wholesale customers 
retail energy requirements fluctuate as the number of customers participating in customer choice and their use of electricity changes  an increase or decline in polr mwh supplied will cause a corresponding change in total revenues and operating expenses 
energy requirements for residential and commercial customers are also influenced by weather conditions  temperature extremes lead to increased customer use of electricity for cooling and heating 
commercial energy requirements are also affected by regional development 
energy requirements of industrial customers are primarily influenced by national and global economic conditions 
short term sales to other utilities are made at market rates 
these sales result primarily from excess daily energy deliveries to duquesne light s electricity delivery system 
operating revenues decreased million  or  compared to  due to the decline in polr mwh 
the decline resulted from a higher percentage of our commercial and industrial customers choosing alternative generation suppliers 
the following tables set forth mwh supplied for polr customers 
mwh supplied in thousands polr i polr ii total residential commercial industrial polr retention mwh basis mwh supplied in thousands polr i polr ii total residential commercial industrial polr retention mwh basis operating expenses consist of costs to obtain energy for our polr service  gross receipts tax and  beginning in the third quarter of  costs related to duquesne power 
operating expenses decreased million  or  compared to  primarily due to an million decrease in purchased power expense 
this decrease was caused by the decline in the polr mwh supplied to customers 
ctc business segment 
for the ctc business segment  operating revenues are derived by billing electric delivery customers for generation related transition costs 
duquesne light is allowed to earn an pre tax return on the net of tax ctc balance 
as revenues are billed to customers on a monthly basis  we amortize the ctc balance 
the resulting decrease in the ctc balance causes a decline in the return earned by duquesne light 
the ctc balance has been fully collected from all but one customer class  which consists of two large industrial customers 
the ctc business segment reported earnings of million in  compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 

table of contents energy solutions business segment 
the energy solutions business segment reported earnings of million in  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
the results were positively impacted by reductions in incentive compensation costs paid to former executives of this subsidiary 
operating revenues for this segment are derived primarily from the facility management services for industrial  airport and synthetic fuel customers

excluding the restructuring charge  income from the electricity delivery business segment was million  or  lower in  primarily due to lower operating revenues and other income in operating revenues decreased by million  or  compared to the decrease is primarily due to a decline in megawatt hours mwh delivered in  which resulted in a million decline in revenue 
residential and commercial sales decreased and  compared to reduced air conditioning loads during the cooler summer more than offset increased heating use during pittsburgh s colder winter in industrial sales  which are less sensitive to weather  also decreased by  due to lower sales to industrial customers in the durable goods manufacturing sector 
the following table sets forth mwh delivered to electric utility customers 
mwh delivered in thousands change residential commercial industrial in addition  revenue declined million due to lower revenue recovery of taxes other than income taxes through the state tax adjustment surcharge stas as compared to operating expenses increased by million  or  compared to in  pension expense increased million  and we recognized a million pre tax charge related to vacant leased office space 
these significant increases in expense were partially offset by a million reduction in the gross receipts tax expense recognized  due to the reduction in the revenue recovery of this item through the stas 
costs allocated from duquesne light to its affiliates increased million from  which reduced the net expenses at duquesne light 
in addition  compared to  savings of at least million in each of the following areas were achieved bad debt  legal and meter reading

electricity supply business segment 
during the first quarter of  duquesne light began operating under polr ii  which extended the polr service and the puc approved rates for the supply of electricity beyond the final ctc collection through december  polr ii also permitted duquesne light  following ctc collection for each rate class  a margin per mwh supplied 
the actual margin earned depended on the mix of rate classes and the number of customers participating in polr ii 
prior to the start of the polr ii arrangement  polr i was designed to be income neutral 
in  the electricity supply business segment reported earnings of million  compared with earnings of million in the increase of million  or  was primarily due to all significant rate classes being subject to the polr ii arrangement for all of in contrast  during  these classes became subject to the polr ii arrangement at different times  as their ctc was fully collected 
operating revenues decreased million  or  compared to the decrease is due to commercial and industrial customers shopping for their generation supply  causing a decline in the percentage of customer load delivered through our polr arrangements 
the revenue decline attributable to shopping was partially mitigated by the increase in polr ii mwh supplied  for which a higher rate applied

energy solutions business segment 
the energy solutions business segment reported earnings of million in  compared to earnings of million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase resulted primarily from higher earnings at the energy facilities as well as a full year of income from a new synthetic fuel facility management services contract that commenced in the fourth quarter of operating revenues increased million  or  compared to this increase was principally due to higher synthetic fuel production related to the new services contract discussed above 
operating expenses increased million  or  compared to  primarily due to higher employee compensation costs and additional operating expenses associated with the new services contract

absent the impairment charges  earnings increased million  or 
this increase resulted primarily from a million after tax gain on the sale of an investment in a natural gas operating partnership  higher earnings due to higher sales prices for landfill gas and million of increased earnings from the synthetic fuel investment 
operating revenues increased million  or  compared to this increase was primarily due to higher sales prices for pipeline quality landfill gas  which increased  as the pipeline quality production volume remained relatively consistent between the years 
operating expenses increased million  or  compared to expenses related to our synthetic fuel investment increased million from due to higher production volumes in  while general corporate overhead expenses decreased million and landfill related costs decreased million 
depreciation and amortization expense consists of the depreciation of landfill gas equipment and gas rights 
the decrease of million  or  compared to  was primarily due to the write off of the fresh kills landfill gas investment as of december  other income increased million  or  as compared to  primarily due to a pre tax gain of million on the sale of the limited partnership investment previously discussed 
this gain was partially offset by a million scheduled decline in earnings from structured lease investments 
our income tax benefit decreased million or from  primarily due to the increase in our pre tax earnings  which caused a corresponding change in our provision for federal income taxes

interest and other charges include interest on long term debt  other interest  and  effective july   dividends on holdings preferred stock 
interest expense decreased million  or  compared to this decrease was primarily due to lower intercompany loan balances in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions with respect to values and conditions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements 
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period also may be affected by the estimates and assumptions we are required to make 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  using historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures  we have adopted the following accounting policies which management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates and assumptions in the financial preparation process 
accounting for the effects of regulation 
duquesne light prepares its financial statements in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  which differs in certain respects from the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america by non regulated businesses 
in general  sfas no 
recognizes that accounting for rate regulated enterprises should reflect the economic effects of regulation 
as a result  a regulated utility is required to defer the recognition of costs a regulatory asset if it is probable that  through the rate making process  there will be a corresponding increase in future rates 
accordingly  duquesne light defers certain costs  which will be amortized over future periods 
to the extent that collection of such costs is no longer probable as a result of changes in regulation or competitive position  the associated regulatory assets are charged to expense 
see note unbilled electricity revenues 
holdings and duquesne light record revenues related to the sale of electricity when delivery is made to customers 
however  the determination of such sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters  which duquesne light reads on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each month  holdings and duquesne light estimate the amount of electricity delivered to each customer since the date of the last meter reading based on actual daily meter reads or  alternatively  estimated daily use based on rate specific  statistically estimated  hourly consumption patterns 
unbilled revenues are estimated each month based on the rate class specific unbilled electricity sales and the corresponding average retail rate 
customer accounts receivable as of december   and  include unbilled revenues of million and million at holdings  and million and million at duquesne light 
impairment of long lived assets and investments 
we evaluate long lived assets including other intangibles of identifiable business activities and 
table of contents investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
in addition to those long lived assets and investments for which impairment charges were recorded in and see note  others were reviewed for which no impairment was required 
for long lived assets to be held and used  these computations used judgments and assumptions inherent in management s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to determine recoverability of the assets 
it is possible that a computation under a held for sale situation for certain of these long lived assets could result in a significantly different assessment because of market conditions  specific transaction terms or a buyer s different viewpoint of future cash flows 
for investments  we considered our investee s cash on hand  financing abilities  customers  contracts and overall ability to continue as a going concern 
no impairment charges were recorded in pension and other postretirement benefit plan assumptions 
we provide pension benefit plans covering substantially all of our full time employees 
we also provide postretirement benefits for some retired employees 
the retiree medical benefits terminate when retirees reach age we account for these benefits in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
we record amounts related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on actuarial valuations 
inherent in those valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected returns on plan assets  compensation increases  and health care cost trend rates 
these actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate 
changes in these assumptions could have a significant effect on our non cash pension income or expense or on our postretirement benefit costs 
the effect of changes in these assumptions is generally recorded or amortized over future periods 
we discounted our future pension and other postretirement plan obligations using a rate of as of december   compared to as of december  we determine the discount rate by considering the yield rates on corporate high grade bonds  including relative year over year changes 
both the pension and other postretirement plan obligations and related expense increase as the discount rate is reduced 
the assumed rate of return on plan assets in the pension plans is the weighted average of long term returns forecast for the type of investments held by the plans 
as the expected rate of return on plan assets increases  the pension plan expense decreases  however the postretirement plan expense is unaffected as this plan has no assets 
for  the assumed rate of return on plan assets in the pension plans was 
we revised this assumption to for both and to more closely align with our expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the liabilities for the postretirement plans 
the health care trend assumption used in the development of the fiscal postretirement benefit plan expense was for fiscal year  decreasing to an ultimate rate of in in  we modified the postretirement plan design  which  beginning in  provided for greater cost sharing by the participants 
we believe the assumptions used in recording obligations under the plans are reasonable based on our prior experience  market conditions  and the advice of plan actuaries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information about these assumptions  actual performance  amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for  and as of december   the fair value of the pension plan assets of million represented approximately of the projected benefit obligation of our pension plans 
our pension cost for was million and our expected pension gain for is million 
primarily because of the amortization of previous years net investment gains  our pension cost for and was negative  resulting in an increase in net income in each year 
the increase in our pension cost in reflects  among other factors  actual losses on the pension fund assets in both and  compared with an expected annual asset return assumption of in each of the years 
although the actual return on plan assets in of million and in of million significantly exceeded the assumed rate of return on plan assets of and  it does not fully mitigate the shortfall in the actual return on plan assets over the past few years 
our expense or credit for actual pension benefits in future periods will depend upon actual returns on plan assets and the key assumptions we use for future periods 
pursuant to the actuarial valuations that were performed  we were not required to make cash contributions to our pension plans in  nor will we be required to do so in see note however  in january  duquesne light contributed million to the pension plans to meet its regulatory obligation in connection with the puc s approval of the recovery of costs associated with an early retirement program in 
table of contents income taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we use the liability method in computing deferred taxes on all differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
these book tax differences occur when events and transactions recognized for financial reporting purposes are not recognized in the same period for tax purposes 
the deferred tax liability or asset is also adjusted in the period of enactment for the effect of changes in tax laws or rates 
our overall effective tax rate is significantly reduced by the income tax credits generated from our synthetic fuel  landfill gas and affordable housing investments 
we file a consolidated us federal income tax return with our subsidiaries  all of whom participate in an intercompany tax sharing arrangement which generally provides that taxable income for each subsidiary be calculated as if it filed a separate return 
duquesne light recognizes a regulatory asset for deferred tax liabilities that are expected to be recovered through rates 
the difference in the provision for deferred income taxes related to depreciation of electric plant in service and the amount that otherwise would be recorded under generally accepted accounting principles is deferred and included in regulatory assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
see note derivative instruments 
duquesne power has entered into energy commodity contracts in anticipation of fulfilling expected obligations during the polr iii period  and not for trading purposes 
at the inception of each contract  management assesses whether the contract qualifies as a derivative and formally documents the appropriate accounting treatment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted 
generally  contracts that are deemed derivative instruments are required to be marked to market and presented in the financial statements at fair value 
however  management may determine if the contracts qualify for the normal purchase and sale exemption as permitted by sfas no 
this exemption permits  at our option  the use of the accrual basis of accounting as opposed to mark to market accounting for the contracts 
the energy contracts entered into by duquesne power have been determined to be derivative instruments as defined by sfas no 
duquesne power accounts for the energy contracts using a combination of accrual and mark to market accounting based on contracted volumes and anticipated obligations during the polr iii period 
under the accrual basis of accounting  recognition of the contract s fair value is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements until the settlement of the contract has occurred  whereas under mark to market accounting  we record the fair value of these contracts as mark to market derivative assets or liabilities at the end of every reporting period 
we record the changes in the mark to market derivative assets or liabilities on a net basis in purchased power in our consolidated statements of income in the period of change 
the fair value of the mark to market contracts is estimated through the use of a valuation model using quoted market prices  when available 
such estimates require significant judgment as to assumptions and valuation methodologies deemed appropriate by management 
actual future results may vary from those assumptions utilized in the valuation models  and those variations could have a material impact on our results 
see note contingent liabilities 
we establish reserves for estimated loss contingencies when it is management s assessment that a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
reserves for contingent liabilities are based upon management s assumptions and estimates  advice of legal counsel  or other third parties regarding the probable outcomes of the matter 
should additional information become known  or circumstances change with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss indicating that the ultimate outcome will differ from the estimates  revisions to the estimated reserves for contingent liabilities would be recognized in income in that period 
such contingent liabilities include  but are not limited to  restructuring liabilities see note  income tax matters see note  and other commitments and contingencies see note 
dividends once all dividends on holdings preferred stock  series a convertible  liquidation preference per share holdings preferred stock  have been paid  dividends may be paid on holdings common stock as permitted by law and as declared by the board of directors 
as a holding company  substantially all of holdings assets shown on its consolidated balance sheets are held by subsidiaries 
accordingly  holdings earnings and cash flow  and holdings ability to meet its obligations  are largely dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of such subsidiaries and the distribution or other payment of such earnings in the form of dividends  loans or advances  and repayment of loans and advances from holdings 
holdings subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts due on securities or to make any funds available for such payments 
holdings practice has been for its subsidiaries to dividend their earnings on a quarterly basis  if cash is available 

table of contents holdings subsidiaries ability to make dividend payments or other distributions may be restricted by their obligations to holders of their outstanding debt and preferred securities and to their creditors  the availability of earnings and the needs of their businesses 
if duquesne light cannot pay common dividends  we may not be able to pay dividends on our common stock or preferred stock 
payments of dividends on duquesne light s common stock may be restricted by duquesne light s obligations to holders of preferred and preference stock pursuant to duquesne light s articles of incorporation 
no dividends or distributions may be made on duquesne light s common stock if duquesne light has not paid dividends on its preferred or preference stock 
dividends on duquesne light stock may also be effectively limited by the terms of certain financing agreements 
further  the aggregate amount of duquesne light s common stock dividend payments or distributions may not exceed certain percentages of net income if the ratio of total common shareholder s equity to total capitalization is less than specified percentages 
see notes and during  and  duquesne light paid dividends on common stock of million  million and million 
holdings has continuously paid dividends on its common stock since annual dividends per share  paid quarterly  were  and for the years  and most recently  in the first quarter of the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share payable on april  to holders of record on march  
the board regularly evaluates the dividend policy and sets the amount each quarter 
the level of dividends will continue to be influenced by many factors such as  among other things  earnings  financial condition and cash flows from subsidiaries  as well as general economic and competitive conditions

table of contents rate matters competitive transition charge and provider of last resort duquesne light customers may choose to receive their electric energy from an alternative generation supplier  otherwise they will be served through duquesne light s polr arrangements 
customers who select an alternative generation supplier pay for generation charges set by that supplier  and pay duquesne light transmission and distribution charges 
duquesne light retains the risk that customers will not pay for the polr generation supply 
however  a component of duquesne light s delivery rate is designed to cover the cost of a normal level of uncollectible accounts 
customers under special contracts  as well as a single customer class comprised of two industrial customers  continue to receive electric generation through duquesne light s polr i supply arrangement with orion  which was designed to be an income neutral arrangement 
these two industrial customers are the only customers from which duquesne light continues to collect the ctc 
the transition costs are being amortized over the same period that the ctc revenues are being recognized 
duquesne light is allowed to earn an pre tax return on the remaining uncollected ctc balance 
until december   polr customers from whom the ctc had been fully collected received their generation supply through polr ii 
duquesne light earned a margin per mwh supplied under polr ii 
currently  most customers who do not choose an alternative generation supplier are served through duquesne light s polr iii plan  which became effective january  under polr iii  residential and small commercial customers receive electric supply through december  at fixed rates approximately above polr ii generation rates 
for our large commercial and industrial customers  the current polr iii supply options are either a fixed price service based upon the results of a competitive request for proposal process  or an hourly price service that passes through real time spot market electricity prices 
duquesne light receives an adder as compensation for costs and risks involved in providing energy to these customers

energy pricing within pjm now includes the costs or benefits of transmission congestion experienced at each location within the region 
this is known as locational marginal pricing 
an auction based system of financial transmission rights ftr allows participants to hedge congestion risks 
ftr holders are paid or charged the day ahead congestion value of the transmission path for which they hold an ftr 
upon joining pjm  duquesne light received certain ftrs for the period january  through may  these ftrs have been determined to be derivative instruments  and will be accounted for using mark to market or hedge accounting 
duquesne light allocated some of its ftrs to its suppliers i duquesne power  as part of its full requirements contract to serve duquesne light s residential and small commercial polr load  and ii the fixed price service suppliers for the large commercial and industrial polr iii customers 
pjm members are required to obtain unforced capacity credits to ensure that the peak demand for electricity by each member s customers is backed up by a generation source within pjm 
as a result of its full requirements energy supply contract for both duquesne light and duquesne light energy  duquesne power has contracted for capacity credits with a notional amount of approximately million as of december  to meet a significant portion of this projected megawatt capacity obligation 
the ferc has issued a series of orders eliminating the regional through and out rates rtor for certain 
table of contents transmission services between the midwest independent system operator miso and pjm effective december  a transitional pricing mechanism called the seams elimination charge adjustment seca will be put in place through april in order to compensate transmission owners for the estimated revenue lost as a result of the elimination of the rtor 
each pjm zone  including the duquesne light zone  will be allocated a portion of the seca based on transmission services provided to that zone in and on february   the ferc issued an order accepting certain compliance filings that implement the seca for other ie  non duquesne light pjm zones  subject to refund and surcharge  as appropriate  and setting the case in its entirety for a formal hearing 
we expect that secas in the duquesne light zone will be treated in a similar fashion by the ferc  and likely will be consolidated with the on going hearing for the other zones 
for holdings and affiliates  the effective date of the secas will not be earlier then january  it is anticipated that the case may take over a year to reach a final decision 
there are several unresolved matters and legal challenges to the seca itself that are pending before the ferc on rehearing 
it is not known when the ferc will issue an order on these requests for rehearing 
we have been notified by pjm that billings for seca charges will not occur before the march pjm billing cycle 
through its hearing process  the ferc will determine both the total amount of seca charges applicable to the duquesne light zone  and the appropriate allocation of those charges among load serving entities in the duquesne light zone including duquesne light  dle and other competitive retail suppliers 
the proposed seca charges  when filed and accepted by the ferc and billed by the appropriate entities  must be paid by load serving entities within the duquesne light zone on a current basis 
if the ferc ultimately adopts a seca level and allocation method that differs from the proposed charges initially accepted by the ferc for billing purposes  refunds or surcharges will be used to compensate or charge the appropriate entity for the difference between the amounts initially accepted by the ferc and the amounts ultimately determined to be just and reasonable by the ferc 
the total seca charge for the duquesne light zone is not yet known because charges for the april through april period have not yet been filed 
however  using data applicable to the january through march period  the total seca charges for the duquesne light zone for the entire january through april period could be as much as the sum of i million in charges assessed by transmission owners in miso  and ii million in net charges assessed by transmission owners in pjm 
during march  duquesne light together with other pjm participants filed with the ferc a proposed allocation of seca charges among load serving entities within the duquesne light zone 
under that proposal  duquesne light would  using data applicable to the january through march period  be allocated approximately i million of the charges from miso transmission owners  and ii million of the net charges from pjm transmission owners 
the other load serving entities in the duquesne light zone would be allocated the remainder of such charges  with dle s allocation of combined miso and pjm charges expected to be approximately million 
the ferc is expected to act on this filing within days 
if the ferc accepts the filing  each load serving entity within the duquesne light zone would be required to pay its allocated share of the seca  subject to refund or surcharge pending final resolution by the ferc of disputes over appropriate level and allocation of seca charges 
in addition to the allocation of seca charges among load serving entities within the duquesne light zone  there are a number of issues that could affect the total level of charges to load serving entities in the duquesne light zone 
for example  duquesne light has argued that a significant portion of the charges from miso transmission owners approximately million of the estimated million should not be allocated to the duquesne light zone because they represent transmission revenues that would have terminated even if the rtor had not been eliminated 
if the ferc agrees with duquesne light on this issue  the seca charges applicable to the duquesne light zone could be significantly reduced 
there are other issues that have been or may be raised by duquesne light and other parties that also could affect the total amount of seca charges for the duquesne light zone that are ultimately approved by the ferc 
we will continue to pursue all avenues available to us to eliminate or reduce the seca obligations 
in addition  duquesne light believes it will recover these costs from its retail customers and will seek recovery once these issues are resolved by the ferc 
outlook building on the basics 
as part of a focused strategy to build on successes at our core  regulated electric utility business  we have identified three major initiatives to enhance our financial strength 
investing in duquesne light s transmission and distribution infrastructure 
supplying electricity to customers 
modestly growing our complementary businesses  primarily through landfill gas site expansion and development 

table of contents infrastructure  transmission and distribution rate cases 
duquesne light s future success depends on its ability to continue delivering electricity to its customers safely and reliably 
going forward  this means investing in infrastructure 
while we believe we have done a good job maintaining our infrastructure  significant investment is required if we are to be able to maintain our high standards for reliability and continue to provide a high level of customer service 
the department of energy recently projected that national electricity demand will grow by over the next decade  while the current pace of national infrastructure investment is only growing by 
in response  congress is considering mandating reliability standards for the power transmission grid 
we have conducted an extensive assessment of our system requirements and have identified a number of projects that need to be completed to maintain the reliability and quality of our service 
as a regulated utility  duquesne light may only change its transmission or distribution rates by applying  through the rate case process  to the ferc or the puc for approval 
the goal of a rate case is to establish customer rates such that the utility i recovers its costs of providing the service  ii recovers its costs of investing in the transmission and or distribution infrastructure  and iii earns a reasonable and fair return on that investment 
during a rate case  the utility must prove that its proposed rate increase is needed by showing its costs during a given test year 
the utility s costs and expenditures are reviewed and challenged during this process 
a rate case also considers a utility s rate of return on its investment  as well as its costs of financing  in order to derive its annual revenue requirement 
the rates ultimately set are intended to give the utility a reasonable chance to achieve its revenue requirement 
since customer choice was instituted in pennsylvania in  rate caps have prevented recovery of any new investment in transmission and distribution 
the last duquesne light rate case involving transmission and distribution costs dates back to our transmission and distribution rate freeze expired at the end of we plan to file transmission and distribution rate cases in or financial restructuring 
duquesne light plans to finance its additional infrastructure investments in a prudent manner to minimize financing costs while maintaining the integrity of its capital structure 
currently  duquesne light s capital structure common equity component of at december  cannot support the issuance of additional debt or preferred stock to finance the infrastructure investments because it could impair its credit profile  resulting in limited access to capital markets and higher borrowing costs 
consequently  increased equity and or reduced debt will be needed at duquesne light to strengthen its balance sheet 
all of the common stock of duquesne light is held by holdings 
accordingly  any increase in common equity at duquesne light will be provided by holdings 
holdings capitalization structure reflects the consolidation of all of its subsidiaries  including duquesne light 
the effects on holdings capital structure resulting from increasing duquesne light s common equity will depend on the manner in which holdings obtains and deploys the funds  as explained below 
in  duquesne light received approximately billion in net proceeds from selling its electric generating assets 
duquesne light had previously issued tax exempt pollution control revenue bonds pcrbs to finance pollution control assets at those generation stations 
duquesne light decided to keep the low cost pcrbs outstanding and loaned million of the sale proceeds to holdings 
in addition  million was paid to holdings as a special dividend 
as a result  the equity component of duquesne light was significantly reduced by the combined effects of keeping the pcrbs outstanding and paying the dividend to holdings 
the pcrbs and the million intercompany note remain outstanding as of february  holdings plans to repay the million intercompany loan and increase the equity component of duquesne light s capitalization 
in order to raise funds to repay the intercompany note  holdings plans to issue up to million of replacement debt 
duquesne light will use the proceeds from the repayment of the intercompany note to retire a like amount of its pcrbs  which will reduce the debt component of its capitalization 
holdings equity will remain unchanged with the simultaneous issuance and retirement of the same amount of debt on a consolidated basis 
this financial restructuring should result in higher credit ratings  improved access to the capital markets and lower borrowing costs for duquesne light and its ratepayers 
energy supply opportunities 
energy supply has been a major source of earnings for the last three years 
it will continue to be an important element of our strategic plan for the next three years and  given the right regulatory treatment  beyond 
we will seek to maximize the retention of customers  either through polr iii or through holdings electric generation supplier  dle 

table of contents landfill gas opportunities 
we continue to improve the underlying operations of our key landfill gas business 
we now own of wet  a nationally recognized firm specializing in landfill gas engineering  design  construction and operation 
we also now manage the operations of certain key landfill gas production facilities and have strategically invested modest capital dollars to maximize our existing production capacities 
in addition  we have reduced operating costs and improved relationships with key stakeholders  such as landfill owners and pipeline customers 
today  we have a business case that supports owning these assets well beyond the expiration of the section tax credit generation period 
at duquesne light holdings  we are committed to delivering value for shareholders by continuing to build on the successes we have achieved at the core electric utility and complementary businesses 
forward looking statements the preceding sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain forward looking statements  the results of which may materially differ from those implied due to known and unknown risks and uncertainties  some of which are discussed below 
cash flow  earnings  earnings growth  capitalization  capital expenditures and dividends will depend on the performance of holdings subsidiaries  and board policy 
demand for and pricing of electricity and landfill gas  changing market conditions and weather conditions could affect earnings levels 
duquesne light s earnings including any polr margin will be affected by the number of customers who choose to receive electric generation through polr iii  by our ability to negotiate appropriate terms with suitable generation suppliers  and by the performance of these suppliers 
projected polr supply requirements will depend on polr customer retention  which in turn may depend on market generation prices  as well as the marketing efforts of competing generation suppliers 
transmission and distribution rate base and earnings will depend on the ultimate structure of our rate cases  which in turn will be subject to puc and ferc review and approval 
earnings will also be affected by rate base  equity and allowed return levels 
rto rules and ferc mandated transmission charges could affect earnings 
changes in electric energy prices could affect earnings as the recorded value of our mark to market energy commodity contracts fluctuates 
the amount and timing of any debt reduction or refinancing will depend on the availability of cash flows and appropriate replacement or refinancing vehicles 
the amount and timing of any securities issuance debt or equity will depend on financial market performance 
the credit ratings received from the rating agencies could affect the cost of borrowing  access to capital markets and liquidity 
customer energy demand  fuel costs and plant operations could affect duquesne energy solutions earnings 
competition and operating costs could affect earnings and expansion plans in our landfill gas business 
the outcome of the shareholder litigation initiated against holdings may affect performance 
earnings with respect to synthetic fuel operations  landfill gas and affordable housing investments will depend  in part  on the continued viability of  and compliance with the requirements for  applicable federal tax credits 
demand for dark fiber will affect dqe communications earnings 
the final resolution of proposed adjustments regarding state income tax liabilities which could depend on negotiations with the appropriate authorities could affect financial position  earnings  and cash flows 
overall performance by holdings and its affiliates could be affected by economic  competitive  regulatory  governmental and technological factors affecting operations  markets  products  services and prices  as well as the factors discussed in duquesne light holdings sec filings made to date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of financial loss that may impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in market prices and rates 
both holdings and duquesne light have potential market risk exposures to interest rate risk  commodity price risk and credit default risk 
holdings also faces the potential risk of section tax credit phase out 
holdings and duquesne light have risk management 
table of contents procedures to monitor and assist in controlling these market risks and may use derivative and other instruments to manage some of these exposures 
interest rate risk 
we manage our interest rate risk by balancing our exposure between fixed and variable rates and exploring strategic opportunities to lock in favorable interest rates on anticipated debt offerings  while attempting to minimize our interest costs 
currently  the variable interest rate debt for holdings and for duquesne light is million  which represents approximately of both holdings and duquesne light s long term debt 
this variable rate debt is low cost  tax exempt debt with an average variable interest rate of for the year ended december  we also manage our interest rate risk by retiring and issuing debt from time to time and by maintaining a range of maturity dates 
a increase in interest rates would have affected both holdings and duquesne light s variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense by approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and a reduction in interest rates would have increased the market value of fixed rate debt by approximately million for both holdings and duquesne light as of december  such changes would not have had a significant near term effect on our future earnings or cash flows 
commodity price risk 
both holdings and duquesne light are exposed to commodity price risk arising from market price fluctuations in electricity supply 
we manage this risk by entering into energy commodity contracts  principally through duquesne power 
the energy commodity contracts have been structured to begin and end during the polr iii time period 
as of december   energy purchase contracts have a total notional value of approximately million 
for load shaping purposes  duquesne power also entered into energy contracts to sell power obtained in excess of its anticipated supply obligations  primarily during off peak periods 
as of december   these sale contracts have a notional value of approximately million 
the net result of these transactions is that  as of december   duquesne power had secured a substantial portion of the combined expected load obligation for its full requirements contracts with duquesne light and dle through if duquesne power does not enter into contracts for the remaining portion of its anticipated obligations  it will acquire the necessary supply through spot market purchases  and will therefore be exposed to market risk 
assuming duquesne power were to make such spot market purchases  we performed a sensitivity analysis using a hypothetical increase in the projected forward market prices of electricity supply in our valuation model 
the analysis indicated that such market movements would change the projected cost of acquiring electricity supply by approximately million for the polr iii period through the projected forward market prices used in our valuation model are derived from broker quotes and industry publications with comparable delivery point prices within pjm for both on peak and off peak power 
our valuation model seasonalizes annual or quarterly prices based on historical trends 
actual costs in the future may differ significantly from our analysis  however  based on changes in the timing and amount of commodity price fluctuations and our actual exposures 
all of the energy contracts are classified as derivative instruments under sfas no 
 as amended and interpreted 
as of december  the fair value of the sale contracts and certain purchase contracts with a notional value of approximately million have been recorded as mark to market derivative assets or liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
the remaining purchase contracts with a notional value of approximately million qualify for accrual accounting under the normal purchase and sale exemption 
the mark to market contracts are exposed to commodity price risk based on price changes in the forward energy market 
therefore  as the forward market prices change  so will the fair value of these contracts 
a hypothetical increase in the projected forward market prices of electricity supply would increase the fair value of our mark to market energy contracts by approximately million  while a corresponding decrease would decrease the fair value of our mark to market energy contracts by approximately million as of december  as a result of fixed polr prices for our residential and small commercial customers through december   and customers being able to initiate switches to and from polr service  we have an additional risk of loss 
specifically  customers could opt for polr service in a period of high energy prices or leave polr service for an alternative generation supplier in a period of low energy prices 
significant changes in customer switching behavior could cause duquesne power s energy supply portfolio to be disproportionate to its full requirements obligations to duquesne light 
accordingly  duquesne power could be required to purchase or sell power in periods of high or low prices which could result in a loss 
we mitigate this risk as part of our overall risk management strategy by contracting for firm energy 
table of contents purchases within a range of probabilities based on historical customer retention rates and switching trends along with projected forward energy prices 
credit default risk 
our credit risk is the exposure to the possibility of economic loss that would occur as a result of nonperformance by counter parties of their contractual obligations 
as part of our overall risk management strategy  duquesne power has entered into fixed price energy contracts with eight investment grade suppliers and has contracted for unforced capacity credits from five suppliers 
as of december   duquesne power has contracted to purchase from one supplier approximately  and of the notional values of the energy commodity contracts for the years ended december   and  with no other supplier representing as much as for each of the respective years 
duquesne power s energy commodity contracts contain certain safeguards designed to mitigate potential losses by requiring collateral to be posted by either party depending on changes in energy or capacity prices 
due to decreases in the forward market price of electricity supply from the inception of certain energy contracts  we have posted million of collateral with one counter party as of february  duquesne light purchases energy and capacity  beginning january   under a full requirements contract from two investment grade suppliers for sale to its large commercial and industrial customers receiving fixed price polr iii service 
duquesne light s contracts only require collateral to be posted by the counter party 
as of february  no collateral was required to be posted under these contracts 
in addition to collateral postings  supplier default risk is further mitigated by accelerated damage payment terms 
if a supplier fails to deliver the contracted power  we may exercise our right to force the supplier to compensate us for the difference between the market price and the contracted price of power 
if such supplier would fail to make the accelerated damage payments  the supplier would be in default and we would be permitted to apply any funds due that supplier against our excess energy costs 
other than large commercial and industrial polr iii customers on hourly priced service  duquesne light is obligated to serve its polr iii customers at fixed rates 
duquesne power is also contractually obligated to serve its customers  duquesne light and dle  at fixed rates 
if an energy supplier to duquesne light or duquesne power were to default on its contract  we could potentially be acquiring energy and or capacity at a cost in excess of our revenues  resulting in a loss  if the collateral provisions were not sufficient to cover such excess 
if this would occur it is uncertain  under the current puc approved polr iii arrangement  that duquesne light could pass any additional costs related to these energy and capacity purchases on to its customers 
tax credit phase out 
section tax credits are subject to a phase out provision that could reduce tax credits as the average annual wellhead price per barrel of domestic crude oil increases into an inflation adjusted phase out range 
for  the tax credit would have begun to phase out when the annual average wellhead price per barrel of domestic crude oil exceeded per barrel and would have been completely phased out when the annual average wellhead price per barrel of domestic crude oil reached per barrel 
the inflation adjustment has not been published by the irs but based on the prices of oil during the year  we do not believe that a phase out of the credit for will occur 
we cannot predict the level of domestic crude oil prices for nor whether a phase out of the credit is likely to occur
