item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regarding the company s capital expenditures 
competition the supermarket industry is highly competitive and characterized by narrow profit margins 
the degree of competition the company s stores face varies by location  primarily based on the size of the community the store is located in and its proximity to other communities 
the company s principal competitors are  in alphabetical order  bi lo  inc  food lion  inc  the kroger co  inc  publix supermarkets  inc  and wal mart  inc 
increasingly over the last few years  competition for consumers food dollars has intensified due to the addition of  or increase in  food sections by many types of retailers such as specialty grocers  drug and convenience stores  national general merchandisers and discount retailers  membership clubs  warehouse stores and super centers 
also  the consumer trend of eating out has made restaurants another significant competitor for food dollars 
supermarket chains generally compete on the basis of location  quality of products  service  price  convenience  product variety and store condition 
the company believes its competitive advantages include convenient locations  the quality of service it provides its customers  competitive pricing  product variety and quality and a pleasant shopping environment  which is enhanced by its ongoing modernization program 
the company s strategy is to place its supermarkets in suburban areas  small towns and rural communities 
because the company has operated in many of its markets longer than its competitors  it has been able to place its stores in prime locations 
furthermore  unlike many of its competitors  the company owns property on which a majority of its stores are located  allowing it the flexibility to expand the store when needed 
by concentrating its operations within a relatively small geographic region  the company is also positioned to more carefully monitor its markets  and the needs of its customers within those markets 
the top management of the company is living and working in its operating region allowing management to quickly identify changes in needs and customer preference 
given the company s size  such managers have direct access to corporate management and are able to receive quick approval to requested changes in operations 
the company can then move quickly to make adjustments in its business in response to changes in the market and customer needs 
the ingles advantage savings and reward card provides information to better understand the company s customers shopping patterns in various demographic categories and to develop targeted marketing programs based on this information 
the company supports its quality image by carrying high quality perishable items 
one major quality advantage of the company is that it offers its customers usda choice beef cut by butchers located in the stores 
many of ingles competitors do not offer usda choice beef and do not have butchers located in their stores 
the company has expanded its offering of certified organic products to include organic dairy  perishable and frozen items 
the company also carries a wide variety of produce  quality private label brands plus a variety of popular national and regional brands 
the company s large national and international competitors primary advantages are related to their size 
these larger organizations may have an advantage through stronger buying power and more significant capital resources 
certain competitors  such as super centers  may be able to operate with smaller margins in the food sections of their stores by relying on their higher margins on the general merchandise sections of their stores to compensate 
the company s management monitors competitive activity and regularly reviews and periodically adjusts the company s marketing and business strategies as management deems appropriate in light of existing conditions in the company s region 
the company s ability to remain competitive in its changing markets will depend in part on its ability to pursue its expansion and renovation programs and its response to remodeling and new store openings by its competitors 
seasonality sales in the grocery segment of the company s business are subject to a slight seasonal variance due to holiday related sales and due to sales in areas where seasonal homes are located 
sales are traditionally higher in the company s first fiscal quarter due to the inclusion of sales related to thanksgiving and christmas 
the company s second fiscal quarter traditionally has the lowest sales of the year 
in the third and fourth quarter  sales are affected by the return of customers to seasonal homes in our market area 
the fluid dairy segment of the company s business has slight seasonal variation to the extent of its sales into the grocery industry 
the company s real estate segment is not subject to seasonal variations

in addition  the company focuses on selling high growth  high margin products to its customers through the development of book sections  media centers  floral departments  bakery departments and prepared foods including delicatessen sections 
during fiscal  the company began adding fuel centers and pharmacies at select store locations 
as of september   the company operates in store pharmacies and fuel centers 
ingles also operates two other lines of business  fluid dairy processing and shopping center rentals 
the fluid dairy processing segment sells approximately of its products to the retail grocery segment and approximately of its products to third parties 
real estate ownership including the shopping center rental segment is an important component of the company s operations  providing both operational and economic benefit 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of ingles financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
self insurance the company is self insured for workers compensation and group medical and dental benefits 
risks and uncertainties are associated with self insurance  however  the company has limited its exposure by maintaining excess liability coverages 
self insurance reserves are established based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
the estimates are based on data provided by the respective claims administrators 
these estimates can fluctuate if historical trends are not predictive of the future 
the majority of the company s properties are self insured for casualty losses and business interruption  however  liability coverage is maintained 
asset impairments the company tests for impairment of long lived assets annually unless events and changes in circumstances indicate that additional testing is necessary 
the company accounts for the impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
for assets to be held and used  the company tests for impairment using undiscounted cash flows and calculates the amount of impairment using discounted cash flows 
for assets held for sale  impairment is recognized based on the excess of remaining book value over expected recovery value 
the recovery value is the fair value as determined by independent quotes or expected sales prices developed by internal specialists 
estimates of future cash flows and expected sales prices are judgments based upon the company s experience and knowledge of local operations and cash flows that are projected for several years into the future 
these estimates can fluctuate significantly due to changes in real estate market conditions  the economic environment  capital spending decisions and inflation 
closed store accrual for properties closed prior to december  that were under long term lease agreements  the present value of any remaining liability under the lease  discounted using risk free rates and net of expected sublease recovery  is recognized as a liability and expensed 
for all store closures subsequent to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
effective december   the liability is recognized and expensed based on the difference between the present value of any remaining liability under the lease and the present value of the estimated market rate at which the company expects to be able to sublease the properties 
the company s estimates of market rates are based on its experience  knowledge and typical third party advice or market data 
if the real estate and leasing markets change  sublease recovery could vary significantly from the recoveries originally assumed  resulting in a material change in the company s recorded liability 
vendor allowances the company receives funds for a variety of merchandising activities from the many vendors whose products the company buys for resale in its stores 
these incentives and allowances include volume or purchase based incentives  advertising allowances  slotting fees  and promotional discounts 
the purpose of these incentives and allowances is generally to help defray the costs incurred by the company for stocking  advertising  promoting and selling the vendor s products 
whenever possible  vendor discounts and allowances that relate to buying and merchandising activities are recorded as a component of item cost in inventory and recognized in merchandise costs when the item is sold 
due to system constraints and the nature of certain allowances  it is sometimes not practicable to apply allowances to the item cost of inventory 
in those instances  the allowances are applied as a reduction of merchandise costs using a rational and systematic methodology  which results in the recognition of these incentives when the inventory related to the initial purchase is sold 
amounts that represent a reimbursement of specific identifiable incremental costs  such as advertising  are recorded as a reduction to the related expense in the period that the related expense is incurred 
tax contingencies despite the company s belief that its tax positions are consistent with applicable tax laws  the company believes that certain positions are likely to be challenged by taxing authorities 
settlement of any challenge can result in no change  a complete disallowance  or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the company s tax contingencies 
the company s contingencies are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of its tax audits as well as evolving case law 
income tax expense includes the impact of contingency provisions and changes to contingencies that the company considers appropriate 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require use of cash 
favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to income tax expense at the time of resolution
