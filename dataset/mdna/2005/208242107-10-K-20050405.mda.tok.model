general our consolidated financial statements and related notes comprise over pages 
we intend the following discussion and analysis to provide you with a better understanding of our financial condition and performance in the indicated periods  including an analysis of those key factors that contributed to our financial condition and performance and that are  or are expected to be  the key drivers of our business 

table of contents we  through our retail stores  provide products and services to our customers in  currently  six primary market areas  including houston  san antonio austin  dallas fort worth  southern louisiana  southeast texas  and south texas 
products and services offered through retail sales outlets include major home appliances  consumer electronics  home office equipment  lawn and garden products  mattresses  service maintenance agreements  customer credit programs  including installment and revolving credit account services  and various credit insurance products 
these activities are supported through our extensive service  warehouse and distribution system 
our stores bear the conn s name  after our founder s family  and deliver the same products and services to our customers 
all of our stores follow the same procedures and methods in managing their operations 
the company s management evaluates performance and allocates resources based on the operating results of the retail stores and considers the credit programs  service contracts and distribution system to be an integral part of the company s retail operations 
presented below is a diagram setting forth our five cornerstones which represent  in our view  the five components of our sales goal strong merchandising systems  state of the art credit options for our customers  extensive warehousing and distribution system  a service system to all of our customers that extends beyond the warranty periods  and our uniquely  well trained employees in each area 
each of these systems combine to create a nuts and bolts support system for our customers needs and desires 
each of these systems is discussed at length in the business section of this report 
logo we  of course  derive a large part of our revenue from our product sales 
however  unlike many of our competitors  we provide in house credit options for our customers product purchases 
in the last three years  we have financed  on average  approximately of our retail sales through these programs 
in turn  we finance convert to cash substantially all of our customer receivables from these credit options through an asset backed securitization facility 
see business finance operations for a detailed discussion of our in house credit programs 
as part of our asset backed securitization facility  we have created a qualifying special purpose entity  which we refer to as the qspe or the issuer  to purchase customer receivables from us and to issue asset backed and variable funding notes to third parties to fund such purchases 
we transfer our receivables  consisting of retail installment contracts and revolving accounts extended to our customers  to the issuer in exchange for cash and subordinated securities 
while our warehouse and distribution system does not directly generate revenues  other than the fees paid by our customers for delivery and installation of the products to their homes  it is our extra  value added program that our existing customers have come to rely on  and our new customers are hopefully impressed with sufficient to become repeat customers 
we derive revenues from our repair services on the products we sell 
additionally  acting as an agent for unaffiliated companies  we sell credit insurance to protect our customers from credit losses due to death  disability  involuntary unemployment and damage to the products they have purchased  to the extent they do not already have it 

table of contents executive overview this overview is intended to provide an executive level overview of our operations for our fiscal year ended january  a detailed explanation of the changes in our operations for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to the prior year is included beginning on page following are significant financial items in managements view our revenues for the fiscal year ended january  increased by percent  or million  from fiscal year to million due to sales growth and increased securitization income 
our pretax income for fiscal increased by percent or approximately million  from fiscal to million 
our pretax income was negatively impacted by the required implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
the cost of the implementation  not including the man hours of our employees  during our fiscal year was approximately  we believe the cost of continued testing and compliance will be substantially less than that expended during fiscal our same store sales growth rate for the fiscal year ended january  was  with same store revenues increasing from million for fiscal to million for fiscal year the same store growth rate for fiscal was 
we believe that our continued introduction of new and improved products for the track area of our stores  as well as our new relationship with serta for our sale of mattresses will allow our same store sales to continue in positive growth rates during fiscal operating cash flows from operations were  for fiscal our operating cash flows decreased as a result of offering interest free promotional credit programs which helped increase sales 
we amended our asset backed securitization programs to allow inclusion of a portion of the promotional credit receivables which moderated the impact on cash of the increased offering 
we will continue to seek a market for the financing of these receivables in order to attain a higher percentage being funded 
revenues of million for fiscal from the eight new stores we opened in the dallas fort worth metroplex during fiscal and fiscal are not included in same store sales figures for fiscal because of the timing of their opening 
due to the staggered opening of the stores in this market  including three in the final quarter of fiscal  a comparison to fiscal does not accurately reflect the significant impact of this market 
our gross product margin was for fiscal year  an increase from in fiscal our operating margin increased to from in fiscal these margins were positively impacted by improved margins to the floor generally as a result of excitement generated in the marketplace by lower prices on technology products in our track  consumer electronics and appliances 
our gross product and operating margins were also positively impacted by moderation of initial start up costs as a result of our entry in the dallas fort worth metroplex market  as standby costs in personnel and advertising in the market were shared by more stores and greater sales 
as of january   we no longer lease any properties from specialized realty development services  lp  or srds  a variable interest entity that has been consolidated into our financial statements pursuant to the provisions of interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin 
during fiscal  srds sold all of its properties  subject to our leases  to ge commercial finance business property 
as a result of that transaction  we no longer have any relationship  directly or indirectly  with srds  and the provisions of fin relative to variable interest entities no longer apply to our financials 
consequently  the consolidated balance sheet at january  does not include accounts of srds that were previously consolidated with our financial statements 
this exclusion reduced cash  total property and equipment  debt and minority interests reflected in our financial statements by approximately 
table of contents million  million  million  and million  respectively 
however  our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for fiscal include the operations and cash flows of srds through the dates the sales were completed 
since fin will no longer applies to these leases  the company will prospectively classify all lease payments made under the leases as lease expense  as it does all other operating leases  rather than recording depreciation  interest and minority interest as previously reported under the provisions of fin the company s pre tax income will not be impacted 
the completion of the transaction by srds will have no effect on the operations of the company  as the company s existing leases remain in effect  with the new owner becoming the company s landlord 
our shareholders equity is not impacted 
in late  we utilized the net proceeds of our initial public offering to retire all of our balance sheet debt and thereby substantially reduce our interest expense since the last quarter of fiscal furthermore  the discontinuation of hedge accounting in fiscal impacted our interest expense as the change in fair value of derivatives is being recorded as an adjustment to operations rather than through other comprehensive income oci 
as an offset to this present benefit  we are amortizing the balance previously recorded to oci over the period in which the remaining hedge amounts impacts the statement of operations which will end april  operational changes and resulting outlook we have implemented  continued increased focus on or modified several initiatives in fiscal that we believe will positively impact our future operating results  including increased our promotional interest only products to include  and month options  offered at strategic times during the seasonal fluctuations in our operations  and implemented our ability to include a portion of the resulting receivables in our asset backed securitization programs  continued and increased use of our direct mail marketing campaign as a single promotional activity rather than necessarily combining it with other promotional programs  which we believe not only increased our new customer base  but also reduced the amount of the price discounts that are sometimes required in order to influence our customers purchasing decisions  identification of demographic constituencies within a given us postal service carrier route for our direct mail campaigns combined with an increase in promotional credit  which we believe allowed us to obtain better direct penetration rates for our promotional campaigns  continued development and implementation of strategies for the merchandising of our track products  including inventory diversification  separate merchandising plans and displays  separate sales and managerial personnel  and convenient check out procedures  which we believe increased sales within the track area  but which also necessarily decreased our gross product margin percentage as a result of the pricing of this type of product  continued attention to and refinement of our existing display space to provide additional footage and attractive presentation to promote lawn and garden products  since our stores are in a geographic area that is conducive to year around use of these products  further modification of our sales commission plan  which we believe further aligned our sales personnel compensation with our overall sales objectives our continued growth in the dallas fort worth metroplex and surrounding areas is dependent on our ability to develop an adequate distribution center for that market 
the present cross dock facility in that market contains approximately  square feet and will accommodate approximately seven to ten stores 
we are currently in the planning stages to develop a complete warehouse and distribution center for this market that we expect to contain approximately  to  square feet 
additional annual cost to lease and operate such a facility is projected at approximately million  but savings in costs of distribution and re inventorying of a new facility is expected to reduce the impact of such additional cost 
we expect that we will open a new distribution center for the dallas fort worth and surrounding distribution areas during the second or third quarter of fiscal 
table of contents the consumer electronics industry depends on new products to drive same store sales increases 
typically  these new products  such as digital televisions  dvd players  digital cameras and mp players are introduced at relatively high price points that are then gradually reduced as the product becomes more mainstream 
to maintain positive same store sales growth  unit sales must increase at a rate greater than the decline in product prices 
the affordability of the product helps drive the unit sales growth 
however  as a result of relatively short product life cycles in the consumer electronics industry  which limit the amount of time available for sales volume to increase  combined with rapid price erosion in the industry  retailers are challenged to maintain overall gross margin levels and positive same store sales 
this has historically been our experience  and we continue to adjust our marketing strategies to address this challenge through the introduction of new product categories and new products within our existing categories 
application of critical accounting policies in applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
some of these accounting estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates 
we base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on authoritative pronouncements  historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis 
we could reasonably use different accounting estimates  and changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period  with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates 
we believe that the critical accounting estimates discussed below are among those most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as of january  transfers of financial assets 
we transfer customer receivables to the qspe that issues asset backed securities to third party lenders using these accounts as collateral  and we continue to service these accounts after the transfer 
we recognize the sale of these accounts when we relinquish control of the transferred financial asset in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
as we transfer the accounts  we record an asset representing the interest only strip  which is cash flows resulting entirely from the interest on the security 
the gain or loss recognized on these transactions is based on our best estimates of key assumptions  including forecasted credit losses  payment rates  forward yield curves  costs of servicing the accounts and appropriate discount rates 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  if we had assumed a reduction in net interest spread which might be caused by rising interest rates  our interest in securitized assets would have been reduced by million as of january   which may have an adverse effect on earnings 
we recognize income from our interest in these transferred accounts based on the difference between the interest earned on customer accounts and the costs associated with financing and servicing the transferred accounts  less a provision for bad debts associated with the transferred assets 
this income is recorded as finance charges and other in our consolidated statement of operations 
if the assumption used for developing the reserve for doubtful accounts on the books of the qspe were changed by from to  the impact to recorded finance charges and other would have been a reduction in revenues and pretax income of million 
deferred tax assets 
we have significant net deferred tax assets approximately million as of january   which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realization of our net deferred tax assets may be dependent upon whether we achieve projected future taxable income 
our estimates regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  our ability to continue to execute at historical levels and our ability to continue our growth plans 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to these deferred tax asset balances 
for example  if we had assumed that the future tax rate at which these deferred items would reverse was rather than  we would have reduced the net deferred tax asset and net income by approximately  intangible assets 
we have significant intangible assets related primarily to goodwill 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
effective august   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
prior to adoption of sfas  we amortized goodwill over an estimated life of fifteen years on a straight line 
table of contents basis 
effective with the implementation of sfas  we ceased amortizing goodwill and began testing potential impairment of this asset annually based on judgments regarding ongoing profitability and cash flow of the underlying assets 
changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
for example  if we had reason to believe that our recorded goodwill had become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the underlying business  we would have to take a charge to income for that portion of goodwill that we believe is impaired 
our goodwill balance at january  and was million property  plant and equipment 
our accounting policies regarding land  buildings  and equipment include judgments regarding the estimated useful lives of such assets  the estimated residual values to which the assets are depreciated  and the determination as to what constitutes increasing the life of existing assets 
these judgments and estimates may produce materially different amounts of depreciation and amortization expense than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
these judgments may also impact the need to recognize an impairment charge on the carrying amount of these assets if the anticipated cash flows associated with the assets are not realized 
in addition  the actual life of the asset and residual value may be different from the estimates used to prepare financial statements in prior periods 
revenue recognition 
revenues from the sale of retail products are recognized at the time the product is delivered to the customer 
such revenues are recognized net of any adjustments for sales incentive offers such as discounts  coupons  rebates  or other free products or services 
we sell service maintenance agreements and credit insurance contracts on behalf of unrelated third parties 
for contracts where the third parties are the obligor on the contract  commissions are recognized in revenues at the time of sale  and in the case of retrospective commissions  based on claims experience  at the time that they are earned 
when we sell service maintenance agreements in which we are deemed to be the obligor on the contract at the time of sale  revenue is recognized ratably  on a straight line basis  over the term of the service maintenance agreement 
these direct obligor service maintenance agreements are renewal contracts that provide our customers protection against product repair costs arising after the expiration of the manufacturer s warranty and the third party obligor contracts and typically range from months to months 
these agreements are separate units of accounting under emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the amounts of service maintenance agreement revenue deferred at january  and were million and million  respectively  and are included in deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets 
the amounts of service maintenance agreement revenue recognized for the fiscal years ended january   and were million  million and million  respectively 
vendor allowances 
we receive funds from vendors for price protection  product rebates  marketing and training and promotion programs which are recorded on the accrual basis as a reduction to the related product cost or advertising expense according to the nature of the program 
we accrue rebates based on the satisfaction of terms of the program and sales of qualifying products even though funds may not be received until the end of a quarter or year 
if the programs are related to product purchases  the allowances  credits or payments are recorded as a reduction of product cost  if the programs are related to promotion or marketing of the product  the allowances  credits  or payments are recorded as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the expense is incurred 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in december  statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  was issued 
this statement establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  focusing primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains an employees services 
the statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of the award  and record that cost over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
additionally  the statement provides multiple options for adopting the requirements of the standard 
we are currently analyzing the impact this statement will have on our consolidated results of operations and our financial position 
we are required under existing accounting standards to provide supplemental disclosure in the footnotes to our financial statements as if our financial statements had been prepared using the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
see note to our financial statements for additional information 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations information as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated 
years ended january  revenues product sales service maintenance agreement commissions net service revenues total net sales finance charges and other total revenues cost and expenses cost of goods sold  including warehousing and occupancy costs cost of parts sold  including warehousing and occupancy costs selling  general and administrative expense provision for bad debts total costs and expenses operating income interest expense including minority interest earnings before income taxes provision for income taxes current deferred total provision for income taxes net income in reviewing the percentages reflected in the above table  we noted that the following trends in our operations developed within the last twelve months 
they are summarized as follows service revenues as a percentage of total revenues are continuing to decline 
this decrease is attributable to a more stringent review of claims submitted under our third party and company obligor service maintenance agreement programs for warranty repair services 
as a result of these reviews  however  retrospective commissions  due to claims reductions  have increased 
these commissions are included in finance charges and other 
the slight decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of total revenues reflects the shift in product mix as we continue to grow the track category 
we expect this trend to continue 
the decline in selling  general and administrative expense reflects the implementation of various cost reduction programs and the achievement of economies of scale as revenue continues to grow 
we expect to continue to incur significant additional administrative costs associated with being a publicly held company  eg the costs associated with implementing sarbanes oxley section in fiscal and the expected continued cost of compliance with this and other regulatory measures 
the cost of our required implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act  including the man hours of our employees  during our fiscal year represents a one time significant addition to our selling  general and administrative expenses 
we believe the cost of continued testing and compliance during future fiscal years will be substantially less than that expended during fiscal 
table of contents the declining trend in interest expense as a percentage of total revenues is a function of the pay off of debt with our ipo proceeds and the impact of expiring interest rate swap agreements 
assuming that we are successful in continuing to generate positive cash flow  we expect interest expense to continue to decline as the last portion of our interest rate swaps expire in april  we believe our operating margin has stabilized in the to range as we continue to balance increased sales with operating costs 
the specific causes of these trend variations are discussed in detail under the comparison of operating results for the year ended january  to the year ended january  the presentation of our gross margins may not be comparable to other retailers since we include the cost of our in home delivery service as part of selling  general and administrative expense 
similarly  we include the cost of merchandising our products  including amounts related to purchasing the product  in selling  general and administrative expense 
it is our understanding that other retailers may include such costs as part of cost of goods sold

table of contents year ended january  compared to the year ended january  revenues 
total revenues grew by million  or  for the year ended january  when compared to the prior year  million of which was attributable to net sales increases and million was due to finance charges and other 
of the million increase in net sales  million was a result of new store sales during fiscal generated by nine retail locations that we opened in the last quarter of fiscal and in fiscal since these stores were not open for twelve consecutive months in both periods they were not included in same store sales numbers we expect to continue our expansion program by adding additional stores in existing markets as well as in new market areas  and we expect new store sales to be consistent with that presented for fiscal however  to the extent we continue to open new stores in existing markets  the same store sales for the existing stores in that market may suffer temporarily as they mature with their own customer base and demographics 
in fiscal  same store sales increased by million 
the net sales increase was influenced by an increase in service revenues of approximately  but reduced by million for discounting sales applicable to promotional credit programs with terms greater than one year to their fair value 
of the million change in product sales  approximately million was attributable to increases in unit sales and approximately million was attributable to increases in average unit price points 
most of the volume impact was due to appliances  mattresses and track sales  and price point impact was due mostly to consumers selecting higher priced products as new technology prices fall and become more affordable 
as reflected in the tables above and below  product sales and net sales are increasing at a somewhat lower rate than they did in fiscal years and this lower rate of growth resulted primarily from a continuing lower growth rate for same store sales 
however  we believe that we will continue to have same store sales increases by re merchandising our product offerings  training sales personnel to increase closing rates  regularly updating our stores  continuing to emphasize a high level of customer service  developing our track area and by supplementing our promotional no interest credit option with promotional periods greater than twelve months 
we expect that much of our future sales increases will continue to come from new stores and modest gains in same store sales 
the following table presents the makeup of net sales by product category in each period  including service maintenance agreement commissions and service revenues  expressed both in dollar amounts in thousands and as a percentage of total net sales 
years ended january  percentage increase decrease amount percent amount percent major home appliances consumer electronics track delivery and installation lawn and garden mattresses other total product sales service maintenance agreement commissions service revenues total net sales emphasis continues to be given to promotion of sales in the track area of computers  computer peripherals  portable electronics and small appliances 
the increases in lawn and garden and mattresses result from our increased emphasis placed on these relatively new product categories and the introduction of the serta brand mattresses to our product line 
there has been significant growth in the sales of furniture  primarily recliners and other seating products 
more square footage is being devoted to furniture in certain store locations as we continue to test the market for this product category 
the increase in fiscal year revenue from finance charges and other of approximately million resulted primarily from an increase in revenues of million from our securitization programs  a million 
table of contents increase in insurance commissions  including retrospective commissions  an increase in service maintenance agreement retrospective commissions of million  an increase in interest received on maintenance reserve funds of million  and an increase in interest received from receivables not sold of million 
we expect an increase in our securitization income as our sales increase 
the increase in securitization income resulted from greater asset transfers to the qspe due to increased retail sales and a higher credit penetration rate  as well as the inclusion of a portion of our promotional credit sales in the programs 
cost of goods and parts sold 
cost of goods sold  including warehousing and occupancy cost  increased by million  or  for the year ended january  this increase primarily resulted from the product sales increase as well as an increase in cost of retail products sold as a percentage of net product sales from in the period to in the period 
the overall increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of product sales was primarily caused by the continued deterioration of retail price points and sales of relatively lower margin computer products growing at a more rapid rate than sales of higher margin products 
we expect price deterioration to continue which will negatively impact gross product margins 
cost of parts sold increased approximately million  or  as service revenues increased slightly 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million or  for the year ended january  this increase was primarily the result of increased sales salaries and commissions and other payroll related expense  delivery  occupancy and depreciation expense due to the addition of new stores and all in line with the increase in net sales 
professional services was up which partially reflects the effect of complying with sarbanes oxley section by expending approximately  on direct implementation  including our independent accounting firms cost incurred in testing and preparation necessary to issue its initial report  but not including our employee man hours 
general liability  property and health insurance costs were up due to additional stores  additional employees primarily sales and the higher exposure of being a publicly traded company 
these cost increases were partially offset by decreases in telephone  amortization  advertising and equipment lease expense 
provision for bad debts 
the provision for bad debts increased by million or for the year ended january  primarily due to the increase in our average outstanding balance of our credit portfolio 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended january   to million for the year ended january  the decrease was attributable to the following the expiration of million of our interest rate hedges in april and the expiration of million of our interest rate hedges in november and the discontinuation of hedge accounting for derivatives resulted in a net decrease of million in interest expense from the prior period  and the decrease in our average outstanding debt from million to million when ignoring the impact of fin consolidation of million  see below as a result of our public offering and payoff of substantially all of our outstanding debt with the proceeds resulted in a decrease in interest expense of approximately million  these decreases were offset by the following the increase in interest rates in our continuing revolving debt facilities and related commitment fees of  and the implementation of fin resulted in reclassification of  in expenses previously reflected as occupancy cost in selling  general and administrative expense to interest expense  these reclassifications should not be necessary in the future since we are no longer subject to the provisions of fin minority interest 
as a result of fin  beginning february   we eliminate the pretax operating profit contributed from the consolidation of srds through the minority interest line item in our consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased by million  or  for the year ended january  the increase in the tax provision was directly related to the increase in pretax profits of million  or 
the effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations for the year ended january  was  compared with for the prior year 
taxes were comprised of federal and state rates totaling in both periods offset by cash refunds due to return amounts being lower than estimates and adjustments of previous tax provisions in both periods 
assuming that there are no changes in federal or state tax laws  it is expected that the effective tax rate for fiscal will return to approximately 
net income 
as a result of the above factors  net income increased by million  or  for the year ended january  net income available for common shareholders increased million  or  for the year ended january  year ended january  compared to year ended january  revenues 
total revenues increased by million for the year ended january  the increase was attributable to increases of million in net sales and million in finance charges and other 
of the million increase in net sales  million was generated by nine retail locations that were not open for twelve consecutive months in both periods and not included in our same store sales numbers 
same store sales increased million  or  for those stores that were open all twelve months in both periods 
increases in delivery and installation charges were partially offset by a decline in service revenues and accounted for the remaining million net sales increase 
the change in net sales was primarily due to increased unit volume of sales representing an increase of approximately million in sales that were offset by deteriorating price points that represent a decrease in sales of approximately million 
the addition of a second line of computers  increased sales in our track area  increased sales of our mattresses and lawn and garden product lines and a significant increase in projection television sales accounted for much of the increased unit volume of sales 
we believe that at least a portion of the smaller increase in same store sales was the result of a temporary negative impact on our existing stores caused by opening new stores in existing markets 
for example  after opening our sugarland store in the houston market in january  retail sales before service maintenance agreement cancellations in the market increased by during the year ended january  compared to the period  but our same store sales for the existing stores in this market that were open for a full twelve months in both periods increased only by 
likewise  our san antonio austin market experienced a total increase in retail sales as we opened four new stores in the area while our same store sales for our ten existing stores in this market increased only when compared to the period 
in addition  in an effort to reduce our delinquency rates  we increased down payment and verification requirements on certain of our credit accounts  which led to lower approval rates in the first six months of  and we modified the selection criteria for our direct mail program that effectively limited promotional credit and overall credit penetration in the same time frame  which resulted in fewer credit applications being processed as a percentage of sales 
during fiscal  we modified our down payment requirements  use of promotional credit and the selection criteria for our direct mail program to previous levels  which we believe increased our credit penetration while maintaining our historical delinquency and charge off rates 
as reflected in the tables above and below  product sales and net sales are increasing at a slower rate than they did in the past 
this slowing trend results primarily from a decline in same store sales within the last six months of fiscal and during fiscal  indicating that some of our stores may be reaching maturity as it relates to market penetration 
however  we believe that we positioned many of our stores  particularly those that have reached more mature levels  to have the potential for additional same store sales increases by re merchandising our product offerings  training sales personnel to increase closing rates  regularly updating our stores  continuing to emphasize a high level of customer service and developing our track area  we do expect that much of our future sales increases will continue to come both from existing stores and new stores

years ended january  percentage increase decrease amount percent amount percent major home appliances consumer electronics track delivery and installation lawn and garden mattresses other total product sales service maintenance agreement commissions service revenues total net sales the increase in net sales of consumer electronics is related primarily to increases in sales in projection televisions  liquid crystal display televisions and the introduction of the digital light processor big screen televisions 
the increase in track sales and other was due to the emphasis that was placed on these categories as significant components of same store sales growth 
the increase in delivery and installation revenues reflects growth in appliance and electronic unit sales and a price increase for delivery and installation charges 
the increases in lawn and garden and mattresses results from the emphasis placed on these product categories as significant components of same store sales growth 
the relatively smaller increase in service maintenance agreement sales reflects the impact of deteriorating price points of consumer electronic items and the increased consumer confidence in newer products  in addition  the modification of the sales commission program reduced the emphasis previously placed on this category of sales 
the decrease in service revenues is attributable to a more stringent review of claims made under our third party and company obligor service maintenance agreement programs for warranty repair services 
this decrease in service revenues was partially offset by increased retrospective commissions recorded in the line finance charges and other 
revenue from finance charges and other increased by approximately million for the year ended january  this increase in revenue resulted primarily from an increase in retrospective claim settlements of million  an increase in interest received on maintenance reserve funds of million  an increase in interest received from receivables not sold of million and an increase in insurance commissions of million 
these increases in revenues were offset by a decrease in securitization income of million 
the decrease in income from sale of receivables to the qspe of million resulted primarily from increased program costs of million and increased bad debts and other of million that were offset by additional interest income of million that was generated as a result of a increase in the credit portfolio 
increases in program costs resulted from the fixing of the interest rate on million in bonds and the increase in the credit portfolio 
additionally  during the period  we replaced a number of manual functions associated with the processing of non cash revenue adjustments in our credit control group with an auto post function 
while we were able to reduce personnel costs associated with this function  we experienced a one time revenue decrease of approximately million as we converted estimates to actual adjustments 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold  including warehousing and occupancy cost  increased by million for the year ended january  this increase primarily resulted from the net sales increase as well as an increase in cost of retail products sold as a percentage of net product sales from in the period to in the period 
the overall increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was primarily caused by the continued deterioration of retail price points and margins for consumer electronics products  over discounting in connection with the promotion of products for store grand openings in february and march and the entry into the dallas fort worth market  and sales of relatively lower margin computer products growing at a more rapid rate than sales of higher margin home appliance products 
while we believe 
table of contents that we have corrected the problems associated with higher discounting of prices  we do expect price deterioration to continue which will negatively impact gross product margins 
cost of parts sold decreased approximately million  or  as service revenues decreased as a result of lower warranty revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million for the year ended january  this increase was considerably less than the increase in total revenues as we began to focus on cost reductions  including salaries and payroll related costs  advertising and telephone expenses 
these cost reductions were partially offset by one time expenditures of approximately million associated with a change in methodology of calculating commissions for sales personnel and million for the settlement of a dispute with a former shareholder 
provision for bad debts 
the provision for bad debts increased by million for the year ended january  the increase in the bad debt provision resulted from a change in eligibility requirements under the new asset securitization program that we implemented in september  which resulted in our retaining a larger amount of receivables that had become ineligible for transfer to the qspe  as well as an increase in charge offs associated with our credit insurance and service programs 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million for the year ended january  the decrease was attributable to the following decreases in interest expense million due to a decrease in average outstanding debt from million in the period to million in the period  and million  net  resulting from the expiration of million of our interest rate hedges in april and the expiration of million of our interest rate hedges in november and the discontinuation of hedge accounting for  offset by an increase of approximately million due to increasing interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased by million for the year ended january  the increase in the tax provision was directly related to the increase in pretax profits of million  or and was offset by a cash refund from previously over provided income taxes of million 
the effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations for the two periods was consistent at 
however  the one time adjustment of the tax rate for the year ended january  for the cash refund of previously over provided income taxes resulted in a decrease in the current year effective tax rate to 
net income 
as a result of the above factors  net income increased by million for the year ended january  impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has a material effect on our net sales or results of operations 
however  a continuing significant increase in oil and gasoline prices could adversely affect our customers shopping decisions and patterns 
we rely heavily on our internal distribution system and our same or next day delivery policy to satisfy our customers needs and desires  and any such significant increases could result in increased distribution charges 
such increases may not affect our competitors in the same manner as it affects us 
seasonality and quarterly results of operations our business is somewhat seasonal  with a higher portion of sales and operating profit realized during the quarter that ends january the fiscal quarter ending january reflects the holiday selling season  the major collegiate bowl season  the national football league playoffs and the super bowl 
over the four quarters of fiscal  gross margins were   and 
during the same period  operating margins were   and 
a portion of the fluctuation in gross margins and operating margins is due to planned infrastructure cost additions  such as increased warehouse space and larger stores  additional personnel and systems required to absorb the significant increase in revenues that we have experienced over the last several years 
additionally  quarterly results may fluctuate materially depending on factors such as the following timing of new product introductions  new store openings and store relocations  sales contributed by new stores  increases or decreases in comparable store sales  
table of contents adverse weather conditions  shifts in the timing of certain holidays or promotions  and changes in our merchandise mix 
results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full year

we have historically financed our operations through a combination of cash flow generated from operations and external borrowings  including primarily bank debt and asset backed securitization facilities 
in december  we completed our ipo and received net proceeds of the offering of approximately million 
of this amount  approximately million was used to reduce then existing balance sheet debt 
at january   we had a revolving line of credit facility with a group of lenders in the amount of million  of which we had drawn approximately million and utilized million to issue letters of credit 
we expect that our cash requirements for the foreseeable future  including those for our capital expenditure requirements  will be met with our available line of credit  our existing million in cash and cash equivalents at january   together with cash generated from operations 
although not required  we may seek additional financing sources for new store expansions 

table of contents the following is a summary of our statement of cash flows for our fiscal years  and the decrease in cash flow from operating activities for fiscal year from fiscal year of million  resulted primarily from increased interest free promotional credit activity and net negative changes in working capital primarily due to increased inventory levels and payments of income taxes 
we anticipate continued credit promotions to drive retail sales  and  as a result  we expect to continue to experience lower amounts of cash flow generated from operating activities 
however  during fiscal  we successfully amended our asset backed securitization program to permit the inclusion of certain retail installment contracts and revolving charge agreement receivables  including our cash option and deferred interest receivables for terms up to thirty six months in the eligible asset base of our asset backed securitization financing arrangements  providing partial funding of these receivables 
while this should alleviate some of the drag on our cash flow from operating activities  we are pursuing additional financing of these types of receivables  which we believe will improve our cash flow 
our promotional credit programs offered to certain customers provide for same as cash interest free periods of varying terms  generally three  six  twelve  eighteen  twenty four or thirty six months 
these promotional accounts are eligible for securitization up to of eligible securitized receivables 
the percentage of eligible securitized receivables represented by promotional receivables was  and as january   and  respectively 
to the extent we exceed this limit  or to the extent we have such promotional credit receivables that do not qualify for inclusion in the programs  we are required to use our other capital resources to fund the unpaid balance of the receivables for the promotional period 
the weighted average promotional period was and months for promotional receivables outstanding as of january  and january   respectively 
the weighted average remaining term on those same promotional receivables was and months  respectively 
while overall these promotional receivables have a much shorter average weighted life than non promotional receivables  we receive less income as a result of a reduced net interest margin used in the calculation of the gain on the sale of the receivables 
as a result  the existence of the interest free extended payment terms negatively impacts the gains or losses as compared to the other receivables  and results in a decrease in our available cash 
net cash used by investing activities increased million  or  from million for the year ended january   to million for the year ended january  the increase in cash used resulted primarily from an increase in purchases of property and equipment 
the increase in cash expended for property and equipment resulted from the opening of five new stores in the dallas fort worth metroplex  and in the mcallen  texas markets  and the update and refurbishing of more existing stores than in the period 
additional increases to property and equipment resulted from the purchase of vehicles and other equipment rather than leasing 
based on current plans  we expect to open at least six to eight new stores and a distribution center in the dallas fort worth market and continue our store update program 
we estimate that capital expenditures for the fiscal year will approximate million to million 
we lease of our stores  and our plans for future store locations include primarily leases  but does not exclude store ownership 
our capital expenditures for future store projects should primarily be for our tenant improvements to the property leased including any new distribution centers and warehouses  the cost of which is approximately million per store  and for our existing store remodels  in the range of  per store remodel  depending on store size 
in the event we purchase existing properties  our capital expenditures will depend on the particular property and whether it is improved when purchased 
we are reviewing new relationship and funding sources and alternatives for new stores  which may include sale leaseback or direct purchase lease programs  as well as other funding sources for our purchase and construction of those projects 
if we are successful in these relationship developments  our direct cash needs should include only our capital expenditures for tenant improvements to leased properties and our remodel programs for existing stores 
net cash generated by financing activities increased million from million net cash provided during the year ended january   to million net cash provided during the year ended january  this change resulted primarily from the net borrowings under our bank credit facility and the proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
we do not expect to incur significant net borrowing or repayments under our bank credit facilities in fiscal we have amended our revolving credit facility to extend the maturity date to october   decrease the amount of the facility to million from million a year ago  and add a sublimit for standby letters of credit of million 
loans under our revolving credit facility may  at our option  bear interest at either the 
table of contents alternate base rate  which is the greater of the administrative agent s prime rate or the federal funds rate  or the adjusted libo libor rate for the applicable interest period  in each case plus an applicable interest margin 
the interest margin is between and for base rate loans and between and for libo libor alternative rate loans 
the applicable interest margin was for base rate loans and for libo libor alternative rate loans as of january  the interest margin will vary depending on our debt coverage ratio 
we make a practice of entering into underlying debt agreements that support the revolver portion of the credit facility for periods of three months or less 
we additionally pay commitment fees for the undrawn portion of our revolving credit facility 
at january  the interest rate on the revolving facility was 
in addition  the portion of each future receivable  based on its face amount  advanced in cash under the securitization program has been reduced from approximately in fiscal to approximately currently 
since this results in an increase in the retained balance of accounts receivable  we must finance this increase through sources other than the securitization program itself 
we have used  and will continue to require  a portion of our bank credit facility  and cash generated from operations to finance this increased level of accounts receivable 
a summary of the significant financial covenants that govern our bank credit facility compared to our actual compliance status at january  is presented below actual required minimum maximum debt service coverage ratio must exceed required minimum to to total leverage ratio must be lower than required maximum to to adjusted consolidated net worth must exceed required minimum charge off ratio must be lower than required maximum to to extension ratio must be lower than required maximum to to delinquency ratio must be lower than required maximum to to note all terms in the above table are defined by the bank credit facility and may or may not agree directly to the financial statement captions in this document 
events of default under the credit facility include  subject to grace periods and notice provisions in certain circumstances  non payment of principal  interest or fees  violation of covenants  material inaccuracy of any representation or warranty  default under or acceleration of certain other indebtedness  bankruptcy and insolvency events  certain judgments and other liabilities  certain environmental claims  and a change of control 
if an event of default occurs  the lenders under the credit facility are entitled to take various actions  including accelerating amounts due under the credit facility and requiring that all such amounts be immediately paid in full 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by all of our and our subsidiaries assets  excluding customer receivables owned by the qspe and certain inventory subject to vendor floor plan arrangements 
the following table reflects outstanding commitments for borrowings and letters of credit  and the amounts utilized under those commitments  as of january  commitment expires in fiscal year ending january  balance at january  available at january  thereafter total revolving bank facility unsecured line of credit inventory financing letters of credit total includes letter of credit sublimit 
there was million of letters of credit issued at january  included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as of january  since we extend credit in connection with a large portion of our retail  service maintenance and credit insurance sales  we created a qspe in to purchase customer receivables from us and to issue asset backed 
table of contents and variable funding notes to third parties to finance its purchase of these receivables 
we transfer receivables  consisting of retail installment contracts and revolving accounts extended to our customers  to the issuer in exchange for cash  subordinated securities and the right to receive the interest spread between the assets held by the qspe and the notes issued to third parties and our servicing fees 
the subordinated securities issued to us accrue interest based on prime rates and are subordinate to these third party notes both the bank credit facility and the asset backed securitization program are significant factors relative to our ongoing liquidity and our ability to meet the cash needs associated with the growth of our business 
our inability to use either of these programs because of a failure to comply with their covenants would adversely affect our continued growth 
funding of current and future receivables under the asset backed securitization program can be adversely affected if we exceed certain predetermined levels of re aging receivables  write offs  bankruptcies or other ineligible receivable amounts 
if the funding under the asset backed securitization program were reduced or terminated  we would have to draw down our bank credit facility more quickly than we have estimated 
a summary of the total receivables managed under the credit portfolio  including quantitative information about delinquencies  net credit losses and components of securitized assets  is presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
based on current operating plans  we believe that cash provided by operating activities  available borrowings under our credit facility  access to the unfunded portion of the variable funding portion of our asset backed securitization program and our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations  store expansion and updating activities and capital expenditure programs through at least january  however  there are several factors that could decrease cash provided by operating activities  including reduced demand for our products  more stringent vendor terms on our inventory purchases  increases in product cost that we may not be able to pass on to our customers  reductions in product pricing due to competitor promotional activities  increases in the retained portion of our receivables portfolio under our current asset backed securitization program as a result of changes in receivables performance  inability to expand our capacity for financing our receivables portfolio under new or replacement asset backed securitization programs or a requirement that we retain a higher percentage of the credit portfolio under such programs  increases in the program costs interest and administrative fees relative to our receivables portfolio associated with the funding of our receivables  increases in personnel costs required for us to stay competitive in our markets  and our inability to obtain a relationship to provide the purchase of and financing of our capital expenditures for our new stores 
if cash provided by operating activities during this period is less than we expect or if we need additional financing for future growth  we may need to increase our revolving credit facility or to undertake additional equity or debt offerings 
we may not be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms  if at all 
off balance sheet financing arrangements at january   the issuer has issued two series of notes a series a variable funding note with a capacity of million purchased by three pillars funding corporation and three classes of series b notes in the aggregate amount of million

private institutional investors  primarily insurance companies  purchased the series b notes 
the issuer used the proceeds of these issuances  along with funds provided by us in fiscal from borrowings under our bank credit facility  to initially purchase eligible accounts receivable from us and to fund a required million restricted cash account for credit enhancement of the series b notes 
we are entitled to a monthly servicing fee  so long as we act as servicer  in an amount equal to

suntrust capital markets  inc serves as an administrative agent for three pillars funding corporation in connection with the series a variable funding note 
the series a variable funding note permits the issuer to borrow funds up to million to purchase receivables from us  thereby functioning as a credit facility to accumulate receivables 
when borrowings under the series a variable funding note approach million  the issuer intends to refinance the receivables by issuing a new series of notes and to use the proceeds to pay down the outstanding balance of the series a variable funding note  so that the credit facility will once again become available to accumulate new receivables 
as of january   borrowings under the series a variable funding note were million 
the series a variable funding note matures on september  the issuer will repay the series a variable funding note and any refinancing note with amounts received from customers pursuant to receivables that we transferred to the issuer 
beginning on october   the issuer will begin to make scheduled principal payments on the series b notes with amounts received from customers pursuant to receivables that we transferred to the issuer

in addition  there is an annual administrative fee and a non use fee associated with the unused portion of the committed facility 
we are not directly liable to the lenders under the asset backed securitization facility 
if the issuer is unable to repay the series a and series b notes due to its inability to collect the transferred customer accounts  the issuer could not pay the subordinated notes it has issued to us in partial payment for transferred customer accounts  and the series b lenders could claim the balance in the restricted cash account 
we are also contingently liable under a million letter of credit that secures our performance of our obligations or services under the servicing agreement as it relates to the transferred assets that are part of the asset backed securitization facility 
the issuer is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants contained in the transaction documents governing the series a variable funding note and the series b notes  including covenants that restrict  subject to specified exceptions the incurrence of additional indebtedness and other obligations and the granting of additional liens  mergers  acquisitions  investments and disposition of assets  and the use of proceeds of the program

a summary of the total receivables managed under the credit portfolio  including information about delinquencies  net credit losses and components of securitized assets  is presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in an attempt to acquire retail lease space at more competitive rates  in we asked some members of our management team and the sgi affiliates to form specialized realty development services  lp  or srds  a real estate development company that would acquire land and develop projects for our purposes 
in order to encourage these members of management and the sgi affiliates to invest in srds  we entered into an arrangement with southtrust bank  na under which we guaranteed the construction debt of srds during the construction of these projects 
srds is owned by certain members of our management  including thomas j 
frank  sr  william c 
nylin  jr  c 
william frank  david r 
atnip  david w 
trahan  timothy l 
frank  robert b 
lee  jr  larry w 
coker and walter m 
broussard  and certain of the sgi affiliates 
while we did not own srds  we have been required to apply the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 or fin during fiscal years and  and have consolidated srds s balance sheet with ours as of january  and included its operations in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended january  we leased each completed project from srds as a retail store location for an initial period of years 
at the time each lease was executed  our guarantee for the construction portion of the real estate loan was released and the related assets and guaranty obligations were removed from our financial statements 
the lease then served as collateral for the loan to srds 
srds charged us annual lease rates of approximately of the total cost of each project  which averaged approximately  per year for each fiscal year from to  and totaled million during fiscal year in addition  we were responsible for the payment of all property taxes  insurance and common area maintenance expenses  which average approximately  per project per year 
we were required to fund all leasehold improvements made to the buildings 
based on independent appraisals performed on each project  we believe that the terms of the leases that have replaced the guaranty obligations were generally more favorable than we could obtain in an arms length transaction 
srds paid us an annual management fee of  for administrative services that we provided to srds 
as of january   we no longer lease any properties from srds 
on that date  srds completed the sale and disposition of its properties  subject to our leases  to ge commercial finance business property  or ge 
ge  by such acquisition  became our landlord under the existing leases of these properties 
as a result of the sale and the assumption by ge as landlord for our leases  we no longer have any relationship  directly or indirectly  to srds  and the provisions of fin relative to variable interest entities are no longer applicable to us 
consequently  our consolidated balance sheet at and following january  does not and will not include accounts of srds 
however  the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows included in our financial statements as of january  include srds operations  on a consolidated basis  through the dates of the completion of the respective sales 
the completion of the transaction by srds will have no effect on the ongoing operations of the company  as the company s existing leases remain in effect  with the new owner becoming the company s landlord 
however  since fin will no longer apply  we now classifies our lease payments made under these leases as lease expense  as we do all other operating leases  rather than as depreciation  interest and minority interest as was previously required to be reported under the provisions of fin certain transactions since  we have leased a retail store location of approximately  square feet in houston  texas from thomas j 
frank  sr  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
the lease provides for base monthly rental payments of  plus escrows for taxes  insurance and common area maintenance expenses of increasing monthly amounts based on expenditures by the management company operating the shopping center of which this store is a part through january  we also have an option to renew the lease for two additional five year terms 
mr 
frank received total payments under this lease of  in fiscal  and  respectively 
based on market lease rates for comparable retail space in the area  we believe that the terms of this lease are no less favorable to us than we could have obtained in an arms length transaction at the date of the lease commencement

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates under our bank credit facility are variable and are determined  at our option  as the base rate  which is the greater of prime rate or federal funds rate plus plus the base rate margin  which ranges from to  or libo libor plus the libo libor margin  which ranges from to 
accordingly  changes in the prime rate  the federal funds rate or libo libor  which are affected by changes in interest rates generally  will affect the interest rate on  and therefore our costs under  our bank credit facility 
we are also exposed to interest rate risk associated with our interest only strip and the subordinated securities we receive from our sales of receivables to the qspe 
see footnote to the audited financial statements for disclosures related to the sensitivity of the current fair value of the interest only strip and the subordinated securities to and adverse changes in the factors that affect these assets  including interest rates 
we held interest rate swaps and collars with notional amounts totaling million and million as of january  and january   respectively  with terms extending through april those instruments were held for the purpose of hedging against variable interest rate risk  primarily related to cash flows from our interest only strip as well as our variable rate debt 
in fiscal  hedge accounting was discontinued for million of those swaps  and in fiscal  hedge accounting was discontinued for the 
table of contents remaining million 
at the time the cash flow hedge designation was discontinued  we began to recognize changes in the fair value of the swaps as interest expense and to amortize the accumulated other comprehensive loss related to those derivates as interest expense over the period that the forecasted transactions effected the statement of operations 
during fiscal  we reclassified million of losses previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive losses into the statement of operations and recorded million into the statement of operations because of the change in fair value of the swaps 
during fiscal  we reclassified million of losses previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive losses into the statement of operations and recorded million into the statement of operations because of the change in fair value of the swaps 
during fiscal  we reclassified million of losses previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive losses into the statement of operations and recorded million into the statement of operations because of the change in fair value of the swaps 
prior to discontinuing these hedges  each period we recorded hedge ineffectiveness  which arose from differences between the interest rate stated in the derivative instrument and the interest rate upon which the underlying hedged transaction is based 
ineffectiveness totaled million and million  respectively for the years ended january  and  and is reflected in interest expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
since all hedge accounting has ceased  no ineffectiveness was recognized in fiscal
