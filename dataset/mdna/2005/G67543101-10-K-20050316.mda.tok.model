item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere 
we urge you to review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report  and those detailed from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission  that attempt to advise you of the risks and factors that may affect our future results 
part i item business overview we are one of the world s leading providers of software  applications and professional services for interactive and enhanced television 
we have traditionally provided the core software and related technologies that permit cable  satellite and digital terrestrial operators  which we refer to as network operators  television programmers and advertisers to offer viewers interactive and enhanced television experiences 
as of december   we had deployed our software solutions with network operators and had more than million digital set top boxes embedded with our software and technologies worldwide 
we also develop interactive applications for digital television that may be deployed with or without our middleware software 
our interactive software and applications allow our customers to differentiate their video service offerings and enhance viewer retention 
we believe they will also help enable the use of television for gaming  commerce  information retrieval  entertainment services and similar purposes 
our international footprint  with the millions of set top boxes in which our software is deployed  should also provide us  over time  with a strong foundation to develop revenue generating applications and other products that leverage off of that embedded software 
in addition  as we witness the distribution of digital content across multiple platforms  we have begun to extend our products  technologies and applications beyond the cable  satellite and digital terrestrial network operators with whom we have been traditionally engaged 
for example  we are developing technologies for internet protocol television  or iptv  for broadband network operators  including telecommunications and cable operators  we are also creating technology that enables our customers to distribute content and applications to consumers set top boxes  home networks and other devices  including portable and wireless devices 
our basic technologies enable network operators to manage the creation and delivery of interactive and enhanced television services to their subscribers across multiple models of set top boxes and within numerous network infrastructures 
we provide our technologies  interactive content and applications and professional services in more than countries 
major set top box manufacturers incorporate our software directly into over different set top box models  which allows our solutions to be easily activated by network operators upon deployment 
our core technology platform  which we refer to as middleware  permits network operators to maintain a consistent user experience for their subscribers irrespective of the set top box or boxes that may be deployed within a subscriber s home and the source of the video signal transmitted to that subscriber s home  whether transmitted by cable  satellite or terrestrial means  or  even  most recently  over i 
table of contents iptv 
our middleware also allows our customers  including programmers and advertisers  to develop applications once  without the need to rewrite those applications for different hardware environments  and offers network operators many other efficiencies in managing their business 
we continue to evolve our middleware to enhance the features that we offer 
we are developing enhancements to our personal video recorder  or pvr  solutions that retain interactive content for future playback simultaneously with the recorded broadcast 
we are also developing pvr enhancements that will enable recording of high definition television and distribution of protected content to other devices in the home network 
in addition  we offer applications that allow network operators to manage the trafficking and billing of their commercials  provide targeted and addressable advertising solutions and research technologies  which detail how viewers engage and interact with programs and advertisements  and enable viewers to engage in commerce transactions  retrieve information such as weather reports and sports updates  and other interactive services 
we also provide interactive gaming services  such as play for prizes and fixed odds gaming 
as part of our business  we also offer professional engineering and consulting services to help implement and coordinate the launch  integration and customization of the technologies and products that we provide 
we can manage entire interactive television projects  with complete end to end digital programming solutions  or simply provide assistance with discrete integration projects or development activities 
we believe that our extensive experience in the interactive television sector makes these services especially attractive to our customers as they seek to leverage our institutional knowledge and practical perspective 
in  we organized our engineering and marketing groups into two principal operating units our middleware and integrated technologies group  with responsibility for our middleware and the technologies that are customarily integrated as extensions of that middleware  and our applications group  with responsibility for our applications and related technologies and products 
we operate our bettingcorp uk ltd 
subsidiary  and its related companies  on a stand alone basis

over time  our middleware has been extended to support various integrated extensions  including on screen email  short messaging services  or sms  and chat services  interactive weather applications that permit viewers to obtain local weather information  as well as news  sports and enhanced programming 
we have also developed mosaic applications as extensions of our middleware that provide multiple camera angles and audio feeds delivered through a single television screen 
our mosaics have been used by operators to present events such as echostar communications corp 
s multi screen showcase for the summer olympics  which allowed echostar to provide viewers with a single screen that simultaneously displayed olympic events airing on various nbc networks  such as nbc  cnbc and msnbc 
our integrated technologies offer operators and programmers many other services that transform the conventional television into a more compelling source of information and entertainment 
we generally realize revenues through one time royalty payments and ongoing license fees 
we also may seek  in the future  to derive more of our revenues from those product offerings through subscriber based fee or revenue sharing arrangements 
as of december   we had deployed our software solutions and technologies to network operators throughout the world  and had more than million digital set top boxes embedded with our software and technologies 
in addition to the software and technologies that we integrate on set top boxes  we also offer technologies that are deployed at the network operator s head end 
we provide enterprise solutions that more effectively integrate the software in a set top box with the operator s  programmer s and advertiser s back end systems 
additionally  we have development tools that permit users to create  test and deliver interactive content and applications 
our middleware and integrated technologies consist of the following solutions opentv embedded set top box solutions 
our primary software offering has historically been installed mainly in set top boxes and serves as the gateway for delivering and managing interactive and enhanced television to viewers 
opentv embedded set top box solutions consist of opentv core and opentv device mosaic  as described below opentv core

opentv publisher 
opentv publisher works in conjunction with opentv streamer to enable content developers and network operators to use the popular web based extensible markup language  or xml  content format to build and deliver interactive content to set top boxes enabled with opentv core 
opentv streamer 
opentv streamer  the foundation of our headend solutions  enables network operators to integrate applications and data with audio and video signals for reception on set top boxes enabled with opentv core 
opentv streamer relies on hardware architecture that is capable of interfacing with any standard digital broadcast system 
opentv development tools and support for third party application developers 
we encourage content developers to design and create applications on opentv enabled networks by offering a series of applications development tools and support tool sets enabling them to develop and market applications directly to network operators 
the tools can be used alone or in combination with other third party tools to meet virtually any interactive television development need  such as creating virtual channels  building interactive advertisements  enhancing existing programs with interactive features and testing interactive television content through a simulated broadcast environment 
in addition  we offer participation in our opentv partner program to the licensees of our development tools 
through participation  members gain access to various resources including opportunities to participate in beta programs for early release of products as well as opportunities for exposure on our website and at various trade conferences 
applications business we develop and provide interactive applications that permit targeted and addressable advertising  traffic and billing solutions for the delivery of advertisements by network operators  purchase and sales transactions i 
table of contents through a viewer s remote control  requests for information from advertisers or programmers in real time as the viewer sees the advertisement or television program and audience and media research capabilities to determine viewing preferences 
we have also developed and operated branded interactive television channels that are distributed by network operators utilizing opentv core or interactive television middleware platforms provided by third parties 
we generally realize revenues through license and other fees and revenue sharing arrangements 
we believe that the worldwide deployment of set top boxes embedded with our software solutions provides us with a strong foundation to develop applications and other products that leverage off of that platform 
double c technologies  llc  a joint venture formed by two north american cable network operators  cox communications  inc and comcast corporation  recently announced its proposed acquisition of substantially all of the assets of liberate technologies north american business  including liberate s middleware platform which has historically competed directly with opentv core 
while that transaction  if it closes  may materially diminish our opportunity to license middleware to cox and comcast  we believe that the transaction may also evidence a continuing emphasis by network operators to direct more focus and efforts on the potential value that interactivity and enhanced television can offer their subscribers 
we believe that the continued evolution of the interactive market by large network operators such as cox  comcast  unitedglobalcom and echostar  the ongoing efforts of british sky broadcasting  or bskyb  foxtel and other news corporation affiliates  and various programmers  should enhance the overall market for interactive and enhanced television solutions over time  and  possibly  lead to additional opportunities for us to develop interactive applications 
our applications business consists of the following solutions opentv enhanced content 
we provide interactive applications for programmers and network operators that deliver compelling interactive content 
in november  for example  we extended a multi year agreement with in demand to produce nascar races through nascar in car on in demand 
nascar in car is a multi channel television package that uses a mix of digital compression technology  real time telemetry data and superior graphics to give subscribers seven in car camera channels  and live team audio  data and driver statistics 
in demand distributes this programming on a pay per view basis through certain digital cable systems in the united states 
opentv advertising solutions 
we provide software solutions to enable the sales  integration  delivery and management of advertising for digital television systems 
opentv advertising solutions are being developed to provide our customers with an integrated solution to address challenges being experienced by the advertising market 
those changes include the migration of television viewers to the internet  channels of disparate content and time shifting of viewing activity due to the introduction of pvrs 
our products are intended to offer advertisers the ability to target advertisements with more specificity to viewers based on a variety of demographic and other information and the ability to sell  manage  bill and deliver multiple advertisements across an operator s network 
they are also intended to offer customers an ability to assess the effectiveness of those types of advertisements and related matters 
the market for these types of solutions remains undeveloped  and there are many issues that will need to be resolved over time  including issues of privacy  before these solutions become extensively deployed 
opentv advertising solutions currently consist of opentv advision and opentv spoton  which are described below opentv advision 
opentv advision is an advertising traffic and billing system that manages various media platforms and outlets  simultaneously providing network operators the tools to manage local cable television  cable networks  and proprietary broadband networks by scheduling the display of advertising  monitoring the display of advertising  and billing the advertisers based upon such monitoring 
opentv spoton 
opentv spoton enables network operators to offer addressable advertising that can be delivered to particular households based on individual profiles 
opentv spoton is not dependent on a network operator deploying opentv s middleware solutions 
advertisers have the i 
table of contents ability to develop different ads for the same product or service that are designed for specific audiences  ensuring that the message appeals to all of the audience for the commercial 
different advertising messages are then simultaneously targeted to households through the use of technology that permits set top boxes to seamlessly jump between video signals  thereby invisibly tailoring the video experience to the profile of the viewing household 
with this technology  a network operator can  for example  deliver an advertisement for a pick up truck to one household while simultaneously delivering an advertisement  in the same interval  for a sedan or sports coupe to a different household based on demographic profiles  and can measure and track each addressable spot and receive valuable aggregate viewer data  enabling advertisers to build profiles  and help drive improved analysis and research for future marketing and planning 
we carefully review and assess  with our customers  the privacy issues associated with this type of product  and expect to deploy this product in a manner that addresses the various privacy laws  regulations and practices that are evolving in the sector 
playjam 
playjam is one of the world s first multi platform interactive television entertainment and games channels 
we offer a library of more than different single or multi player games that can run on playjam 
these include quizzes  arcade style games  puzzles  adult theme games  and competition and editorial games 
a wide selection of these games can be customized and used as unique branding vehicles 
launched in early on the bskyb s network in the united kingdom  playjam currently is available to over million subscribers through distribution on bskyb  cable operators ntl group ltd 
and telewest broadband in the united kingdom  satellite operators television par satellite tps and canal satellite in france  multichoice africa in africa  and satellite operator echostar communications in the united states 
playjam runs on the opentv platform as well as those provided by other middleware providers 
in the united kingdom and france  playjam charges a fee  via a premium rate telephone call using the telephone or the remote control  for membership registration  game score registration for the chance to win prizes  and for access to pay per play content 
we have also sold advertising and sponsorship space from time to time on playjam games 
in the united states  playjam is offered as a subscription based service on echostar  for which we receive a revenue share 
bettingcorp business we acquired bettingcorp in bettingcorp manages a branded interactive television gaming channel under the name playmontecarlo and also offers play for prizes and casino games 
bettingcorp also has a technology platform called ultimate one which allows licensees to deliver games seamlessly across television  the internet and wireless devices through a proprietary back end system 
play for prizes and casino games applications 
subject to local laws and regulations and based on the licenses bettingcorp holds  we are able to offer fixed odds and casino gaming services 
playmontecarlo is one of the world s first interactive television play for prizes and gaming channels 
ultimate one platform 
with our ultimate one technology platform  we can enable network operators  programmers  wireless carriers and others to offer various games and products across multiple media platforms  including television  internet and wireless networks  using a single  integrated back end management system 
ultimate one also provides an integrated back end management system that enables operators to monitor usage of the games  tailor promotions on an individual basis and evaluate usage and other metrics in real time 
this platform  for example  allows a subscriber to initiate an account through a cable operator  play games through that cable operator s network  and then sign off and reinitiate that same game  in the same state  on a mobile telephone with single account sign on 
we believe that this technology will help to extend our interactive and participation offerings beyond the television environment  and will enable us to offer customers a seamless interactive platform for their subscribers 
we expect  in  to begin marketing this product to network operators and other potential customers  including programmers  independent of the play for prizes and casino games business that bettingcorp also conducts 
by doing this  we would expect to provide the underlying technology and services that would permit other companies to leverage their brand and marketing experience and offer interactive applications across multiple platforms

in  we reorganized our business in an effort to address our customers needs more effectively 
we have established regional operating groups that are responsible for customers within their geographic areas north american satellite  north american cable  europe  middle east and africa  and asia pacific 
competition the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
current and potential competitors in one or more aspects of our business include digital television technology companies and i 
table of contents companies developing interactive television content and applications 
the principal competitive factors in our industry include product functionality  speed of product integration  breadth of network and platform coverage  scalability  price  possession of adequate intellectual property rights and sales and marketing efforts 
the following is a competitive analysis of our business segments 
middleware and integrated technologies our competitors offering interactive television enabling technology include nds group  microsoft corporation  liberate technologies  osmosys  access co  ltd 
and scientific atlanta  inc nds group historically provided conditional access and limited interactive application technologies to its customers 
in  nds extended its interactive services offerings with its acquisition of mediahighway from thomson multimedia and has begun to offer solutions that are more directly competitive with many of those that we offer 
nds group is controlled by the news corporation 
the news corporation maintains a controlling stake in hughes electronics  the parent of directv  one of the two largest satellite operators in the united states 
the news corporation also controls bskyb  the largest satellite operator in the united kingdom  and sky italia  the largest satellite operator in italy  and two of our most significant customers  and other satellite operators throughout the world 
while we continue to work with  and provide technology and services to many affiliates of the news corporation  including bskyb  foxtel and sky italia  the news corporation s control of nds group  and the extension by nds group of its product offering  may significantly increase competitive pressures and affect the willingness of other news corporation affiliates to work with us or to obtain products or services from us 
we cannot  therefore  be certain of the long term implications related to the news corporation s control of nds group or the effects that such control may have upon our relationships and opportunities to work with the many satellite operators throughout the world that are controlled by the news corporation 
for several years  microsoft corporation has been working to create interactive television solutions 
microsoft has several deployments of its interactive television solution and we expect that microsoft may become a strong competitor in the market for interactive television solutions 
liberate technologies manufactures and licenses its software to network operators and set top box manufacturers and has announced relationships with several united states and united kingdom cable operators 
on january   liberate announced it had reached an agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of its north american business to double c technologies  llc  a joint venture between comcast and cox 
the closing of this acquisition is subject to customary conditions  including regulatory approval 
assuming that double c technologies acquires liberate s north american assets  it is unclear whether double c will only develop that technology for the benefit of comcast and cox or whether it will attempt to sell that technology and related products to other cable operators in competition with opentv 
scientific atlanta  inc  in the form of powertv  develops and markets operating system and middleware software products for the advanced digital interactive cable television markets 
scientific atlanta is also a major manufacturer of set top boxes  and many of our customers or potential customers may seek to deploy set top boxes manufactured by scientific atlanta 
we have in the past competed with scientific atlanta and expect to continue to do so in the future 
in the iptv market  we expect to face competition from other middleware providers and providers of end to end iptv solutions for cable  satellite and telecommunications operators 
providers offering end to end iptv solutions include microsoft  which recently announced its new iptv platform microsoft tv iptv edition for cable and telecommunications operators  and alcatel which provides both iptv middleware and broadband networking hardware 
microsoft announced licensing arrangements in late with sbc communications and verizon communications for its iptv solution  and also recently announced a partnership with alcatel to develop and market jointly an iptv solution 
other competitive iptv offerings that deliver middleware solutions and or iptv solutions through partnerships include those from myrio  and orca interactive 
in the pvr field  our primary competition comes from other middleware vendors including microsoft  nds group  guideworks llc  a joint venture of comcast and gemstar tv guide international  osmosys  digeo and ucentric  which was recently acquired by motorola  who include pvr functionality either with i 
table of contents their electronic program guide  or epg  or as an additional feature 
other pvr technology providers targeting the integrated pvr space include set top box manufacturers pioneer  pace  motorola and scientific atlanta  and dedicated pvr solution providers including tivo and replaytv 
applications in the markets for enhanced television technology and services  addressable and interactive advertising technology  and advertising traffic and billing solutions  our primary competition comes from companies such as visible world corporation  nds group  encoda systems and cams systems 
addressable and interactive technology is in its initial stages  and we expect additional competitors to appear as the market continues to develop 
visible world provides a suite of services enabling a media outlet to develop and deliver content and advertising that can be geographically and demographically customized as well as dynamically updated based on business parameters  market trends and demands 
our interactive applications face competition from numerous parties 
companies that compete with our efforts to develop and launch applications on our middleware platform include dedicated applications providers such as gemstar tv guide international  nds group  visiware  goldpocket and metatv  independent third parties that develop and provide applications for our middleware platform  and other middleware providers such as microsoft 
we also face competition from media companies that have publicly announced interactive television initiatives  such as the discovery channel  espn  time warner cable and cnn 
in addition  certain network operators such as bskyb in the united kingdom have entered into agreements  joint ventures  and other relationships with technology and entertainment companies 
we expect competition in the interactive content and applications area to intensify as the general market for interactive television services further develops  particularly in the case of independent third parties that have the ability to develop applications for our middleware platform at relatively modest expense through the use of our applications development tools 
bettingcorp while interactive television betting and gaming may provide a future source of potential growth  we also expect to face intense competition in jurisdictions in which we are permitted to deploy those product offerings 
companies with which we expect to compete include bskyb and fancy a flutter 
because this aspect of interactive television remains nascent  we cannot be certain as to how competition will develop or the precise nature of the competitors that we may expect to encounter 
because of the significant regulatory issues affecting this sector and the benefits derived from operating under that regulatory framework over a long period  we may also face competition in the future from more traditional casino companies with long histories in the betting and gaming sector 
regulations the telecommunications  media  broadcast and cable television industries are subject to extensive regulation by governmental agencies around the world 
these governmental agencies continue to oversee and adopt legislation and regulation over these industries  particularly in the areas of user privacy  consumer protection  the online distribution of content and the characteristics and quality of online products and services  which may affect our business  the development of our products  the decisions by market participants to adopt our products and services or the acceptance of interactive television by the marketplace in general 
ongoing efforts to establish industry wide standards for interactive television software include a commitment by cable network operators in the united states to deploy a uniform platform for interactive television based on a jointly developed specification known as the open cable applications platform and an initiative by european television industry participants to create a similar platform called multimedia home platform  or mhp 
the establishment of these standards or other similar standards could adversely affect the pricing of our products and services  significantly reduce the value of our intellectual property and the competitive advantage our proprietary technology provides  cause us to incur substantial expenditures to adapt i 
table of contents our products or services to respond to these developments  or otherwise hurt our business  particularly if our products require significant redevelopment in order to conform to the newly established standards 
if  and to the extent that  we continue to develop applications for the gaming and betting market  we also expect to become subject to additional regulatory oversight 
the laws and regulations in this market are quickly evolving and changing 
to adequately address the legal and regulatory issues inherent in that market  we will need to dedicate significant resources to those matters and maintain effective controls to monitor changes in applicable laws and the effects on our business 
intellectual property and research and development as of december   we had patents issued in the united states  patents issued outside of the united states  and patent applications pending throughout the world 
we believe that our patent portfolio protects many of the key elements necessary to support digital interactive television 
our research and development expenses  excluding in process research and development charges related to acquisitions  and amortization of share based compensation  for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively

the lawsuit is pending in the united states district court for the northern district of california 
on march   liberate technologies filed a counterclaim against opentv  inc for alleged infringement of four patents allegedly owned by liberate technologies

although we are still evaluating the impact of liberate s sale of its north american business on our lawsuit  we continue to believe that our lawsuit is meritorious and intend to continue vigorously pursuing prosecution of our claims 
in addition  we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the counterclaims brought against opentv  inc and will defend ourselves vigorously 
no provision has been made in our consolidated financial statements for this matter

litigation relating to the acquisition of actv  inc on november   a purported class action complaint was filed in the court of chancery of the state of delaware in and for the county of new castle against actv  inc  its directors and us

segment information appearing below in this discussion and analysis  and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
overview we are one of the world s leading providers of software and solutions for interactive and enhanced television 
we generally derive our revenues from the licensing of our core software and related technologies  the licensing and distribution of our content and applications and the delivery of professional services 
we have traditionally received one time royalty fees from manufacturers or network operators upon notification of shipment or activation of our software in set top boxes and other products 
we receive professional services fees from consulting  engineering and training engagements and fees for the maintenance and support of our products 
we receive fees or revenue shares  or both  for our playjam games channel  our playmontecarlo channel  which is managed by bettingcorp  and advertising and other interactive services 
our financial results are largely dependent upon the continued development of the digital television market and the related capital expenditures being made and which we expect will be made in the future by network operators to implement those enhanced technologies 
with the distribution of digital content evolving across multiple platforms  we have begun to extend our products  technologies and applications beyond the cable  satellite and terrestrial network operators with whom we have been traditionally engaged  and anticipate offerings that would be marketed to other industry participants  including telecommunications companies 
there has been a worldwide trend of consolidation in the cable and satellite industries 
we believe this trend is likely to continue due to economic and competitive concerns 
it also appears that it has begun to include other companies involved with the interactive television industry 
for example  last year the news corporation acquired a controlling stake in hughes electronics  the parent of directv  one of the two largest satellite operators in the united states 
the news corporation also controls bskyb  the largest satellite operator in the united kingdom  and sky italia  the largest satellite operator in italy  two of our most significant customers  and other satellite operators throughout the world 
it also controls one of our competitors  nds group 
in january  liberate technologies  a direct competitor of ours in the middleware business  announced that it had reached agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of its north american business to double c technologies  llc  a joint venture formed by comcast and cox 
these types of consolidation  and similar trends in the industry  may affect our long term relationships with existing customers and may also affect our ability to obtain business in the future 
while the short and long term effects of this trend remain uncertain  they may require us to modify our business to adapt to those changing relationships with industry participants and to address competitive concerns that may arise as companies consolidate 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  we made our best estimates and judgments  which are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events  giving due consideration to materiality 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
ii 
table of contents we believe the following critical accounting estimates have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  valuation allowances  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred tax assets  valuation of investments in privately held companies  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  and restructuring costs 
all of these accounting policies  estimates and assumptions  as well as the resulting impact to our financial statements  have been discussed with our audit committee 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  that have been prescribed for the software industry  the principal policies of which are reflected in american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition 
revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and are subject to change 
our revenue recognition policy is one of our critical accounting policies because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and is based on complex rules that require us to make judgments and estimates 
the application of sop requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists 
in applying our revenue recognition policy  we must determine what portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred 
in order to determine current and deferred revenue  we make judgments and estimates with regard to future deliverable products and services and the appropriate pricing for those products and services 
our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services could differ from actual events 
professional services revenues from software development contracts  customization services and implementation support are recognized generally on the percentage of completion method 
for fixed bid contracts under the percentage of completion method  the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on actual costs incurred to total estimated costs 
the actual results could differ from the percentage estimates by the time a project is completed 
the recognition of revenues is partly based on our assessment of the probability of collection of the resulting accounts receivable balance 
as a result  the timing or amount of revenue recognition may have been different if different assessments of the probability of collection of accounts receivable had been made at the time the transactions were recorded in revenue 
valuation allowances we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider our potential future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of our valuation allowance 
currently  we maintain a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities 
adjustments may be required in the future if we determine that an amount of deferred tax assets should be realizable 
valuation of investments in privately held companies we invest in equity and debt instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic objectives  and typically we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate the inherent market risks of these investments 
we perform periodic reviews of these investments for impairment 
our investments in privately held companies are considered impaired when a review of the investee s operations and other indicators of impairment indicate that there has been a decline in the fair value that is other than temporary and that the carrying value of the investment is not likely to be recoverable 
such indicators include  but are not limited to  ii 
table of contents limited capital resources  need for additional financing  and prospects for liquidity of the related securities 
impaired investments in privately held companies are written down to estimated fair value  which is the amount we believe is recoverable from the investment 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets our long lived assets include goodwill and other intangible assets  which are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and  in the case of goodwill  annually 
in assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets  we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
the biggest assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is revenue growth 
estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments that can be significantly impacted by changes in global and local business and economic conditions  operating costs  competition and demographic trends 
if our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
restructuring costs we monitor our organization structure and associated operating expenses periodically 
depending upon events and circumstances  actions may be taken to restructure the business  including terminating employees  abandoning excess lease space and incurring other exit costs 
any resulting restructuring costs include numerous estimates made by us based on our knowledge of the activity being affected and the cost to exit existing commitments 
these estimates could differ from actual results 
we monitor the initial estimates periodically and record an adjustment for any significant changes in estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting board fasb recently enacted statement of financial accounting standards revised sfas r  share based payment  which replaces statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires the measurement of all employer share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of income 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june  we are required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net loss and net loss per share amounts  for through  as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will be result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expect the adoption to have a significant impact on our consolidated statements of income 
management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls in connection with the preparation of our year end financial statements  we have prepared a report  as required by the sarbanes oxley act of  which evaluates our internal control over financial reporting as of december  that complete report  as well as our conclusions regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure control and our remediation efforts  is included under item a of this annual report on form k  which investors should read in its entirety 
we are required to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules a f and d f under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
those controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
and ii 
table of contents while those controls may be expected to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of our financial reporting  we do not expect that such controls will prevent all error and fraud 
we monitor our controls and maintain those controls as dynamic systems that change including improvements and corrections as conditions warrant 
we also maintain a system of disclosure controls that have been designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file under the securities exchange act  including this annual report on form k  is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the securities and exchange commission 
as we assessed our internal control over financial reporting  we have sought to identify various deficiencies or weaknesses that we may have and to correct those deficiencies or weaknesses as promptly as practicable 
we are required to disclose any material weaknesses that we have identified 
the public company accounting oversight board  which was established under the sarbanes oxley act  defines a material weakness as a significant deficiency  or combination of significant deficiencies  that results in there being more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by employees in the normal course of their assigned functions 
on those bases  our management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of december  certain duties within our financial group  which has the responsibility for preparing our financial statements  were not properly segregated 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that our controller had the ability to direct other personnel within the finance group to initiate and enter manual journal entries in the company s books and records without authorization or review by other members of the financial organization 
after identifying this weakness  we introduced new procedures in the first quarter of requiring that our chief financial officer review any and all non recurring journal entries with a value of  or more and also required that our chief financial officer review all journal entries that are directed by our controller  including those below  we believe that the remediating and compensating controls that we initiated in the first quarter of have effectively remediated this weakness 
in addition to that weakness  we determined that certain controls associated with our financial review and close process were not effective 
as we began our closing process in the fourth quarter and the work for our year end audit  we determined that we had inadequate supporting documentation for an accrual in our financial statements  which resulted in an error that was identified and subsequently corrected 
we also concluded that our review of certain detailed schedules prepared in connection with our financial reporting process  which we use to support our financial statements and related note disclosures  was not effective 
that weakness led to errors in the statement of cash flows  lease commitments and tax notes of our financial statements that were identified and subsequently corrected 
and we also concluded  as a result of this evaluation  that we did not have sufficient internal personnel and technical expertise to properly apply accounting principles to certain non routine matters  in particular  we applied certain provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangibles sfas no 
in an incorrect manner when conducting our annual analysis for potential impairment of goodwill  which led to an error that was identified and subsequently corrected 
at the start of this year  we began implementing additional procedures to ensure that all necessary and relevant supporting documentation for accrual balances is properly collected and analyzed and to also ensure a more thorough review of our close process 
we are also evaluating our personnel  developing a plan to enhance the current staff s capabilities and assessing whether additional resources with appropriate accounting knowledge and experience are required to further remediate these issues 
ii 
table of contents we corrected all errors described above prior to the issuance of the audited financial statements that are included in this annual report on form k 
based on those evaluations and findings  however  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december  although we have received an unqualified audit report from our independent registered public accounting firm  kpmg llp  on our consolidated financial statements  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that  as a result of those material weaknesses  our disclosure controls  as of december   were not effective

we generally derive royalties from the sale of set top boxes and other products that incorporate our software to manufacturers and network operators around the world typically  as one time payments for each license 
we recognize royalties upon notification of unit shipments or activation of our software by manufacturers or network operators 
royalty reports are generally received one quarter in arrears 
for non refundable prepaid royalties  we recognize revenues upon delivery of the software 
royalties for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million in growth was experienced in all regions in europe  middle east and africa had an increase of million  or  from  of which shipments to sky italia accounted for an increase of million 
americas had an increase of million  or  from due to strong shipments by echostar 
asia pacific had an increase of million  or  from  which was almost entirely due to shipments of our integrated browser in certain digital tv sets distributed within japan 
in certain instances  we provide volume discounts to customers based on the number of copies of our software that they deploy 
as a result of those types of arrangements  although we may experience continued growth in middleware deployments  the average price for each copy licensed to certain customers may decline over time  which could limit the growth of our royalty payments in the future 
if current deployment trends continue in a manner consistent with those of  we would expect the average pricing for our middleware  over the course of  to decline for certain customers

impairment and amortization of intangible assets and goodwill 
intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of to years 
amortization of developed technologies was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  amortization of patents was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  these amounts have been included in the consolidated statements of operations as cost of revenues 
amortization of other intangible assets was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the decrease of million for compared with was due primarily to the expiration of the amortization period for certain intangibles 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that an impairment of million had occurred in the value of patents related to our acquisition of cablesoft due to the absence of any current or future expected cash flow associated with the cablesoft technologies 
in the third quarter of  we determined that an impairment of million had occurred in the value of the patents related to our openstar joint venture with echostar due to the absence of any current or future expected cash flow generated by the joint venture 
in accordance with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we re evaluated the amount recorded as goodwill as of january  and determined that a transitional impairment of million had occurred 
this amount has been shown as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the consolidated statements of operations 
in the third quarter of  due to reductions by network operators in their capital spending and rollout of interactive television related products and similar reductions by other customers  we revised our cash flow projections for the remainder of calendar year and future years 
based on these cash flow projections and other factors  including the decline in the market price of our class a ordinary shares  we determined that the remaining goodwill was impaired  and  accordingly  wrote off the balance of million in interest income due to a decrease in our investment portfolio  interest income for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   there was a decline in interest rates in the united states coupled with a decrease in our investment portfolio from the sale of investment securities both to support our operations and to finance our ii

historically  we made various equity investments in  and loans to  certain privately held companies 
most of these companies subsequently experienced severe cash flow problems  and we found it necessary to write down the value of our private equity investments

our income tax benefit was million for the year ended december   which included credits of million primarily due to tax refunds in the united kingdom  a favorable settlement of a tax audit in france  and the reversal of a federal and state tax liability previously recorded by an acquired company following the expiration of the statute of limitations  offset by a provision of million for foreign and state taxes 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  business segment results in  we redefined our internal financial reporting to better align our financial analysis with our current businesses 
our management assesses our results and financial performance  and prepares our internal budgeting reports  on the basis of three segments the middleware and integrated technologies business  the applications business  and the bettingcorp business 
we have prepared this segment analysis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
our middleware and integrated technologies business has responsibility for our middleware and the technologies that are customarily integrated as extensions of that middleware 
our applications business has responsibility for our applications and related technologies and products 
our bettingcorp business has responsibility for fixed odds and other wagering gaming applications and the development  operation and marketing of our ultimate one platform 
our management reviews and assesses the contribution margin of each of these segments  which is not a financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
we define contribution margin  for these purposes  as adjusted ebitda before unusual items and unallocated corporate overhead  which includes certain functions  such as executive management  accounting  administration  legal  tax  treasury and information technology infrastructure  that support but are not specifically attributable to our operating segments expense 
ebitda is an acronym for earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ii 
table of contents adjusted ebitda before unusual items is a non gaap financial measure which excludes interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  amortization of intangible assets  share based compensation  impairment of goodwill  impairment of intangibles  other income  minority interest  restructuring provisions  and unusual items such as contract amendments that mitigated potential loss positions 
adjusted ebitda before unusual items does not take into account substantial costs of doing business  such as income tax and interest 
management believes that segment contribution margin is a helpful measure in evaluating operational performance for our company 
while we may consider contribution margin and adjusted ebitda before unusual items to be important measures of comparative operating performance  these measures should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  loss from operations  net loss  cash flow used in operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states that are otherwise presented in our financial statements 
in addition  our calculations of contribution margin and adjusted ebitda before unusual items may be different from the calculations used by other companies and  therefore  comparability may be affected 
because these segments reflect the manner in which management reviews our business  they necessarily involve judgments that management believes are reasonable in light of the circumstances under which they are made 
these judgments may change over time or may be modified to reflect new facts or circumstances 
segments may also be changed or modified to reflect technologies and applications that are newly created  or that change over time  or other business conditions that evolve  each of which may result in reassessing specific segments and the elements included within each of those segments 
revenues by segment were as follows in millions year ended december  middleware and integrated technologies royalties services  support and other license fees subtotal applications fees and revenue shares services  support and other license fees subtotal bettingcorp fees and revenue shares total revenues from the middleware and integrated technologies business for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million in for the year ended december   revenues from the middleware and integrated technologies business were million  an increase of million  or  from million in the two major components of revenues for this segment are royalties and services and support 
royalties from set top boxes and other products that incorporate our software accounted for of segment revenues in  an increase from in and in the increase in was primarily attributable to significant shipments to sky italia and other customers as described under royalties above 
services  support and other consists primarily of professional services consulting engagements for set top box manufacturers  network operators and system integrators and maintenance  support and training 
this category accounted for of segment revenues in  a decrease from in and in the decrease was due to fewer professional services projects  especially from motorola in ii

contribution loss for the applications business improved significantly from to ii 
table of contents due mostly to reduced operating expenses 
contribution loss for the bettingcorp business increased from to as a result of bettingcorp s inclusion in our financial results for the full year in liquidity and capital resources we expect to be able to fund our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months by using existing cash balances and short term and long term marketable debt securities  if our assumptions about our revenues  expenses and cash commitments are generally accurate 
because we cannot be certain that our assumptions about our business or the interactive television market in general will prove to be accurate  our capital requirements may differ from our current expectations

cash and cash equivalents as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
taking into account short term and long term marketable debt securities of million  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities were million as of december  compared to million as of december  and million as of december  our cash balances as of december   were positively affected by our receipt of million in cash from the sale by the former owners of bettingcorp of opentv shares they had received in the acquisition of bettingcorp at a price above that which the company had guaranteed and the release from escrow of million that had previously secured our obligations under that price guarantee we had provided bettingcorp

table of contents commitments and contractual obligations information as of december  concerning the amount and timing of required payments under our contractual obligations is summarized below in millions payments due by period due in due in due in due in or total after operating leases obligations noncancelable purchase obligations total contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business  we enter into various arrangements with vendors and other business partners for bandwidth  marketing  and other services 
minimum commitments under these arrangements as of december  were million and million for the years ending december  and  respectively 
in addition  we also have arrangements with certain parties that provide for revenue sharing payments 
as of december   we had two standby letters of credit aggregating approximately million that were issued to landlords at two of our leased properties 
in march  we entered into a licensing and distribution agreement with sun microsystems  inc under which sun microsystems granted us a non exclusive  non transferable license to develop and distribute products based upon sun microsystems java technology 
subsequent amendments extended our license through december as amended  the agreement requires us to make a payment of million to sun microsystems in february  less any amounts previously paid for support and royalty fees 
during  we evaluated our commitment and decided to record a provision of million to reflect our estimate of the remaining future commitment we have under the terms of this license 
indemnification in the normal course of our business  we provide indemnification to customers  subject to limitations  against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products 
historically  costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations  although our liabilities in those arrangements are customarily limited in various respects  including monetarily 
as permitted under the laws of the british virgin islands  we have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is not material 
factors that may affect future results in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form k  you should consider carefully the following factors in evaluating opentv and our business 
we have a history of net losses  and we may continue to experience net losses in the future 
we have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
our net losses for the years ended december   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing  product development and administrative expenses and expect to continue to suffer net losses in the near term 
we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve and maintain profitability 
we cannot be certain that we will achieve  sustain or ii 
table of contents increase profitability in the future 
any failure to significantly increase revenue as we implement our product and distribution strategies would adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we have historically derived a significant percentage of our revenues from licensing our middleware to network operators 
our opportunities for future revenue growth with middleware are limited by the actual number of worldwide network operators and by technology decisions they make from time to time 
we have on a historic basis derived a significant percentage of our total revenues from royalties associated with the deployment of our middleware and fees charged for services rendered in support of our middleware deployments 
while we continue to seek deployments within the united states  we have a significant number of customers outside of the united states that have deployed our middleware 
in most cases  the number of network operators in any particular country is relatively small  and to the extent that we have already achieved deployments in those countries  the opportunities for future growth of our middleware business may be limited 
our capacity to generate future revenues associated with our middleware may also be limited due to a number of reasons  including network operators that have selected our middleware may switch to another middleware platform for the provision of interactive services  reduce their pace of set top box deployment or stop deploying set top boxes enabled with our middleware  decrease or stop their use of our support services  or choose not to upgrade or add additional features to the version of our middleware running on their networks  network operators that have not selected our middleware may choose another middleware platform for the provision of interactive services  or a meaningful opportunity to deploy our middleware in the markets that have not yet adopted interactive television on a large scale may never develop or may develop at a very slow pace 
any of these eventualities would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we offer volume discounts to certain customers  which may  over time  depress our average pricing 
while deployments of our software may continue to grow  those discounts  as they are triggered  may limit the rate of our royalty growth in the future 
in certain instances  we provide volume discounts to customers based on the number of copies of our software that they deploy 
as a result  although we may experience continued growth in middleware deployments  the average price for each copy licensed to certain customers may decline over time  which could slow the growth of our royalty payments in the future 
if current deployment trends continue in a manner consistent with those of  we would expect the average pricing for our middleware  over the course of  to decline for certain customers  which could limit the overall growth rate of our royalty revenues 
we expect a more significant portion of our revenue growth in the future to be derived from interactive applications that we develop and market 
if we are not successful in developing and marketing interactive applications  our future revenue growth may be limited 
we expect over the next several years to develop extensive interactive applications  including addressable and targeted advertising and programming synchronous applications 
the market for interactive applications is still nascent and evolving 
historically  we have derived only a relatively small percentage of our total revenue from these offerings 
we cannot be certain that the demand for or the market acceptance of interactive applications will develop as we anticipate  and even if they do  we cannot be certain that we will be able to market that content and those applications effectively and successfully respond to changes in consumer preferences 
in addition  our ability to market those products will be affected to a large degree by network operators 
if network operators determine that our interactive applications do not meet their business or operational expectations  they may choose not to offer our applications to their customers 
to the extent that network operators fail to renew or enter into new or expanded contracts with us for provision of interactive content  such as our enhanced interactive television service  and applications  such as the playjam channel  we ii 
table of contents will be unable to maintain or increase the level of distribution of our interactive applications and the associated revenue from those offerings 
moreover  due to global economic conditions  network operators may slow down their deployment of new content and applications offerings  and such actions would negatively impact our revenue 
accordingly  our ability to generate substantial revenues from our interactive content and applications offerings is uncertain 
two of our potential north american cable customers  cox communications and comcast corporation  joined together in early to acquire certain assets from liberate technologies  one of our direct competitors in the middleware business 
that acquisition  if it closes  is likely to eliminate cox and comcast as potential customers for our middleware  which could adversely affect our ability to grow 
in january  double c technologies  a joint venture formed by cox communications and comcast corporation  announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of liberate s north american business 
our middleware competes directly with the middleware software included within those assets being transferred by liberate 
to date  while we have licensed certain of our technologies to comcast  and expect to pursue additional applications opportunities with both cox and comcast  we have not licensed to either of these companies our middleware solutions 
assuming that this transaction closes  we would not expect cox or comcast  in light of the assets that they are acquiring from liberate  to license middleware or related solutions from us 
if that assumption is correct  our opportunity to license our middleware in the united states to cable operators will be materially diminished and our future revenue growth may  accordingly  be adversely affected 
in addition  it is unclear whether double c technologies will only develop that technology for the benefit of comcast and cox or whether it will attempt to sell that technology and related products to other cable operators in competition with opentv 
a significant percentage of our revenues are currently provided by entities affiliated with the news corporation  which also controls companies that compete with us in certain market segments 
those circumstances may make it more difficult for us  over the long term  to sell products  technologies or services to news corporation affiliates in market segments in which other news corporation affiliates offer competing products 
the news corporation currently controls nds group and gemstar tv guide international  inc  each of which competes with us in certain respects 
the news corporation also controls  directly or indirectly  or exerts significant influence over  a number of our customers  including bskyb  sky italia and foxtel 
for the year ended december   bskyb  sky italia and foxtel  accounted  in the aggregate  for of our revenues 
while we believe that our relationships with each of these customers is good  and we have multi year contracts with each  the long term implications of the news corporation owning technology companies that directly compete with us in certain respects is difficult to assess 
we may be at a disadvantage in selling certain of our products  technologies or services to the news corporation affiliates over the long term when in direct competition with other companies in which the news corporation maintains a significant ownership interest 
we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls were not effective as of december  if we do not properly address identified weaknesses and implement additional controls to remedy those weaknesses  the reliability of our financial statements could be implicated and  ultimately  our financial results and our stock price could suffer 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires companies to do a comprehensive evaluation of their internal control over financial reporting and their disclosure controls 
to comply with this new statute  our management assessed our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls 
we identified certain weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of december  that we have discussed in a separate report included as part of our annual report 
those weaknesses related to a lack of segregation of certain duties within our financial group and certain inadequacies in the controls associated with our financial review and closing process 
based on those findings  we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december  we also concluded that  as a result of those ii 
table of contents material weaknesses  our disclosure controls  as of december   were not effective 
we began to implement additional controls and procedures in the first quarter of with the intention of remedying those weaknesses 
these efforts have required significant managerial effort  and we have incurred substantial costs in undertaking those efforts 
if our efforts to remedy the weaknesses we identified are not successful  the reliability of our financial statements could be impaired  which could adversely affect our stock price and could also affect our company in other adverse ways 
in addition  the ongoing costs associated with implementing such additional controls and procedures  and otherwise complying with the requirements of sarbanes oxley  are not immaterial  and while we would expect those costs to decline over the next several years they do impose greater financial burdens on medium sized companies such as ours than were originally anticipated 
we may be unable in the future to raise additional capital required to support our operating activities 
we expect to be able to fund our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months by using existing cash balances and short term and long term marketable debt securities  if our assumptions about our revenues  expenses and cash commitments are generally accurate 
nevertheless  we have incurred to date and we expect that we will continue to incur in the future significant expenses  many of which result from non cancelable operating commitments 
as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities 
we used approximately million in cash for operating activities during the year ended december  and million during the year ended december  we may need to raise additional capital in the future if our revenue growth does not meet our expectations or we are unable to reduce substantially the amount of cash used in our operating activities 
while we continue to monitor our operating expenses and seek to bring them in line with our revenues  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so 
to the extent we are required to raise additional capital  we may not be able to do so at all or we may be able to do so only on unacceptable terms 
if we cannot raise additional capital on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products and services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  any of which could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations or future prospects 
we realize a percentage of our revenue from revenue sharing and subscription based arrangements  especially in our applications business 
we are not certain that those revenue models will be generally acceptable to our customers over the long term or that they will offer us significant opportunities for revenue growth  which could adversely affect the growth opportunities for our applications business 
we have historically generated a substantial portion of our revenue from royalty and licensing fees related to the licensing of our middleware products and from fees for professional services that we provide 
we believe that our capacity to generate future revenues in this manner may be limited  and if we are unsuccessful in evolving our revenue model  our opportunities for future revenue growth  particularly outside of the united states  may be limited 
while we currently generate a percentage of our revenues from revenue sharing arrangements with network operators  programmers and advertisers  and from subscriber based arrangements  we cannot be certain that those revenue models will be accepted by our customers over the long term  or that our customers will allow us to participate in their revenue streams on those bases 
if our efforts to identify other sources of revenue in addition to the licensing of our middleware are unsuccessful  then our future results of operations will be adversely affected 
the market for our products and services is subject to significant competition  which could adversely affect our business 
we face competition from a number of companies  including many that have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources and better recognized brand names than we do 
current and potential competitors in one or more aspects of our business include interactive technology companies  companies developing interactive television content and entertainment  and  in the professional services area  ii 
table of contents third party system integrators and internal information technology staffs at our network operator customers 
some of our customers or their affiliates offer products or services that compete with our products and services 
for example  as we noted above  double c technologies  a joint venture between cox and comcast  is expected to acquire the north american assets of liberate technologies  which includes its middleware business 
in addition to our playjam and playmontecarlo applications  bskyb also offers its own competitive gaming and gambling applications through its broadcast network 
if any of these competitors achieves significant market penetration or other significant success within the markets upon which we rely as a significant source of revenue  or in new markets that we may enter in the future  our ability to maintain market share and sustain our revenues may be materially and adversely affected 
the trend of consolidation among industry participants may adversely impact our business  results of operations and future prospects 
there has been a worldwide trend of consolidation in the cable and direct broadcast satellite industries 
we believe this trend is likely to continue due to economic and competitive concerns 
this trend appears to be expanding to include other companies involved with the interactive television industry 
for example  in addition to the acquisition of liberate technologies discussed above  comcast and gemstar tv guide international inc  a media and technology company  formed a joint venture last year called guideworks to develop an interactive programming guide for the cable television industry 
while the full impact of this trend is uncertain at the present time  we will need to adapt to changing relationships with industry participants and address competitive concerns that may arise as companies consolidate 
if we are unable to successfully manage these changing relationships and address these competitive concerns  our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 
unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect our stock price 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance 
if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts  the market price of our publicly traded securities could be negatively affected 
our quarterly operating results have varied substantially in the past and they may vary substantially in the future depending upon a number of factors described below  including many that are beyond our control 
our operating results may vary from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors  including changes in the rate of capital spending and the rollout of interactive television related products and services by network operators  the number  size and scope of network operators deploying opentv enabled interactive services and the associated rollout to subscribers  increased competition in general and any changes in our pricing policies that may result from increased competitive pressures  potential downturns in our customers businesses or in the domestic or international markets for our products and services  the ability to generate applications related revenue from existing and potential customers  changes in technology  whether or not developed by us  our ability to develop and introduce on a timely basis new or enhanced versions of our products that can compete favorably in the marketplace  and the timing of revenue recognition associated with major licensing and services agreements 
because a high percentage of our expenses  particularly compensation  is fixed in advance of any particular quarter  any of the factors listed above could cause significant variations in our earnings on a ii 
table of contents quarter to quarter basis 
you should not rely on the results of prior periods as an indication of our future performance 
any decline in revenues or a greater than expected loss for any quarter could cause the market price of our publicly traded securities to decline 
we depend upon key personnel  including our senior executives and technical and engineering staff  to operate our business effectively  and we may be unable to attract or retain such personnel 
our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our senior executive officers and other key management and technical personnel 
if certain of our senior executives were to leave the company  we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage 
in addition  we may also need to increase our technical  consulting and support staff to support new customers and the expanding needs of our existing customers 
we have  in the past  experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
if we are not successful in those efforts  our business may be adversely affected 
we continue to evaluate our business operations and may implement structural and other changes that affect the conduct of our worldwide business operations 
as we continue to align our resources appropriately with our evolving business we may face unintended consequences or suffer adverse effects on our operations or personnel 
we review our operations on an ongoing basis with a view towards improving our business performance 
beginning in  we undertook efforts to consolidate our operations  close and relocate various offices around the world and divest non strategic assets 
we also effected certain organizational changes in late to establish business units based on our middleware and applications businesses 
there is a risk that  as new business strategies and administrative processes are developed and implemented  the changes we adopt will be unduly disruptive or less effective than our old strategies and processes 
this may adversely affect our business  results of operations and future prospects 
interactive television remains an emerging business and it may not attract widespread market acceptance or demand 
our success will depend upon  among other things  the broad acceptance of interactive television by industry participants  including operators of broadcast and pay television networks  network operators and manufacturers of televisions and set top boxes  as well as by television viewers and advertisers 
because the market for interactive television remains an emerging market  the potential size of the market opportunity and the timing of its development are uncertain 
the growth and future success of our business will depend in part upon our ability to penetrate new markets and convince network operators  television viewers and advertisers to adopt and maintain their use of our products and services 
because much of our success and value lie in our ownership and use of our intellectual property  our failure to protect our intellectual property and develop new proprietary technology may negatively affect us 
our ability to effectively conduct our business will be dependent in part upon the maintenance and protection of our intellectual property 
we rely on patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright law  as well as confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements  to establish and protect our rights in and to our technology 
we have typically entered into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants  customers  strategic partners and vendors  in an effort to control access to  and distribution of  our software  related documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and other proprietary information without authorization 
policing unauthorized use of our software and proprietary information will be difficult 
the steps we take may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property and the agreements we enter into may not be enforceable in some instances 
in addition  effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries or  alternatively  such protection may be difficult to ii 
table of contents enforce 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of our intellectual property rights and the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could cause us to incur substantial costs and diversion of resources  which in turn could adversely affect our business 
intellectual property infringement claims may be asserted against us  which could have the effect of disrupting our business 
we may be the subject of claims by third parties alleging that we infringe their intellectual property 
the defense of any such claims could cause us to incur significant costs and could result in the diversion of resources with respect to the defense of any claims brought  which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
as a result of such infringement claims  a court could issue an injunction preventing us from distributing certain products  which could adversely affect our business 
if any claims or actions are asserted against us  we may seek to obtain a license under a third party s intellectual property rights in order to avoid any litigation 
however  a license under such circumstances may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we grant certain indemnification rights to our customers when we license our software technologies 
we may  therefore  become subject to third party infringement claims through those commercial arrangements 
in addition  the damages to which we are subject may be increased by the use of our technologies in our customers products 
many of our and our subsidiaries agreements with customers contain an indemnification obligation  which could be triggered in the event that a customer is named in an infringement suit involving their products or involving the customer s products or services that incorporate or use our products 
if it is determined that our products infringe any of the asserted claims in such a suit  we may be prevented from distributing certain of our products and we may incur significant indemnification liabilities  which may adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  while damages claims in respect of an alleged infringement may  in many cases  be based upon a presumed royalty rate that the patent holder would have otherwise been entitled to  it is possible that our liability may increase as a result of the incorporation of our technology with our customer s products 
in some cases  potential damages against us could be based on the profits derived from a product that infringes through the use of our software even though we receive a relatively moderate economic benefit from the licensing arrangement 
the adoption of industry wide standards for interactive television  such as the opencable initiative in north america  could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services or place downward pressure on our pricing 
ongoing efforts to establish industry wide standards for interactive television software include a commitment by cable network operators in the united states to deploy a uniform platform for interactive television based on a jointly developed specification known as the opencable applications platform and an initiative by european television industry participants to create a similar platform called multimedia home platform 
the establishment of these standards or other similar standards could adversely affect the pricing of our products and services  significantly reduce the value of our intellectual property and the competitive advantage our proprietary technology provides  cause us to incur substantial expenditures to adapt our products or services to respond to these developments  or otherwise hurt our business  particularly if our products require significant redevelopment in order to conform to the newly established standards 
ii 
table of contents our failure to participate in certain industry standards setting organizations  including cablelabs  may adversely affect our ability to sell products or services to network operators or other potential customers that are members of those organizations 
we have not  to date  determined to become a member of cablelabs  the research and development consortium managing the opencable initiative  and certain other standards setting organizations 
while we continually assess our position with respect to any relevant standards setting organizations  and have joined several of them  our failure to participate in certain organizations may affect the willingness of their respective members to conduct business with us 
if that were the case  our ability to continue to grow our business might be adversely affected 
the adoption of incompatible standards by our industry and rapid technological advances could render our products and services obsolete or non competitive 
the migration of television from analog to digital transmission  the convergence of television  the internet  communications and other media  and other emerging trends  such as the deployment of high definition television and multicasting  are creating a dynamic and unpredictable environment in which to operate 
our ability to anticipate trends and adapt to new technologies and evolving standards is critical to our success 
the deployment of new digital television applications  such as high definition television and multicasting multiple television programs through a single channel  may compete directly with our products and services for broadcast distribution capacity 
to the extent that such capacity cannot accommodate all of the applications that a cable or direct broadcast satellite system operator wants to distribute  then there is a risk that other applications will be deployed to the exclusion of our content and applications 
if this occurs  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
any delay or failure on our part to respond quickly  cost effectively and sufficiently to these developments could render our products and services obsolete or non competitive and have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  we must stay abreast of cutting edge technological developments and evolving service offerings to remain competitive and increase the utility of our services  and we must be able to incorporate new technologies into our products in order to address the increasingly complex and varied needs of our customer base 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully  and any failure to do so may adversely affect us 
government regulations may adversely affect our business 
the telecommunications  media  broadcast and cable television industries are subject to extensive regulation by governmental agencies 
these governmental agencies continue to oversee and adopt legislation and regulation over these industries  particularly in the areas of user privacy  consumer protection  the online distribution of content and the characteristics and quality of online products and services  which may affect our business  the development of our products  the decisions by market participants to adopt our products and services or the acceptance of interactive television by the marketplace in general 
in particular  governmental laws or regulations restricting or burdening the exchange of personally identifiable information could delay the implementation of interactive services or create liability for us or any other manufacturer of software that facilitates information exchange 
these governmental agencies may also seek to regulate interactive television directly 
future developments relating to any of these regulatory matters may adversely affect our business 
changes to current accounting policies or in how such policies are interpreted or applied to our business could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way in which we conduct our business and could make it difficult for investors to assess properly our financial condition or operating results 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which are subject to interpretation by the american institute of certified public accountants  the public company accounting oversight board  the securities and exchange commission and various ii 
table of contents other bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in these policies or in how such policies are interpreted or applied to our business could have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions 
our accounting policies that recently have been or may in the future be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows software revenue recognition  accounting for stock based compensation  and accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a software company  our revenue recognition policy  in particular  is a key component of our results of operations and is based on complex rules that require us to make judgments and estimates 
in applying our revenue recognition policy  we must determine what portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred 
as a result  we may receive cash from a customer but not be able to recognize the revenue associated with that cash for some period of time under applicable accounting rules 
this results in our recording the cash as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
because different contracts may require different accounting treatment  it may be difficult for investors to properly assess our financial condition or operating results unless they carefully review all of our financial information  including our statement of operations  our balance sheet and our statement of cash flows 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r which requires the measurement of all employer share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of income 
the accounting provisions of this standard are effective for reporting periods beginning after june  the adoption of those provisions  which have been previously disclosed on a pro forma basis in our financial footnotes  is likely to have a significant effect on our consolidated statement of loss 
through the use of our technology  we have the ability to collect personal and confidential information from set top boxes 
if we fail to protect this information from security breaches or misuse this information  then our operations could be disrupted and we could be subject to litigation and liability under privacy laws 
through the technology that we license for use in set top boxes  we have the ability  when requested by our customers  to collect and store personal information from users of our applications 
subject to applicable laws  and the agreement of our customers and consumers  we may also seek to use such information to help develop addressable and targeted advertising businesses 
storage and use of such information is subject to laws and regulations and may also subject us to privacy claims relating to its use and dissemination 
in addition  a third party might be able to breach our security measures and gain unauthorized access to our servers where such information is stored and misappropriate such information or cause interruptions to our business operations 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to monitor the laws applicable to privacy matters  to protect against security breaches or to deal with the consequences of any breach 
a breach of privacy rights by us  network operators or others could expose us to liability 
any compromise of security or misuse of private information could materially and adversely affect our business  reputation  operating results and financial condition and expose us to costly litigation and regulatory action 
concerns over the security of personal information transmitted through our applications and the potential misuse of such information might also inhibit market acceptance of our applications  and if this occurs  our business and operating results will be adversely affected 
ii 
table of contents if we continue to develop and seek to market gaming and gambling applications  we must assess the legality of these types of activities in different jurisdictions 
our inability to launch these applications legally  the uncertain regulatory landscape for these applications and the significant costs associated with ongoing evaluations regarding the state of gaming and gambling laws around the world may adversely affect our business 
we develop and market gaming and gambling applications for interactive television based on technologies and know how that we acquired through bettingcorp 
in many jurisdictions throughout the world  the laws regulating gaming and gambling  particularly through media such as interactive television and the internet  are highly uncertain and subject to frequent change 
the penalties in many jurisdictions include both civil and criminal penalties 
while we continually assess the laws and regulations regarding gaming and gambling ventures  and engage special outside legal counsel to assist in that process  we cannot be certain that our interpretation of  or the advice that we receive from outside professionals with respect to  those laws will necessarily be the only possible interpretation 
the costs associated with that evaluative process are not  and will not be  insignificant 
in the event that we are incorrect in our interpretation of certain laws or regulations  we may be subject to penalties 
moreover  we may be required to make significant changes to our business  if those laws or regulations change in ways that we do not anticipate or expect 
the uncertainty inherent in these matters  the changing nature of these laws and regulations  and the significant costs associated with our ongoing evaluation of those laws and regulations  may adversely affect our business over time 
if we do not believe that we can legally and effectively launch gaming and gambling applications  our future growth may be impaired 
our multinational operations expose us to special risks that could increase our expenses  adversely affect our operating results and require increased time and attention of management 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from customers located outside of the united states and have significant operations in a number of countries around the world 
our international operations are subject to special risks  including differing legal and regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements  potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy  misappropriation or weaker laws regarding intellectual property protection  export and import restrictions  tariffs and other trade barriers  currency fluctuations and devaluations  difficulties in staffing and managing offices as a result of  among other things  distance  language and cultural differences  longer payment cycles and problems in collecting accounts receivable  political and economic instability  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
our software products may contain errors  which could cause us to lose revenue and incur unexpected expenses 
software development is an inherently complex and subjective process  which frequently results in products that contain errors  as well as defective features and functions 
moreover  our technology is integrated into the products and services of our network operator customers 
accordingly  a defect  error or performance problem with our technology could cause the systems of our network operator customers to fail for a period of time or to be impaired in certain respects 
any such failure could subject us to damage claims and claims for indemnification by our customers and result in severe customer relations problems and harm to our reputation 
ii 
table of contents while our agreements with customers typically contain provisions designed to limit or exclude our exposure to potential liability claims in those circumstances  those provisions may not be effective  in all respects  under the laws of some jurisdictions 
as a result  we could be required to pay substantial amounts of damages in settlement or upon the determination of any of these types of claims 
the interests of our majority owner may differ from yours and may result in opentv acting in a manner inconsistent with your general interests 
liberty media corporation beneficially owns our class a and class b ordinary shares representing approximately of the economic interest and of the voting power of our ordinary shares outstanding as of december  as a result of its ownership of our ordinary shares  liberty media has sufficient voting power  without the vote of any other stockholder  to determine the outcome of any action presented to a vote of our stockholders  including amendments of our memorandum of association and articles of association for any purpose which could include increasing or reducing our authorized capital or authorizing the issuance of additional shares 
the interests of liberty media may diverge from your interests  and liberty media may be in a position  subject to general fiduciary obligations  to cause or require us to act in a way that is inconsistent with the general interests of the holders of our class a ordinary shares 
because we are controlled by liberty media  we are exempt from certain listing requirements of the nasdaq national market relating to corporate governance matters 
over the past several years  the national association of securities dealers has adopted certain listing requirements for the nasdaq national market system designed to enhance corporate governance standards of the companies who are listed thereon 
as a result of liberty media s beneficial ownership of our class a and class b ordinary shares  we are not subject to some of these requirements  including the requirement that a majority of our board of directors be independent under the guidelines established by the national association of securities dealers and certain requirements regarding the determination of our chief executive officer s compensation and our director nominees 
while we do not believe that our exemption from those requirements affects the manner and method by which we manage and operate the company  investors should be aware that we are not subject to those provisions and may have no obligation to comply with those requirements in the future unless our ownership profile changes 
because we are a british virgin islands company  you may not be able to enforce judgments against us that are obtained in united states courts 
we are incorporated under the laws of the british virgin islands 
as a result  it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process upon us within the united states or to enforce against us judgments obtained in the united states courts  including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states 
we have been advised by our british virgin islands counsel  harney westwood riegels  that judgments of united states courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states may be difficult to enforce in british virgin islands courts and that there is doubt as to whether british virgin islands courts will enter judgments in original actions brought in british virgin islands courts predicated solely upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states 
because we are a british virgin islands company  your rights as a stockholder may be less clearly established as compared to the rights of stockholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions 
our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum of association and articles of association and by the international business companies act of the british virgin islands 
principles of law relating to such matters as the validity of corporate procedures  the fiduciary duties of management and the rights of our stockholders may differ from those that would apply if we were incorporated in the united states or another jurisdiction 
the rights of stockholders under british virgin islands law are not as clearly established as are the rights of stockholders in many other jurisdictions 
thus  our stockholders may have more difficulty protecting ii 
table of contents their interests in the face of actions by our board of directors or our controlling stockholder than they would have as stockholders of a corporation incorporated in another jurisdiction 
certain provisions contained in our charter documents could deter a change of control of us 
certain provisions of our memorandum of association and articles of association may discourage attempts by other companies to acquire or merge with us  which could reduce the market value of our class a ordinary shares 
the comparatively low voting rights of our class a ordinary shares as compared to our class b ordinary shares  approximately of which are beneficially owned by liberty media as of december   as well as other provisions of our memorandum of association and articles of association  may delay  deter or prevent other persons from attempting to acquire control of us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks 
this exposure relates to our holdings of fixed income investment securities  investments in privately held companies and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
fixed income investment risk we own a fixed income investment portfolio with various holdings  types and maturities 
these investments are generally classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses  net of tax  included as a separate component of the balance sheet line item titled accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
most of these investments consist of a diversified portfolio of highly liquid united states dollar denominated debt securities classified by maturity as cash equivalents  short term investments or long term investments 
these debt securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
our investment policy limits the maximum maturity of securities in this portfolio to three years and weighted average maturity to months 
although we expect that market value fluctuations of our investments in short term debt obligations will not be significant  a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the value of securities with longer maturities in the portfolio 
alternatively  a sharp decline in interest rates could have a material positive effect on the value of securities with longer maturities in the portfolio 
we do not currently hedge interest rate exposures 
our investment policy limits investment concentration in any one issuer other than with respect to united states treasury and agency securities and also restricts this part of our portfolio to investment grade obligations based on the assessments of rating agencies 
there have been instances in the past where the assessments of rating agencies have failed to anticipate significant defaults by issuers 
it is possible that we could lose most or all of the value in an individual debt obligation as a result of a default 
a loss through a default may have a material impact on our earnings even though our policy limits investments in the obligations of a single issuer to no more than five percent of the value of our portfolio 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair values in our portfolio of investment securities with original maturities greater than days as of december  using a model that assumes immediate sustained parallel changes in interest rates across the range of maturities in thousands valuation of valuation of valuation of securities if securities if securities if interest rates fair value as of interest rates interest rates issuer decrease december  increase increase us government and agencies corporate notes and bonds auction rate securities certificate of deposit ii 
table of contents the modeling technique used in the above table estimates fair values based on changes in interest rates assuming static maturities 
the fair value of individual securities in our investment portfolio is likely to be affected by other factors including changes in ratings  market perception of the financial strength of the issuers of such securities and the relative attractiveness of other investments 
accordingly  the fair value of our individual securities could also vary significantly in the future from the amounts indicated above 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in various foreign countries 
we incur a substantial majority of our expenses  and earn most of our revenues  in united states dollars 
a majority of our worldwide customers are invoiced and make payments in united states dollars 
a minority of our worldwide customers are invoiced by our non united states business units under contracts that require payments to be remitted in local currency 
we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management policy 
the policy permits the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts and the use of other hedging procedures in connection with hedging foreign currency exposures 
the policy requires that the use of derivatives and other procedures qualify for hedge treatment under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we regularly assess foreign currency exchange rate risk that results from our global operations 
we did not use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or options in hedging foreign currency exposures during there were no foreign exchange forward contracts or other procedures implemented to hedge foreign currency exposures outstanding as of december  we expect over time  however  that a more significant number of our european customers will seek to pay us in euros  which may affect our risk profile and require us to make use of appropriate hedging strategies 
while we anticipate a certain portion of our revenues in will be paid to us in euros  we do not believe that such payments will require a material change in our existing hedging policies
