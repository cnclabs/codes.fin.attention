overview the company was formed in february for the purpose of organizing the bank 
the company opened the bank for business in february with million in assets and has grown to approximately million as of december  in  the company experienced significant growth as our assets increase million during the year 
this growth was partially due to the expansion of the institutional business banking line in conjunction with a strategic decision by management and the board of directors to grow the asset size of the bank to help manage the increasing cost of being a highly regulated industry and public company 
management anticipates that  as a result of a modestly growing economy in the michiana area and the increased asset size of the company  the growth in assets may continue at a slower annual percentage rate than experienced hist orically 
however  management does expect that the company s assets will continue to grow by taking additional market share  expanding into new markets  expanding existing business lines  and as the local economy grows 
the bank continues to focus on the goals established at its inception 
the bank offers a distinct approach to serving its clients using an operating philosophy that emphasizes integrity in dealing with others  an extraordinary execution of service  and innovation  with technology driven delivery of products 
this approach  along with the management s strong ties to the indiana and michigan communities it serves  has been the foundation of its success in building client relationships and maintaining controlled  profitable growth 
this focus allows the bank to operate in an effective and efficient manner providing exceptional client service yet permitting the bank to be competitive in the marketplace 
the operating philosophy is reflected in the results of the company s operations and should be considered as they are analyzed 
a consistently l ow overhead ratio continues to allow for competitive product pricing and lower service charges for the bank s clients 
the focus on credit quality is evident as the bank has not yet experienced a single loan charge off  which in turn allows for more efficient use of the company s resources  including time  dollars  and energy 
these established goals have made the company unique in the marketplace and unique to its clients 
the return on average assets roaa and return on average equity roae have steadily increased from the inception of the company through in  the roaa and roae were negatively impacted by severance expense and professional fees related to the departure of two of the company s officers 
in  roaa and roae were at and returning to higher levels than experienced prior to management expects that  over time  the company s roaa and roae will continue to improve as the company s fixed costs and capital base are further leveraged 
a consistent philosophy since inception has been the focus on superior asset quality 
as a general rule  the most credit worthy borrowers are able to negotiate very favorable pricing terms in the market 
additionally  for strategic reasons  the bank has retained substantially all of its residential mortgage loans 
again  it is generally accepted that residential mortgage loans are less risky than other types of loans 
therefore  the interest rates on residential mortgages are less than other types of term loans 
these two factors have contributed to the superior asset quality record achieved by the bank but have also resulted in a more modest net interest margin 
partially off setting the lower net interest margin is the company s low overhead ratio non interest expense divided by average assets 
another important aspect of the operating philosophy of the company is to continue to grow at an appropriate rate resulting in fixed non interest expense to become a smaller percentage of total assets  which should lead to continued improvement in the roaa and roae 
the total asset growth rate during was enhanced by the strategic decision to increase the asset size of the bank 
non interest expense as a percentage of total assets was   and for years ending   and at the annual meeting of shareholders held on may   the company announced plans to expand into elkhart  indiana with a new banking center that will open in april of this was previously discussed in the description of business section of this document 
several new employees will be added due to the new banking center but ten of the employees needed for an additional full service location will come from the bank s existing employee base 
this fact combined with a reasonable overhead cost for the new location is the reason non interest expenses for the company is not expected to be significantly impacted 
in august  the company announced that the bank was expanding its institutional banking business line 
this expansion was the direct result of management s intent to attract and serve a larger percentage of the municipal and institutional market 
management s efforts to expand this business line during the third and fourth quarter of resulted in the bank obtaining several new municipal and institutional deposit relationships that significantly helped fund the asset growth of the company 
the funding provided by these new relationships began in september of but primarily impacted the company in the fourth quarter of and will continue to have an impact in the first quarter of the institutional banking business line is not new to the bank 
since its inception  institutional funding has been a crucial part of the bank s strategic plan 
over the years  the company has strived to separate itself by providing exceptional service and developing a product line that would be specifically suited for institutional and municipal clients 
due to the current size and success of the company  the reputation the company has earned by providing exemplary service  and the need for additional growth to help offset the increasing overhead costs of a highly regulated industry and public company requirements  management and the board of directors determined that this was the opportune time for this expansion 
management expects to continue to aggressively grow the institutional banking business line and as opportunities arise and are developed  additional growth in this business line should be expected 
in conjunction with the decision to expand the bank s institutional banking business line  the bank activated limited trust powers and created the st 
joseph capital bank trust department 
these limited trust powers allow the bank to execute corporate agency trusts and will be offered only to the bank s institutional banking clients 
by entering into corporate agency trust relationships with certain institutional banking clients  the bank is able to provide another option for managing their funds invested with the bank 
by sweeping a portion of deposited funds into corporate agency trust accounts  the bank can manage these client funds off balance sheet in the trust department  which does not require an allocation of the bank s capital 
no other type of corporate or personal trust relationship is expected to be offered by the st 
joseph capit al bank trust department 
at december   there were no trust account balances and no additional assets under management in the trust department 
in october  the company purchased million of bank owned life insurance on certain officers of the bank  for which the bank is the sole beneficiary 
the underlying financial instruments used by the insurance carriers to support the life insurance product provide a return that increases the cash surrender value of the insurance carried on the company s balance sheet 
besides providing life insurance on certain officers of the bank  the increase in cash surrender value is recorded as non interest income and is designed to help offset portions of existing employee benefits 
the current federal tax code allows this non interest income to be used to fund employee benefits and to be treated as tax free income as long as the final distribution of the financial instruments is paid as life insurance proceeds 
the bank owned life insurance is transferab le to other carriers and can be redeemed for the cash surrender value at any time 
however  if redeemed prior to its final distribution  the increase in the cash surrender value becomes taxable and is subject to certain penalties 
in december of  the company began transferring a portion of its investment portfolio to a newly created investment subsidiary  st 
joseph capital holdings  inc  located in wilmington  delaware 
the investment subsidiary is designed to help manage the company s investment portfolio by providing portfolio management services  safekeeping services  and allow state tax treatment of the investment income using the delaware state tax laws  which does not tax investment income 
the transfer of the company s entire investment portfolio was completed in january the creation of this investment subsidiary currently provides the company assistance in managing its investment portfolio along with a reduction in the company s state tax liability attributed to the interest income from the investment portfolio 
the following discussion provides additional information regarding the company s financial condition at december  and and operations for the years ended december    and the objective of this financial review is to enhance the reader s understanding and should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this form k 
for a description of the company s accounting policies  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies certain of the company s accounting policies are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition  since they require management to make difficult  complex  or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances 
some of the facts and circumstances  which could affect these judgments  include changes in interest rates  the performance of the economy or the financial condition of borrowers 
management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses 
allowance for loan losses 
the company maintains an allowance to absorb probable loan losses inherent in the portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management considers to be adequate based on ongoing monthly assessments and evaluations of the collectibility of the bank s loans 
provisions for loan losses are based on the management s review of credit loss experience among its peers and such factors that  in management s judgment  deserve consideration under existing economic conditions in estimating probable loan losses 
management s strategy for credit risk management oversight includes a combination of conservative exposure limits significantly below legal lending limits  conservative underwriting standards  and comprehensive loan documentation and review 
the strategy also em phasizes diversification at the industry and client levels  regular credit examinations and periodic management reviews of large credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality 
the allowance for loan losses balance and the provision for loan losses are determined by management based upon periodic reviews of the loan portfolio 
through the loan review and credit department  management allocates specific portions of the allowance for loan losses based on specifically identifiable problem loans 
in addition  as the bank does not have an established charge off history  management considered the level of charge offs on loans experienced by local peer financial institutions having loan portfolio mix and risk characteristics similar to the bank s loan portfolio mix and risk characteristics 
estimating the risk of loss and the amount of loss is necessarily subjective 
accordingly  the allowance is maintained by management at a level considered adequate to cover losses that are currently anticipated based on the combination of the los s experience of the bank and local peers  general economic conditions  information about specific borrower situations including their financial position  and collateral values and other factors and estimates which are subject to change over time 
the reserve analysis is reviewed regularly by management and the board of directors 
general allocations for loan types may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  reflect the impact of any current conditions on loss recognition 
factors that management considers in the analysis include the effects of the national and local economies  trends in the nature and volume of loans  changes in mix  asset quality trends  loan grades  risk management and loan administration  changes in the internal lending policies and credit standards  and examination results from bank regulatory agencies and the bank s internal independent loan reviews 
an unallocated reserve is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring loss when evaluating reserves for individual loans or pools of loans 
reserves on individual loans and general allocation rates are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and or collateral conditions 
while management s periodic analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses may allocate portions of the allowance for specific problem loan situations  the entire allowance is available for any loan charge offs that occur 
the company has not substantively changed its overall approach in the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
as the company has matured and economic conditions have changed  the company has made only minor changes in assumptions or estimation techniques as compared to prior periods that impacted the determination of the december  allowance for loan and lease losses 
the bank has not experienced any charge offs from loans receivable since inception and at december   no portion of the allowance for loan losses was allocated to impaired loan balances  as there were no loans considered impaired 
based on the policy discussed above  management is of the opinion that the allowance of million was adequate to absorb estimated loan losses associated with the loan portfolio at december  however  there can be no assurance that future losses will not exceed the estimated amounts or that the company will not be required to make additional provision for losses in the future 
financial condition december  compared with december  during  the company s assets increased from million on december   to million on december  this was a increase compared to a increase during the previous year 
as in the past  a consistent emphasis on deposit growth provided the funding needed to increase the net loan portfolio by million  increase the securities portfolio by million and purchase million of bank owned life insurance during these areas of growth were the primary contributors to the million overall increase in assets 
at december   cash and cash equivalents increased million  from million in to million in for the second year in a row there was a delay in the receipt of property tax dollars from taxpayers used to fund indiana municipalities 
the bank s institutional funding from their municipal clients was reduced to below normal balances in the last half of the year 
in the fourth quarter  property tax dollars were collected and the proceeds were used to replenish our municipal clients deposit balances 
as will be discussed in greater detail in the results of operations section of this document  a portion of these funds deposited increased the bank s cash and cash equivalents 
specifically  on the last day of the year  approximately million in deposits were made by municipalities that significantly increased the y ear end balance of cash and cash equivalents on december  the average balances during and for cash and cash equivalents were million and million 
these average balances represent more normal levels of cash and cash equivalents 
subsequent to the end of  a significant portion of the cash and cash equivalents was invested into securities available for sale and loans 
the million increase in securities available for sale  from million at december  to million at december   was a significant change in the company s assets during the year 
the growth experienced in securities available for sale was primarily in us government and federal agency securities  from million at december  to million at december   and obligations of states and political subdivision securities  from million at december  to million at december  also  mortgage backed securities increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase in securities available for sale was a result of the need to deploy funds from the growth in deposits during and part of the company s strategic plan to increase the volume of inte rest earning assets 
the company s loan portfolio increased million or  from million at december  to million at december  this growth was primarily in the company s commercial loan portfolio  which increased million or of the annual increase 
the residential mortgage portfolio had an increase of million during the loan growth during the year is attributed to adding new loan relationships  the expansion of borrowing relationships from existing clients and from the purchase of loan participations 
the continued significant concentration of the loan portfolio in commercial loans and the continued future growth of this portion of the bank s lending business are consistent with the company s stated strategy of focusing on small to mid size businesses 
commercial loans make up of net loans at december  and approximately of the commercial loans are secured by real estate 
management anticipates this growth will continue as additional relationships are developed as a result of current calling efforts  the addition of new lending personnel  and the expansion into a new market area 
the deposit accounts related to the bank s commercial lending business generate a significant amount of local deposits  and are an important funding source for the bank 
the quality of the loan portfolio remains strong 
the company has not experienced any charge offs since inception 
management believes they have instilled a very strong credit culture within the lending department as it pertains to the underwriting and administration processes and no change is expected as the loan portfolio grows 
over of the loan portfolio consists of loans extended directly to companies and individuals doing business and residing within the company s market area or having strong  long standing ties to management 
the remaining portion is comprised of commercial loans participated with certain non affiliated commercial banks outside of the immediate area  which are underwritten using the same loan underwriting criteria as though the bank was the originating bank 
the economy in the company s market area began a steady but modest increase in and has continued improving during during this period  the company has grown and has maintained roughly the same interest rate spread on the loan portfolio  while at the same time experienced no significant change in asset quality or in non performing loan totals 
however  due to the slowdown in economic growth prior to and the modest rate of the growth in the current economy  borrowers may experience difficulty  and the level of non performing loans  charge offs  and delinquencies could rise and require further increases in the provision for loan losses 
premise and equipment increased from million at december  to million at december  this increase  primarily in the fourth quarter of  was due to the accounting guidance on consolidating variable interest entities 
as part of the company s expansion into elkhart  indiana  the company became a owner in a limited liability corporation  riverfront partners  llc llc  to help ensure that the company had a level of control over its new location 
the other owners  a local development group  own of the new location and are responsible for building and managing the property 
due to the nature of the llc the accounting guidance classified it as a variable interest entity requiring it to be consolidated into the company s financial statements 
the company s new elkhart banking center will occ upy the first floor of a three story facility and the impact to the company s net income will be the profit or loss in the llc and the allocated expense for the portion of the building the company occupies 
management believes that the net cost of the new location will not significantly impact the company s results in the million increase in premise and equipment in was due to the recording of the construction in progress on the new location 
the total cost of the building is expected to be approximately million and will be consolidated on the company s financial statements 
as discussed in the overview section  the company purchased million of bank owned life insurance in october of this financial instrument will continue to increase in value as the cash surrender value increases and will continue to be recorded as non interest income 
this purchase was funded by the growth in deposits during the million growth in deposits in was mainly in interest bearing deposits 
this was a increase in compared to a increase in interest bearing deposits made up approximately of the bank s deposits at december  as discussed above in cash and cash equivalents  on december   deposits of approximately million were made on december   and therefore classified as non interest bearing 
on the next business day  when the funds were collected they became interest bearing 
the average balance of deposits was million during and million during deposit balances at year end were million at december  and million at december  the million increase in the average balance of deposits from to  compared to the million increase in year over year deposits at december  demonstrates that the growth in deposits came later in the year primarily due to the company s new and existing deposit relationships with municipalities 
the bank expects to continue to see additional growth in deposits during and to retain a significant portion of the deposits that existed at december  to date  the bank has been successful in attracting and retaining client relationships  which have provided a significant portion of the funding needed to grow the loan portfolio and increase the investment portfolio 
management has accepted million in brokered certificates of deposit as of december  compared to million at december  management utilizes this funding source to assist in the overall asset liability management of the bank 
for the most part  these certificates of deposit are term in nature and are used to assist the bank in funding term loans and as a means to manage the company s overall interest rate risk 
management believes the ability to attract and retain deposits is attributed to more personalized service than the competition 
the deposit growth in  along with the million increase in equity achieved primarily through the retention of earnings  provided the funding needed to meet the million growth in assets 
federal funds purchased increased to million at december  compared to no federal funds purchased at december  federal funds purchased are used as a temporary funding source by the bank to meet short term liquidity needs 
the bank has over million in federal funds lines established at correspondent banks 
at times  there will be differences between asset growth and the funding that supports this growth 
the use of federal funds purchased provides short term funding for these differences when funding is needed 
federal home loan bank of indianapolis fhlb advances decreased million  or  to million as of december  compared to million at december  management uses fhlb advances primarily to assist in the overall asset and liability management of the bank and for general liquidity purposes 
as of december   the company held million of fhlb stock 
securities sold under agreement to repurchase increased by million at december  compared to the prior year 
as part of the company s sweep accounts  collected funds from business clients noninterest bearing checking accounts are invested into overnight interest bearing repurchase agreements 
although not considered a deposit account and therefore not fdic insured  the repurchase agreements from local corporate clients have historically been a very stable source of funding for the bank 
results of operations compared with overview 
consolidated net income for the year ended december   was million compared to million in for an increase of  or 
net income for the year ended december  was negatively impacted by approximately  net of tax  from severance expenses during the third quarter of related to the departure of two officers from the company 
income per common share for the year ended december  increased to basic and fully diluted  compared to basic and fully diluted in the exercise of stock options  which increased the average number of shares outstanding by approximately  shares as compared to  reduced the increase in net income to a increase in basic income per common share 
the increase in net income for the year ended december  compared to t he same period in the prior year was comprised of an increase in net interest income of million and a decrease in provision for loan losses of  offset by an increase in non interest expense of  and an increase in income tax expense of  net interest income 
the largest component of net income is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loans and securities available for sale  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in the net interest income are the result of changes in volume  net interest spread  and net interest margin 
volume refers to the average dollar levels of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income during the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  over the million earned in yields on the company s interest earning assets declined by basis points to during the year ended december   from in this decrease was the result of the change in the mix of assets due to the significant growth in deposits during the first quarter of along with a lower rate environment at the beginning of as compared to the beginning of rates paid on interest bearing liabilities remained at for both and due to a decline in the yield on the company s interest earning assets with no change in the rate paid on the company s interest bearing liabilities  coupled with the growth in interest earning assets  the net interest margin declined basis poin ts from at december  to at december  a higher growth rate in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can generate more net interest income during a period despite a decreasing margin  as long as the volume variance is greater than the negative rate variance 
also  as demonstrated during the first quarter of  a significant change in the mix of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities can impact the net interest margin 
for the year ended december   the increase in net interest income of million over the same period in was primarily the result of increased volume 
management believes that the current level of interest rates are significantly driven by external factors and that the net interest margin could continue to compress if interest rates overall continue to increase at a slow pace and the company continues to grow 
as the company grows  the additional leveraging of capital increases the percentage of interest bearing liabilities used to fund the asset growth and will tend to push the net interest margin lower 
if interest rates continue to increase at a measured pace  net interest income can be increased by growth in interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets 
management expects a continued modest rise in interest rates in the short term 
therefore  continuing the effort to optimize the asset mix which seeks to neutralize the net interest margin impact associated with a changing rate environment and adding volume to the balance sheet should enable the company to increase net interest income and the return on equity in the future 
the repositioning of assets moving out of cash and cash equivalents and into securities available for sale and loans and the use of new deposit funding has resulted in the net interest margin returning to a more normal level 
in the latter half of  st 
joseph and elkhart counties our primary market area had a delay in the receipt of property tax dollars that affected the funding needs for various local municipalities to operate 
the bank s municipal client deposit balances were reduced to below normal during this period and the municipal clients looked to public sources to borrow the funds needed to operate 
at the end of december  the property tax dollars were collected and began to replenish the municipal deposit accounts  which provided substantial amounts of cash and cash equivalents to the company 
since the bank s municipal clients borrowed funds during the period  a portion of the funds deposited at the end of and january was used to pay back the borrowings and was only deposited for a short time 
as the municipal deposit balances returned to more normal levels  the company was able to make the shift from cash and cash equivalents to securities available for sale and loans that are higher yielding assets 
during  property tax bills were again delayed 
both the may and september tax bills were mailed in october  which resulted in the receipt of all property tax dollars for being collected in november and paid to the municipalities in december and january in anticipation of the influx of deposits in the fourth quarter  management developed a plan to make the necessary balance sheet allocations to help minimize the impact to the net interest margin in the first quarter of the events described above impacted the company s net interest margin negatively during the first quarter of due to the lower spread on the short term assets while the company held the funds and from the temporarily inflated cash and cash equivalent balances that increased the average interest earning asset balance for the period 
the excess cash and cash equivalent balances were invested in available for sale securities and loans along with the use of additional deposit funding during the second  third  and fourth quarters 
the company s net interest margin returned to more normal levels but began to drop slightly in the fourth quarter due to more cash in the asset mix again 
the net interest margins for each of the three month periods ending march   june   september   and december  were    and 
as discussed above  the lower margin for the year ended december   was significantly impacted by the increase in cash and cash equivalents from the municipal funds deposited at the beginning and end of the year ended december  demonstrated that the margin did rebound from the lower level during the first three months of  due partially to the asset mix variance 
management believes that the timing of the funding received from their municipal client will be more evenly balanced in as the governing bodies have indicated that property tax collection should take place both in july and december of provision for loan losses 
provisions to the allowance for loan losses during the year ending december  totaled  a decrease from  expensed in the provision expensed for the year ended was slightly lower than the provision expensed in even with the loan volume being greater in the decrease in provision expense was the result of management s loan loss reserve analysis reserve analysis determining that the amount of allowance for loan loss required for the loan portfolio should decrease as a percentage of gross loans 
the reserve analysis along with other relevant allowance for loan loss details is included in the critical account policy located in this documents 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans outstanding as of december  was compared to at dec ember  if the company s continued loss experience is similar to the past and the local economy remains stable  it is expected that the reserve analysis will continue to require a smaller allowance for loan loss as a percentage of total loans outstanding 
depending on the results of the reserve analysis and the pace of loan growth in the future  the provision to the allowance for loan loss required may continue to decline 
the bank has not experienced any charge offs from loans receivable since inception 
at december   no portion of the allowance for loan losses was allocated to impaired loan balances  as there were no loans considered impaired 
management believes the allowance for loan losses at december  was adequate to absorb losses in the loan portfolio  including probable incurred losses due to the current state of the economy 
however  there can be no assurance that future losses will not exceed the estimated amounts or that the bank will not be required to make additional provision for losses in the future 
non interest income 
non interest income remained primarily the same at  for the year ending compared to  in service charges on deposit accounts increased only slightly during the period as more clients maintained higher average balances in their demand deposit accounts to pay for service charges 
due to the company s operating philosophy  which includes a general aversion to excessive service charges on deposit accounts  significant changes in service charges would not be expected except as a result of continued growth in deposit relationships 
gain on sale of securities in was  compared to  in the company s primarily sells securities for liquidity purposes that may result in security gains or losses 
except for liquidity needs  the company s intent is to hold their investment securities to maturity 
the purchase of bank owned life insurance added  of non interest income in management anticipates that non interest income will increase in primarily from the increased cash surrender value for the entire year of the bank owned life insurance recorded as non interest income 
non interest expense 
the main components of non interest expense were salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment  professional fees  and data processing 
non interest expense for the year ended december  was million as compared to million in  an increase of  or 
while overhead continues to increase in order to support its larger client base and overall size  management continues to be focused on controlling these expenses without impairing the quality of service provided to clients or the ability to grow the company 
salaries and employee benefits  which were the largest component of non interest expense  experienced the most significant dollar changes of any non interest expense component 
for the year ended december   total salaries and employee benefits were million compared to million in the increase in employee salaries and benefits for the year was the result of merit increases and the hiring of nine new employees since december  some additional hiring is expected during to continue to meet the needs of the company as it grows 
occupancy and equipment  professional fees  data processing and other expense did not have any significant changes during the year ended december  as compared to monitoring and controlling non interest costs  while at the same time providing high quality service to clients  is one of management s top priorities 
management does anticipate that in these costs will increase as the result of growth and the expansion into elkhart  indiana  however  these costs will be carefully monitored and are not expected to have a significant impact on net income 
income taxes 
income tax expense was million during compared to million in the effective tax rates were and for the year ended december  and the decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was the result an increase in the tax exempt interest income from additional purchases of municipal securities  tax exempt non interest income from the bank owned life insurance  and the transfer of a portion of the investment securities portfolio to the bank s delaware investment subsidiary reducing the state tax liability from the interest income received at the subsidiary 
management anticipates that the impact of these various tax planning strategies put into place during will have a continued impact in lowing the effective tax rate during compared with overview 
consolidated net income for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for  for an increase of  or over income per common share for increased to basic and diluted from a basic and 
diluted income per common share for the increase in net income in compared to the prior year was comprised of an increase in net interest income after provision for loan losses of million offset by a decrease in non interest income of  and also reduced by an increase in non interest expense of million 
income tax expense was million in both and net interest income 
net interest income during was million  an increase of over the million earned during yields on the bank s interest earning assets declined by basis points to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  rates paid on interest bearing liabilities dropped by basis points during this same period 
the similar basis point decrease on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities allowed the bank s net interest spread to decline by only one basis point from in to in management s ability to manage the yields on assets and the rates paid on liabilities during contributed to the net interest margin decreasing by only five basis points from for to for the sligh tly larger decrease in the net interest margin of five basis points compared to the one basis point decrease in the net interest spread was due to the volume and mix of assets and liabilities 
the increased volume in interest earning assets can generate more net interest income during a period despite the decreasing yields  as long as the volume variance is greater than the negative rate variance 
however  the additional leveraging of capital  which increases the percentage of interest bearing liabilities used to fund the asset growth  will push the net interest margin lower 
in  the increase in net interest income of million was the result of increased volume 
provision for loan losses 
provisions to the allowance for loan losses during totaled  a decrease from the  expensed during the lower provision expense for was partly attributable to a slow down in the rate of growth of the loan portfolio from million in to million in one measure of the adequacy of the allowance for estimated losses on loans is the ratio of the allowance to the total loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans outstanding as of december  was  compared to at december  the decrease in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans receivable was primarily a result of management s risk assessment of the portfolio 
non interest income 
non interest income decreased by  in compared to non interest income in consisted mainly of depository account service fees  interchange income on credit cards  and net gain on sales of securities available for sale 
non interest income in consisted primarily of depository account service fees  interchange income on credit cards  and net gain on sales and calls of securities available for sale 
the decline in overall non interest income was primarily due to the decrease in net gain on sale of securities from  in to  in service charges on deposit accounts increased only slightly as more clients maintained higher average balances in their demand deposit accounts to pay for service charges 
non interest expense 
the main components of non interest expense were salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment  professional fees  and data processing for and non interest expense for was million as compared to million in salaries and employee benefits  which are the largest component of non interest expense  experienced the most significant dollar increase of any non interest expense component 
for  total salaries and employee benefits were million compared to million for the increase in employee salaries and benefits was a result of merit increases and hiring additional sales staff in order to continue to grow the business as well as providing high quality client service 
in addition  salaries and employee benefits included severance expense and expense related to the accelerated vesting of stock options of  from the departure of two officers from the company 
of this amount  approximately  was a non cash charge to the income statement for the accelerated vesting of stock options for the severed employees 
also during and consistent with its previous an nouncement of it s adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  the company began expensing the fair value of stock option awards earned during the year 
the amount for this new expense was  in there was no direct income statement impact for this activity in prior periods 
please refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more details 
occupancy and equipment expense and data processing expense remained primarily unchanged during as compared to professional fees increased from  in to  in mostly due to costs related to the departure of the two officers who resigned from the company in income taxes 
the effective tax rate in was compared to in as earnings increase  the company will continue to record the calculated tax expense at similar rates 
liquidity the bank s liquidity is measured by the ability to raise funds through deposits  borrowed funds  capital or cash flow from the repayment or maturities of loans and securities and net profits 
these monies can be used to fund loan requests  meet deposit withdrawals  maintain reserve requirements  and support operations 
liquidity is primarily achieved through the growth of deposits both local and out of area and by maintaining liquid assets such as securities available for sale  matured securities  and federal funds sold 
asset and liability management is the process of managing the balance sheet to achieve a mix of earning assets and liabilities in such a way that manages interest rate risk and assists in achieving an acceptable level of profitability 
an important part of the overall asset and liability management process is providing adequate liquidity 
liquid assets w ere million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  the bank s liquidity strategy is to fund loan growth with deposits  repurchase agreements  and fhlb advances and to maintain an adequate level of short and medium term investments to meet typical daily loan and deposit activity 
although deposit and repurchase agreement growth from depositors located in the market area have consistently increased  the growth has not been sufficient at times to meet the substantial loan growth and provide monies for additional investing activities 
to assist in providing the additional needed funds  the bank has obtained certificates of deposit from customers outside of the market area and placed by deposit brokers for a fee  as well as certificates of deposit obtained from the deposit owners directly 
as of december   brokered deposits totaled million  or of combined deposits and repurchase agreements  compared to million  o r of combined deposits and repurchase agreements  as of december  the acceptance of brokered deposits is expected to be an ongoing activity due to planned future growth and managing a consistent level of deposits 
the bank has the ability to borrow money on a daily basis through correspondent banks via established federal funds purchased lines  however  this is viewed as only a secondary and temporary source of funds 
the average balance of federal funds sold during equaled million  compared to million average balance of federal funds purchased 
as a member of the fhlb  the bank has access to the fhlb s borrowing programs 
based on available collateral at february   the bank could borrow up to approximately million subject to the purchase of additional stock in the fhlb 
as of december   million in fhlb advances was outstanding 
the availability could continue to increase if the loan and investment portfolios grow in the future 
in addition to typical loan funding and deposit flows  the bank must maintain liquidity to meet the demands of certain unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit 
as of december   there were a total of million in unfunded loan commitments and million in unfunded standby letters of credit 
fluctuations in loan balances and commitment levels are monitored  with such data being used in managing overall liquidity 
the statements of cash flows for the periods presented provide an indication of the company s sources and uses of cash as well as an indication of its ability to maintain an adequate level of liquidity 
a discussion of the statements of cash flows for   and follows 
during all periods presented  the company experienced a net increase in cash from operating activities 
net cash from operating activities was million during compared to million during and million during the increase in cash from operating activities was primarily a result of the company s ability to generate net income of million in  million in and million in for   and  the company experienced a net decrease in net cash from investing activities 
net cash from investing activities was million  million and million for   and the changes in net cash from investing activities include purchases  sales  maturities  and calls of securities available for sale  growth in loans receivable and purchases of premises and equipment 
net cash flow from financing activities was million  million  and million for   and in  the increase was primarily attributable to the growth in deposits of million  an increase of million in securities sold under the agreement to repurchase  and an increase in federal funds purchased of million offset by a decrease in net fhlb advances of million 
in  the increase was primarily attributable to the growth in deposits of million  net fhlb advances of million  and subordinated debentures of million offset by a decrease of million for securities sold under the agreement to repurchase 
in  the increase was primarily attributable to the growth in total deposits of million and net fhlb advances of million 
contractual obligations payments due by period dollars in thousands less than to to after total year years years years certificate of deposit fhlb advances subordinated debentures total contractual cash obligations the long term debt obligations consist of certificates of deposit  advances from the fhlb  and subordinated debentures 
the above schedule represents principal payments only and does not include interest 
capital resources retained earnings at december  was million compared to million at december  the increase in retained earnings was due to the company s net income of million for offset slightly by cash dividends paid of  accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax from net unrealized loss on securities available for sale  was  as of december  as compared to  net unrealized gain on securities available for sale as of december  the decline since december  was primarily attributable to the overall interest rate environment during the year 
total shareholders equity was million as of december   an increase of million from million as of december  the increase resulted from the increase in the net income for the year as well as the proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options decreased by the cash dividends paid by the company 
the company is subject to regulatory capital requirements primarily administered by federal banking regulatory agencies 
failure to meet the various capital requirements can cause regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the financial statements 
since the bank commenced operations  both the company and the bank have been categorized as well capitalized  the highest classification contained within the banking regulations 
the components of total risk based capital are tier capital and tier capital 
tier capital is total shareholders equity less intangible assets 
tier capital is tier capital plus a portion of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is includable in tier capital up to a maximum of of risk weighted assets 
the net unrealized appreciation depreciation on securities available for sale  net of tax  is not considered in meeting regulatory capital requirements 
the tables in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements provide the minimum regulatory capital requirements and the actual capital ratios at december  and as of december   management was not aware of any current recommendations by the banking regulatory authorities which  if they were to be implemented  would have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  capital resources or operations 
on march   the company issued an additional million of trust preferred securities to help ensure that the company and the bank are well capitalized 
the company and bank are committed to maintaining a well capitalized position  therefore  due to the asset growth of the company during and anticipated future growth  these trust preferred securities will be needed to help meet the capital needs 
management of interest sensitivity the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  liquidity risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure of the company s financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates 
the company derives its income primarily from the excess of interest collected on its interest earning assets over the interest paid on its interest bearing liabilities 
the rates of interest the company earns on its assets and owes on its liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
since market interest rates change over time  the company is exposed to lower profitability if it cannot adapt to interest rate changes 
accepting interest rate risk can be an important source of profitability and shareholder value  however  excessive levels of interest rate risk could pose a significant threat to the comp any s earnings and capital base 
accordingly  effective risk management that maintains interest rate risk at prudent levels is essential to the company s safety and soundness 
evaluating the exposure to changes in interest rates includes assessing both the adequacy of the process used to control interest rate risk and the quantitative level of exposure 
the bank s interest rate risk management process seeks to ensure that appropriate policies  procedures  management  information systems and internal controls are in place to maintain interest rate risk at prudent levels with consistency and continuity 
in evaluating the quantitative level of interest rate risk  management assesses the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on the company s financial condition  including capital adequacy  earnings  liquidity  and asset quality 
management uses three interest rate risk measurement techniques 
the first  which is commonly referred to as gap analysis  measures the difference between the dollar amounts of interest sensitive assets and liabilities that will be refinanced or re priced during a given time period 
a significant re pricing gap could result in a negative impact to the bank s net interest margin during periods of changing market interest rates 
the second interest rate risk measurement used is commonly referred to as net interest income simulation analysis 
management believes that this methodology provides a more accurate measurement of interest rate risk than the gap analysis  and therefore  serves as one of its primary interest rate risk measurement techniques 
the simulation model assesses the direction and magnitude of variations in net interest income resulting from potential changes in market interest rates 
key assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on various loan and investment assets  cash flows and maturities of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  and changes in market conditions impacting loan and deposit volume and pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to fluctuation and revision in a dynamic environment  therefore  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or exactly predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and the bank s strategies  among other factors 
management conducted multiple simulations as of december   whereby it was assumed that a simultaneous  instant and sustained change in market interest rates occurred 
results of the simulation suggest that the bank could expect net interest income to increase by approximately  if interest rates gradually decline by basis points over the next twelve months  and to decrease approximately  if interest rates gradually increase basis points over the next twelve months  from forecast levels of net interest income absent any changes in rates 
these variances in net interest income were within the bank s policy parameters established to manage interest rate risk 
other simulations are run quarterly looking at changes to net interest income given and basis point changes in interest rates 
the third interest rate risk measurement used is commonly referred to as an eve analysis or an economic value of equity analysis 
along with the simulation analysis  management believes that the eve analysis methodology provides a more accurate measurement of interest rate risk than the gap analysis  and therefore  serves as one of management s primary interest rate risk measurement techniques 
the eve analysis assesses the impact to the value of equity given potential changes in market interest rates 
key assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on various loans  discount rates and the duration of assets and liabilities as determined by the federal regulatory agencies 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  subject to fluctuation and revision in a dynamic environment  therefore  the model cannot precisely estimate the value of equity or exactly predict the impact that higher or lower interest rates will have on the value of equity 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and the company s strategies  among other factors 
results of the economic value of equity analysis done as of december   suggest that the bank could expect the value of its equity to increase and  if there was an immediate interest rate shift upward of and basis points and to decrease and  if there was an immediate interest rate shift downward of and basis points 
management believes the different scenarios indicate a financial services organization that has relatively low overall interest rate risk 
austin advisors  inc  a firm specializing in consulting and providing assistance to banks  performs a formal asset liability management analysis on a monthly basis 
this information is presented and reviewed by the asset liability committee 
impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and therefore the company differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation significantly affects non interest expense  which tends to rise during periods of general inflation
