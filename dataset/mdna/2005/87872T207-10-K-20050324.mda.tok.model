item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during we acquired two businesses in separate transactions  zamba corporation zamba and proceed north america llc proceed 
on december  we completed the acquisition of zamba  which gives us a stronger position in the customer relationship management market 
under the terms of the transaction zamba stockholders received shares of our common stock for each share of zamba common stock effective december  accordingly statements regarding our future performance and our balance sheet as of december  are for tsc and zamba combined  however  the operating results for do not include the results for zamba 
on october   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with proceed under which we acquired proceed s business 
proceed is the primary implementation partner for sap packaged services in the us 
the operating results of proceed are included in our results from the date of acquisition 
the results of our operations are affected by general economic conditions as well as the level of economic activity and changes in the industries that we serve 
while the general economy and the information technology it consulting services market maybe improving  there is no assurance that improving conditions will result in an increase in our future revenues given the fundamental changes in the it service industry as set forth below 
in addition  increases in demand for our services generally tend to lag behind economic cycles 
accordingly  any benefit to our business of any economic recovery may take longer to realize 
in the second half of  we began to refocus and rebuild our business by investing in a range of specialty services in order to differentiate ourselves from our competition 
in mid  we continued this rebuilding process and transformation of our business model by increasing focus on and strengthening both our vertical industry and competency groups 
as part of this transformation  we hired new client officers during the second half of to provide additional expertise in these industries and functional capabilities 
in addition  we made two acquisitions  as discussed above 
we continue to look at appropriate acquisition opportunities that meet our business model 
as a result of these changes  as well as the addition of several client officers  our revenues in the fourth quarter of increased percent compared to the third quarter of we expect quarterly revenues in the first quarter of to improve as compared to the fourth quarter of  partially as a result of our acquisition of zamba 
we incurred operating losses during and and we expect to incur an operating loss during as we continue our efforts to transform and rebuild our business 
we believe the information technology services industry is undergoing fundamental changes  resulting in increased competitive pressure 
these changes include competition from application software firms as they continue to enhance services and implementation capabilities to increase their revenue  offshore application development and system consulting and support firms which typically have much lower labor costs and billing rates  and the proliferation of enterprise resource planning erp expertise within the it departments of organizations  reducing the need to engage outside consulting services 
the availability of offshore technical expertise has page 
table of contents and will continue to have an impact on the it consulting market 
however  we believe the demand for high end value added technically and functionally competent innovative consultants will increase over time 
the complexity of corporate it functions is not diminishing 
in addition  we believe that the upcoming baby boomer retirement will impact the supply of trained consultants in the market 
our business is also driven by the pace of technological change  our ability to differentiate ourselves from our competitors through specialty services that address targeted industry and business concerns  and the type and level of spending by our clients in the areas in which we provide services 
many factors can result in a deferral  reduction or cancellation of services requested by our prospective or current clients including budget constraints  economic conditions and perceived project progress  success or value 
the economic uncertainties of recent years have led many corporations to reassess their it goals and budgets 
this  combined with the lack of significant new technology to stimulate spending  had a further dampening impact on demand for our services 
however  we believe that many companies have very old systems and technology and real time business decision making capabilities will fuel growth in many of our markets 
during periods of decreased demand  pricing pressures emerge as companies try to minimize costs and negotiate lower prices for our services 
our ability to successfully identify and prepare for these changes is a key driver of our performance 
therefore  our strategy is to try to anticipate these trends and identify cost management initiatives that will allow us to manage costs relative to expected revenues as well as identifying opportunities to increase revenues 
although we remain committed to spending our funds wisely  there is a point at which further cost cutting can be counter productive 
project personnel costs constitute the majority of our operating costs 
since project personnel costs are primarily driven by the cost of billable personnel  mainly compensation and benefits  maintaining these costs at a reasonable and predictable percentage of revenue is critical to our financial performance 
project personnel costs as a percentage of revenues are driven by utilization and average hourly billing rates 
utilization represents the percentage of time our billable professionals spend on billable work 
it is our strategy to try to match our project personnel supply with demand 
at times this requires us to reduce headcount and reassign employees to other active projects when they are no longer needed on a particular project 
however  because of the mix of skills needed and project duration  implementation of this strategy may be delayed at times 
accordingly  any decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in staffing  or a staffing increase that is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in revenues  would have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition  which could be material 
revenues for presentation purposes  we show two components of revenues revenues before reimbursements  which consist of revenue for performing consulting services  and reimbursements  consisting of reimbursements we receive from clients for out of pocket expenses incurred 
we believe revenues before reimbursements is a more meaningful representation of our economic activity since it excludes pass through  zero margin expense reimbursements 
page 
table of contents costs and expenses project personnel project personnel costs consist primarily of professional salaries and benefits 
other project expenses other project expenses consist of the cost for subcontractors hired for use on our client projects and billed to our clients  employee termination costs  and nonreimbursable expenses incurred for client projects and business development 
nonreimbursable expenses include recruiting fees  certain selling expenses and personnel training 
reimbursable expenses reimbursable expenses represent project related and other out of pocket expenses that are reimbursable by the client 
an equivalent amount is included in revenues under the caption reimbursements 
bad debt expense we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments 
we also analyze our notes receivable  which are included in long term receivables and other on our consolidated balance sheet 
management and administrative support management and administrative support costs consist of client officer costs and infrastructure costs 
client officer costs include client officer salaries and travel  marketing costs and recruiting costs 
client officers are a critical component in our client relationship selling model 
each of our clients has at least one client officer assigned to them 
the client officers are responsible for delivery excellence  client relationship and satisfaction  revenues  utilization  project margins  days sales outstanding and human capital  including recruiting and career development 
in addition  each client officer is also a billable consulting resource 
infrastructure costs include costs related to our senior corporate management and board of directors  accounting  financial reporting  finance  tax  legal  treasury  human resources  employee benefits  marketing  public and investor relations  office operations  staffing of our project personnel  recruiting  training  internal communications  internal technology applications  management of new business opportunities  planning  quality assurance  and risk management 
incentive compensation incentive compensation  if any  is accrued at a set percentage of base salary  which varies by level of employee  and is adjusted to reflect the amounts needed for active employees and for performance against targets  goals and objectives 
payments of incentive compensation  if any  are performance based and are determined by both objective financial based and subjective measures 
these objectives include both quarterly and full fiscal year parameters 
page 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions  which it believes are reasonable 
if actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates  the revisions are included in the company s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and when different estimates than management reasonably could have used have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
revenue recognition we derive our revenues from a variety of business and information technology consulting services  including systems integration  packaged software integration and implementation services  programming  training and extended support services 
our services are contracted on either a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis 
for our time and materials contracts  we recognize revenue as work is performed  primarily based on hourly billing rates 
for our fixed price contracts  we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method  which is based on the percentage of work performed in the period compared to the total estimated work to be performed over the entire contract 
revenues are subject to revision as the contract progresses to completion 
any revisions in the estimate are charged to operations in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
contracts are performed in phases 
losses on contracts  if any  are reserved in full when determined 
contract losses are determined by the amount by which the estimated cost of the contract exceeds the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract 
extended support revenues are recognized as services are rendered 
allowance for doubtful receivables an allowance for doubtful receivables is maintained for potential credit losses 
when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful receivables  management specifically analyzes accounts receivable on a client by client basis  including customer credit worthiness and current economic trends  and records any necessary bad debt expense based on the best estimate of the facts known to date 
should the facts regarding the collectability of receivables change  the resulting change in the allowance would be charged or credited to income in the period such determination is made 
such a change could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
accounting for income taxes we use an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided using currently enacted tax rates when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of page 
table of contents assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have generated certain deferred tax assets as a result of operating losses and temporary differences between book and tax accounting  as well as tax benefits resulting from the exercise of employee stock options that were recorded as additional paid in capital in the period of exercise 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets 
during  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
if the realization of our deferred tax assets in future periods is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to our deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination is made 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is based on significant estimates 
changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations in future periods 
valuation of stock options and warrants we account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
compensation costs for employee stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the company s common stock at the date of grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
in connection with our acquisition of zamba  we used the black scholes option pricing model for the valuation of the options and warrants issued in connection with this acquisition 
the black scholes option pricing model requires assumptions in regards to the expected lives of the options and warrants  expected volatility of our stock price and risk free interest rates 
as we have not and do not anticipate paying dividends  the dividend yield is assumed to be zero 
goodwill and intangible assets we account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangibles that are deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but  instead  are to be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
intangible assets continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be evaluated for impairment annually or if an event occurs or if circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the acquisition below its book value 
the impairment test is conducted based on the revenues derived from the acquired entity utilizing a fair value methodology 
we evaluate the fair value of our acquisitions utilizing various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis 
this implied fair value is compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill for the individual acquisition 
if the fair value is less  we would then recognize an impairment loss 
in addition  we evaluate the intangible assets with definite lives to determine whether adjustment to these amounts or estimated useful lives are required based on current events and circumstances

depending on revenues and cash collections  we expect our cash and cash equivalent balance at march  to be approximately million to million 
while we will continue to incur operating losses in the first half of  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements 
our investment policy is to maintain most of our cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid  large money market type funds 
this policy exposes us to short term interest rate fluctuations 
operating results and liquidity  including our ability to raise additional capital if necessary  may be materially and adversely affected by continued low demand for the company s services 
in addition  a number of other factors  including general economic conditions  technological changes  competition and other factors affecting the it industry generally  and the suspension or cancellation of a large project could have an adverse effect on future results and liquidity 
these aforementioned factors  as well as other factors  are discussed further in this section under assumptions underlying certain forward looking statements and factors that may affect future results 
we had a nonqualified deferred compensation plan 
all company executives defined as those at the level of vice president and above were eligible to participate in this voluntary program  which permitted participants to defer receipt of a portion of their compensation 
we held deferred amounts in a rabbi trust for the benefit of plan participants and investment earnings or losses were credited to the participants accounts based on investment allocation options selected by the participants 
we did not guarantee these investments or earnings thereon 
these investments remained assets of the company and were available to the general creditors of the company in the event of our insolvency 
the plan was terminated and all funds were distributed to the participants in february impact of inflation and backlog inflation should not have a significant impact on our operating results to the extent we are able to raise our hourly billing rates commensurate with our staff compensation rates 
however  if we are unable to raise our hourly billing rates  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
because the majority of our contracts may be terminated on relatively short notice  we do not consider backlog to be meaningful

table of contents rapid technological change the systems consulting and implementation market is characterized by rapid technological advances and developments  including the development and issuance of new software products and applications 
the introduction of new services can make existing services unmarketable 
in order to grow and remain competitive  we need to adapt to these rapidly changing technologies  to enhance our existing solutions and to introduce new solutions to address our clients changing demands 
our failure to stay abreast of such advances and developments could materially adversely affect our business 
we utilize a number of different technologies in developing and providing it solutions for our customers 
the technologies we use are developing rapidly and are characterized by evolving industry standards in a wide variety of areas 
while we evaluate technologies on an ongoing basis and endeavor to utilize those that are most effective in developing it solutions for our customers  there can be no assurance that the technologies we utilize and the expertise we gain in those technologies will continue to be applicable in the future 
there can be no assurance that new technologies will be made available to us or that we will be able to economically apply them 
the inability to apply existing technologies and expertise to subsequent projects could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
need for increased revenues in recent periods  we have experienced decreased demand for our services resulting in declining revenues and recurring operating losses 
for the year ended december  we had an operating loss of million and for the year ended december  we had an operating loss of million 
our ability to attract business from new clients through sales and marketing efforts and through specialty services that address targeted industry and business concerns  and our ability to successfully manage fluctuations in demand  will be key to our success in the future 
among the strategic initiatives that we have taken to address the need for increased revenues has been the introduction of new service offerings 
the acquisition of zamba is part of that strategy  as are the introductions of our healthcare and consumer and retail service offerings 
no assurance can be given that these or any future service offerings will gain acceptance with our existing clients or any prospective clients 
the absence of successful new service offerings or substantial expansion of existing service lines will have an adverse impact on our future revenues 
in addition  in recent years no major technological developments have been introduced that could replace the applications with respect to which we currently provide services or render some of our existing expertise obsolete 
if such developments occur there can be no assurance that we will have the technological expertise to provide services covering such developments 
our revenues in the fourth quarter of increased percent compared to the third quarter of we expect quarterly revenues in the first quarter of to improve as compared to the fourth quarter of  partially as a result of our acquisition of zamba 
however  we expect to incur an operating loss during as we continue our efforts to refocus and rebuild our business 
if we are unable to continue to increase revenues  manage growth and projects effectively and regain profitability  we may realize a material adverse effect in the quality of our page 
table of contents services and products  our ability to retain key personnel and our business  financial condition and results of operations 
restructuring initiatives in response to industry and market conditions  we have restructured our business and reduced our workforce 
in light of ongoing changes in the market for many of our information technology services  we may have to restructure in the future to achieve additional cost savings or to strategically realign our resources 
we cannot predict whether we will realize synergies and improved operating performance as a result of any such restructuring 
we also cannot predict whether any restructuring will adversely affect our ability to retain key employees which  in turn  could adversely affect our operating results 
availability of cash resources we expect to experience continued operating losses until revenues increase sufficiently to cover operating costs 
until such time  our operating losses and the associated cash requirements are expected to be funded from existing cash resources 
if we are not successful in increasing revenues and eliminating negative cash flows  it could become necessary to raise additional capital to offset losses from operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any financing or that  if we were to be successful in finding financing  it would be on favorable terms 
in addition  the decreasing level of cash available to us could have an adverse impact on the market value of our common stock as well as our ability to continue as a going concern 
utilization and charge rates our current profit margins are largely a function of the respective rates we are able to recover for our services and the utilization rate  or chargeability  of our professionals 
accordingly  if we are not able to maintain or improve current pricing for services or an appropriate utilization rate for our professionals  our profit margin and profitability will suffer in the absence of corresponding cost reductions 
the rates we are able to recover for our services are affected by a number of factors  including the demand for our services compared to the supply of consultants available to deliver the services  our clients perceptions of our ability to add value through our services  the sensitivity of our clients to changes in prices for our services  our reputation for delivering quality work in a timely manner  the introduction of new in demand services or products by us or our competitors  our competitors pricing policies  and the use of globally sourced  lower cost service delivery capabilities by our competitors and our clients 
we face continuous pressure from several directions on the rates charged to clients 
many of our competitors  including larger consulting firms with greater financial and personnel resources  smaller consulting firms with lower cost structures and large consulting firms in offshore locations such as india that have access to pools of technical consultants at lower costs than consultants based in the united states may be willing to provide the services at a lower incremental cost than us 
page 
table of contents utilization rates are affected by a number of factors  including our ability to transition employees from completed projects to new engagements  our ability to enter into long term contractual relationships with clients  our ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain an appropriate headcount  our ability to increase the ratio of billable employees to non billable employees  and our ability to manage attrition 
we must balance our supply of consultants skilled in a particular service with the demand for that service 
if the combined utilization rate of these consultants is very high it may be difficult to add new clients for these services 
conversely  if the combined utilization rate is too low the profitability of our business will be adversely impacted 
any negative changes to our retention of consultants  utilization rates or billable rates could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
management of change in demand our business has experienced significant volatility in the demand for our services and thus our revenues 
in fact  our quarterly revenues before reimbursements declined each quarter from june  through june  our revenues have increased slightly during the last two quarters of our ability to attract business from new clients through sales and marketing efforts  our specialty services that address targeted industry and business concerns  and our ability to successfully manage fluctuations in demand are key to our future success 
we continue to evaluate our business needs and the skill sets of our employees in order to balance our resources and costs 
any failure to effectively manage our costs and resources will adversely effect our business 
while we have taken steps to reduce our costs  we may be required to take further actions to reduce our costs if our revenues are insufficient to support our cost structure 
however  there is a point at which further cost cutting may be counter productive and we realize we cannot cost cut our way to profitability 
accordingly  any unexpected decline in demand without a corresponding and timely reduction in staffing and other expenses  or a staffing increase that is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in demand  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
additionally  any future increase in demand without a corresponding increase in staffing may render us unable to maintain or improve our market share and or strain or overwhelm existing management resources  operational resources  financial resources and management information systems 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage future fluctuation in demand successfully 
our expense levels are based  in part  on expectations of future revenues 
in addition  a significant percentage of our operating expenses  particularly rent and depreciation  are fixed 
accordingly  an unanticipated decrease in the number or average size of  or an unanticipated delay in the scheduling for  projects  or other decrease in revenues  could materially and adversely affect our operating results and otherwise adversely affect our operations 
an unanticipated termination or decrease in the size or scope of a major project  a client s decision not to proceed with a project as anticipated or the completion during a quarter of a major client project could diminish employee utilization and have a material adverse effect on our page 
table of contents business  financial condition and results of operations 
revenues and earnings may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter because of such factors as the contractual terms and timing of completion of projects  including achievement of certain business results  any delays incurred in connection with projects  the adequacy of provisions for losses and bad debts  the accuracy of our estimates of resources required to complete ongoing projects the loss of key highly skilled personnel necessary to complete projects  increases in expenditures related to growing the business  eg  acquisitions of people and technology  and general economic conditions 
ability to attract and retain employees our business consists mainly of professional services and is inherently labor intensive 
our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees  particularly project managers and other senior personnel 
qualified project managers are often in high demand and are likely to remain a limited resource in the future 
several attributes of our work environment pose challenges to our ability to attract and retain employees  including i extensive travel requirements  ii our intense work environment and culture  iii our standards for employee technical skills and job performance  iv our practice of adjusting the number of technical personnel to reflect active project levels and v the decline in demand for the company s services 
in addition  the number of stock options available for grant to new and existing employees has decreased in recent periods due to grants made to date 
the reduced number of available options could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain the necessary professional personnel 
the approval of our stockholders will be required to increase the number of available options 
no assurance can be given that such approval would be granted if requested or that the number of options could otherwise be increased 
although we expect to continue to attract sufficient numbers of highly skilled employees and to retain many of our existing project managers and other senior personnel for the foreseeable future  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition and inhibit our ability to regain revenues 
dependence on key personnel the loss of some or all of our management personnel or project managers could have a material adverse impact on our business  including our ability to secure and complete engagements 
we have employment agreements with our senior management employees that contain non competition  non disclosure and non solicitation covenants 
our employment agreements generally do not have fixed expiration dates and may be terminated by either party 
most senior employees have employment agreements that are generally terminable by either party upon to days written notice 
page 
table of contents entry into new lines of business we may enter  on our own or through acquisitions  into new lines of business or initiate new service offerings 
our success in any such endeavor will depend upon  among other things  the ability of our management to identify suitable opportunities  successfully implement sound business strategies and avoid the legal and business risks of any new line of business or service offering and or an acquisition related thereto 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to do any of the foregoing 
in addition  any such undertakings may result in additional costs without an immediate increase in revenues may divert management s attention from the operation and growth of our core business 
we may also decide to dispose or otherwise exit businesses  which may result in the recording of accrued liabilities for special one time charges  such as workforce reduction costs and closure of excess facilities 
growth by acquisition from time to time  we may consider acquiring other businesses 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates 
even if we identify suitable candidates  we cannot be sure that we will be able to make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
the success of any such acquisition including our acquisition of zamba will depend upon  among other things  the ability of our management and employees to integrate acquired personnel  operations  products and technologies into our organization effectively  to retain and motivate key personnel of acquired businesses and to retain customers of acquired firms 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities  consummate acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired personnel and operations 
in addition  any acquisitions we undertake may involve certain other risks  including consumption of available cash resources  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns 
litigation from time to time  we have been subject to litigation 
where we can make a reasonable estimate of the probable liability relating to pending litigation  we record a related liability 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability and revise estimates as appropriate 
however  because of uncertainties relating to litigation  the amount of our estimates could be under or over stated 
in addition to the potential cost and use of cash  pending or future litigation could divert management s attention and resources causing a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
because of the increase in litigation risk associated with the technology markets  both directors and officers and errors and omissions insurance rates have increased significantly in the past several years 
we may be subject to further rate increases for both types of insurance 
following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company and its officers and directors 
any such litigation against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
page 
table of contents quarterly results may fluctuate our results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past  due to a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  but are not limited to changing conditions in the information technology market and in the us and global economies in general  the number and timing of new clients and new projects for existing clients  our ability to replace completed projects with new projects in a timely fashion  differences in the number of billing days and or holidays between quarters  the number of vacation days and sick days taken by our employees in a particular quarter  the utilization of our employees  and our ability to match available employee resources with client service requirements  introductions or announcements of new service offerings  changes in accounting rules  such as expensing employee stock option grants  our ability to integrate and operate the zamba business  increased competition from low priced overseas technology consultants  and the costs related to meeting new regulations 
the failure to meet the expectations of the investment community may cause our stock price to decline  possibly substantially 
a significant stock price decline could result in litigation  which could be costly  lengthy and divert management s attention and resources from business operations 
client concentration risks we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of clients 
during the quarter ended december   our top two clients and top five clients accounted for percent and percent of our revenues before reimbursements  respectively 
for  our top two clients accounted for percent of our revenues before reimbursements and our top five clients accounted for percent of our revenues before reimbursements 
in  our top two clients accounted for percent of our revenues before reimbursements and our top five clients accounted for percent of our revenues before reimbursements 
although our large clients may vary from time to time  our revenues and our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely impacted if we were to lose one or more of these clients or if we were unable to collect a large receivable due from one of these clients 
most of our engagements are terminable on to days notice without penalty to the client 
an unanticipated termination of a major project could result in the loss of substantial anticipated revenues and could require us to maintain or terminate a significant number of underutilized employees  resulting in a higher number of unassigned people and or higher severance expenses 
performance of services many of our projects involve technology applications or systems that are critical to the operations of a client s business and handle very large volumes of transactions 
failure to deliver applications or systems to clients with the promised functionality or within the promised time frame  or to satisfy the required service levels for support and maintenance  could result in substantial claims from clients 
while we take precautionary actions to create redundancy and back up systems  any such failures could result in claims by clients for substantial damages 
although we attempt to limit the amount and type of our contractual liability for defects in the page 
table of contents applications  systems or services provided  and carry errors and omission insurance coverage  we cannot assure that these limitations and insurance coverage will be applicable and enforceable in all cases 
even if these limitations and insurance coverage are found to be applicable and enforceable  our liability to our clients for these types of claims could be material in amount and could affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
project risks because of the project based nature of our work and the fact that many of the projects we undertake are large  there is a risk of a material adverse impact on operating results if there is an unanticipated suspension or cancellation of a large project or a client refuses or fails to pay fees and expenses when due 
a project cancellation or suspension or a refusal or failure to pay can be based on any number of causes  many of which are beyond our control 
these include financial difficulties of a client  a change in client priorities  client management or client strategies  and a change in client ownership 
the suspension or cancellation of a project or a failure or refusal to pay fees and expenses when due could result in a decrease or adjustment in revenues  the need to reassign staff and damage to our reputation 
because many of our projects are high profile  mission critical projects for major clients  a failure or inability to meet a client s expectations for the amounts budgeted  timing and deliverables for the projects we undertake could damage our reputation and affect our ability to attract new business 
additionally  certain clients require payment incentives related to factors such as costs incurred  benefits produced  goals attained and adherence to schedule 
in these contracts  payment of all or a portion of the fees owing to us will be contingent upon meeting revenue enhancement  cost saving or other contractually defined goals which are often complex and may often be dependent in some measure on the client s actual levels of business activity 
the insistence by our clients to include in contracts incentives related to additional revenues generated  costs incurred  benefits produced or adherence to schedule or other benchmarks could increase the variability of revenues and margins earned by us on such contracts 
dependence on third party products third party products and services are integral to the success of many of our projects 
to the extent that third parties do not deliver effective products and services on a timely basis  our project results could be negatively impacted 
although we attempt to limit this risk in our engagement arrangements with clients and maintain errors and omissions insurance  the failure of a project could expose us to significant incremental financial exposure 
competition the systems consulting and implementation market includes a large number of participants  is subject to rapid changes and is highly competitive 
we compete with and face potential competition from a number of companies that have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than do we 
we also compete with globally sourced  lower cost service providers as well as smaller service providers with specific  more narrowly focused service offerings 
our clients primarily consist of fortune and other large corporations and there are an increasing number of professional services firms seeking systems consulting and implementation engagements from that client base 
we believe that our ability to page 
table of contents compete depends in part on a number of factors outside our control  including the ability of our competitors to hire  retain and motivate project managers and staff  the long term relationships that our major competitors may have with potential clients  the ownership by our competitors of software used by potential clients  the development by others of software that is competitive with our products and services  and the price at which others offer comparable services 
in addition  our clients could develop or acquire in house expertise in services similar to those we provide  which would significantly reduce demand for our services 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain our existing client base  maintain or increase the level of revenue generated by our existing clients or be able to attract new clients 
susceptibility to economic and industry conditions our revenues and results of operations are subject to fluctuations based on the economic conditions in which we operate 
during periods of economic uncertainty or downturn  businesses typically reduce or eliminate their spending on discretionary items such as the services that we provide 
under such conditions  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
certain of our customers and potential customers are in industries that experience cyclical variations in profitability  which may in turn affect their willingness or ability to fund systems projects such as those for which we may be engaged 
during the downturn of such cycles many of these customers may reduce or eliminate their spending on our services 
pricing pressures and cost overruns we contract services on either a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis 
both forms of contracts require us to estimate the number of hours and the materials required before entering into the contract 
in the case of a time and materials contract  failure to achieve the estimated results could subject us to pricing pressures from clients even though there is no legal obligation to complete the work within the estimates or could lead to the loss of future work from the client 
failure to complete fixed price contracts within the contractual parameters will expose us to unrecoverable cost overruns 
in either case  these failures could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
intellectual property rights our future success depends in part upon our proprietary technology 
although we have attempted to protect our proprietary technology through various mechanisms  including copyrights  trademarks  contractual obligations and trade secrets  third parties nevertheless may attempt to use our technology without authorization 
many of our clients have required that we grant to them all proprietary and intellectual property rights with respect to the work product resulting from our performance of services  including the intellectual property rights to any custom software that we have developed for them 
each such grant of proprietary and intellectual property rights limits our ability to reuse work product components and work product solutions with other clients 
in some situations  we have obtained page 
table of contents either an ownership interest or a license from our clients to permit us to market and sell the custom software we have developed for them 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to obtain these rights in the future 
we also develop certain foundation and application software tools  methodologies and products that we own and license to our clients 
we regard these software tools  methodologies and products as proprietary and intend to protect our rights  where appropriate  with registered copyrights  patents  registered trademarks  trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure and transferring title 
however  there can be no assurance that any of these steps will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary rights or independent third party development of functionally equivalent products 
tsc and technology solutions company are registered service marks of the company 
in addition  our success is dependent upon our specialized expertise and methodologies 
to protect our proprietary information  we rely on a combination of trade secret and common law employee non disclosure policies and third party confidentiality agreements 
however  there can be no assurance that any of these steps will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our specialized expertise and methodologies 
although we believe that our services and products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  there can be no assurance that others will not assert infringement claims against us in the future 
any such claim asserted against us may harm our reputation  cause us to incur costs  prevent us from offering some services or solutions  and divert our management s attention from the operation and growth of our business 
rights plan and corporate governance provisions our stockholder rights plan may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition 
in addition  provisions of our charter and by laws may have a similar effect 
for example  the board of directors has the authority  without further action by the stockholders  to fix the rights and preferences and issue shares of preferred stock 
nasdaq national market listing requirements our common stock is listed on the nasdaq national market  which requires that listed stocks maintain a minimum per share closing bid price of the closing bid price of our stock has dropped below from time to time in the past 
if we fail to satisfy nasdaq s minimum per share closing bid requirements  we could face the possibility of delisting under nasdaq rules 
however  there are a variety of actions that we could take to help prevent a delisting 
risks of conducting international operations we have engaged in limited international operations 
because the cost of doing business abroad is typically higher for united states businesses than the cost of doing business domestically  we could experience a decline in our operating margins if the significance of our international operations increases 
international operations and the provision of services in foreign markets are subject to a number of special risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade barriers  exchange controls  national and regional labor strikes  political risks  additional security concerns and risks of increases in duties  taxes and governmental royalties  as well as changes in laws and page 
table of contents policies governing operations of foreign based companies 
in addition  any success we experience internationally may depend upon our ability to attract  develop and retain a sufficient number of highly skilled  motivated local professional employees in each of those foreign countries where we conduct operations 
competition for such local personnel qualified to deliver our services can be intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to recruit  develop and retain a sufficient number of highly skilled  motivated local professional employees to compete successfully in the international market 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tsc is exposed to interest rate fluctuations 
changes in interest rates affect interest income on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held in trust 
our cash and cash equivalents were primarily invested in overnight money market type accounts 
average interest rates for these investments were approximately percent in compared to approximately percent in based on the cash and cash equivalents balances as of december  and  a hypothetical percent increase in interest rates would have resulted in approximately and million in additional net investment income during each of and  respectively 
as previously noted  marketable securities held in trust were distributed to the participants in the company s nonqualified deferred compensation in late february as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  the financial statements of our non us subsidiaries are remeasured into non us dollars using the local currency as the functional currency 
the market risk associated with the foreign currency exchange rates is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we do not have any significant accounts payable  accounts receivable or commitments in a currency other than that of the reporting unit s functional currency 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage the exposure in non us operations
