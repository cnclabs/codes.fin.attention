item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those we discuss under cautionary factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this report on form k 
general overview we are a leading provider of post secondary education for students seeking careers as professional automotive  diesel  collision repair  motorcycle and marine technicians 
we offer undergraduate degree  diploma or certificate programs at ten campuses across the united states 
we also offer manufacturer specific advanced training programs that are sponsored by the manufacturer or dealer  at dedicated training centers 
we have provided technical education for over years 
our revenues consist principally of student tuition and fees derived from the programs we provide and are presented as net revenues after reductions related to guarantees and scholarships we sponsor and refunds for students who withdraw from our programs prior to specified dates 
we recognize tuition revenue and fees ratably over the terms of the various programs we offer 
we supplement our core revenues with additional revenues from sales of textbooks and program supplies  student housing provided by us and other revenues  all of which are recognized as sales occur or services are performed 
in aggregate  these additional revenues represented less than of our total net revenues in each fiscal year in the three year period ended september  tuition revenue and fees generally vary based on the average number of students enrolled and average tuition charged per program 

table of contents average student enrollments vary depending on  among other factors  the number of i continuing students at the beginning of a fiscal period  ii new student enrollments during the fiscal period  iii students who have previously withdrawn but decide to re enroll during the fiscal period  and iv graduations and withdrawals during the fiscal period 
we believe that our average student enrollments are influenced by the number of graduating high school students  the attractiveness of our program offerings to high school graduates and potential adult students  the effectiveness of our marketing efforts  the depth of our industry relationships  the strength of employment markets and long term career prospects  the quality of our instructors and student services professionals  the persistence of our students  the length of our education programs  the availability of federal funding for our programs  the number of graduates of our programs who elect to attend the advanced training programs we offer and general economic conditions 
our introduction of additional program offerings at existing schools and establishment of new schools  either through acquisition or start up  are expected to significantly influence our average student enrollment 
our average undergraduate student enrollments have grown at a compounded annual growth rate of over the past three full fiscal years 
this growth can largely be attributed to the demand for our graduates and the expansion of our capacity 
we currently offer start dates at our campuses that range from every three to six weeks throughout the year in our various undergraduate programs 
the number of start dates of advanced programs varies by the duration of those programs and the needs of the manufacturers who sponsor them 
our tuition charges vary by type or length of our programs and the program level  such as undergraduate or advanced training 
tuition has increased by approximately to per annum in each fiscal year in the three year period ended september  tuition increases are generally consistent across our schools and programs  however  changes in operating costs may impact price increases at individual locations 
we believe that we can continue to increase tuition as the demand for our graduates remains strong and tuition at other post secondary institutions continues to rise  although future increases may be less than past increases 
most students at our campuses rely on funds received under various government sponsored student financial aid programs  predominantly title iv programs  to pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education related expenses 
in our fiscal year  approximately of our net revenues were derived from federal student financial aid programs 
we extend credit for tuition and fees to the majority of our students that are in attendance at our campuses 
our credit risk is mitigated through the students participation in federally funded financial aid programs unless students withdraw prior to the receipt by us of title iv funds for those students 
any remaining tuition receivable is comprised of smaller individual amounts due from students across the united states 
we categorize our operating expenses as i educational services and facilities and ii selling  general and administrative 
major components of educational services and facilities expenses include faculty compensation and benefits  compensation and benefits of other campus administration employees  facility rent  maintenance  utilities  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment used in the provision of educational services  royalties payable to licensors under our licensing arrangements and other costs directly associated with teaching our programs and providing educational services to our students 
selling  general and administrative expenses include compensation and benefits of employees who are not directly associated with the provision of educational services  such as executive management  finance and central accounting  legal  human resources  business development  marketing and student enrollment expenses  including compensation and benefits of personnel employed in sales and marketing and student admissions  costs of professional services  bad debt expense  costs associated with the implementation and operation of our student management and reporting system  rent for our home office  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment that is not used in the provision of educational services and other costs that are incidental to our operations 
all marketing and student enrollment expenses are recognized in the period incurred 
costs related to the opening of new facilities  excluding related capital expenditures  are expensed in the period incurred or when services are provided 

table of contents costs associated with the implementation of our student management and reporting system have increased over the last several years as we installed a new integrated information network that tracks inquiries from potential students and supports our student enrollment and processing of data as it relates to our student activities 
we anticipate that we will need to continue to upgrade our student management and reporting system and expect additional costs will be incurred in connection with such an upgrade 
we believe that the investment in our student management and reporting system has improved services to students and our ability to track student inquiries and may facilitate the integration of new schools into our operations  if and when new schools are opened or acquired 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
during the preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  property and equipment  long lived assets  including goodwill  income taxes  contingent assets and liabilities and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition 
net revenues consist primarily of student tuition and fees derived from the programs we provide after reductions are made for guarantees and scholarships we sponsor 
tuition and fee revenue is recognized on a pro rata straight line basis over the term of the course or program offered 
if a student withdraws from a program prior to a specified date  any paid but unearned tuition is refunded 
approximately of our net revenues for the fiscal year and of our net revenues for the fiscal years ended and consisted of tuition 
our net revenues vary from period to period in conjunction with our average student population 
the majority of our undergraduate programs are typically designed to be completed in to months and our advanced training programs range from to weeks in duration 
we supplement our core revenues with sales of textbooks and program supplies  student housing provided by us and other revenues 
sales of textbooks and program supplies  revenue related to student housing and other revenue are each recognized as sales occur or services are performed 
deferred tuition represents the excess of tuition payments received as compared to tuition earned and is reflected as a current liability in our consolidated financial statements because it is expected to be earned within the following twelve month period 
allowance for uncollectible accounts 
we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability  failure or refusal of our students to make required payments 
we offer a variety of payment plans to help students pay that portion of their education expenses not covered by financial aid programs which are unsecured and not guaranteed 
management analyzes accounts receivable  historical percentages of uncollectible accounts  customer credit worthiness  when applicable  and changes in payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts 
we use an internal group of collectors  augmented by third party collectors as deemed appropriate  in our collection efforts 
although we believe that our reserves are adequate  if the financial condition of our students deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if we underestimate the allowances required  additional allowances may be necessary  which will result in increased selling  general and administrative expenses in the period such determination is made 

table of contents healthcare and workers compensation costs 
claims and insurance costs which primarily relate to health insurance and workers compensation are accrued using current information and  in the case of healthcare costs  future estimates provided by consultants to reasonably measure the current cost incurred for services provided but not yet invoiced 
although we believe our estimated liability recorded for healthcare and workers compensation costs are reasonable  actual results could differ and require adjustment of the recorded balance 
bonus costs 
we accrue the estimated cost of our bonus programs using current financial and statistical information as compared to targeted financial achievements and actual student graduation outcomes 
although we believe our estimated liability recorded for bonuses is reasonable  actual results could differ and require adjustment of the recorded balance 
tool sets 
we accrue the estimated cost of promotional tool sets offered to students at the time of enrollment and provided at a future date based upon satisfaction of certain criteria  including completion of certain course work 
we accrue these costs based upon current student information and an estimate of the number of students that will complete the requisite coursework 
although we believe our estimated liability for tool sets is reasonable  actual results could differ and require adjustment of the recorded balance 
long lived assets 
we record our long lived assets  such as property and equipment  at cost 
we review the carrying value of our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate these assets to determine if their current recorded value is impaired by examining estimated future cash flows 
these cash flows are evaluated by using weighted probability techniques as well as comparisons of past performance against projections 
assets may also be evaluated by identifying independent market values 
if we determine that an asset s carrying value is impaired  we will record a write down of the carrying value of the identified asset and charge the impairment as an operating expense in the period in which the determination is made 
although we believe that the carrying value of our long lived assets are appropriately stated  changes in strategy or market conditions or significant technological developments could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
goodwill 
we assess the impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  we test our goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred  by comparing its fair value to its carrying value 
impairment may result from  among other things  deterioration in the performance of the acquired business  adverse market conditions  adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations  including changes that restrict the activities of the acquired business  and a variety of other circumstances 
we utilize the present value of future cash flow approach  subject to a comparison for reasonableness to our market capitalization at the date of valuation in determining fair value 
if we determine that an impairment has occurred  we are required to record a write down of the carrying value and charge the impairment as an operating expense in the period the determination is made 
goodwill represents a significant portion of our total assets 
at september   goodwill represented approximately of our total assets  or million  and was a result of our acquisition of the parent company of our mmi operation in january although we believe goodwill is appropriately stated in our consolidated financial statements  changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an adjustment to the recorded balance 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  and comply with the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 
 which defines a fair value based method and addresses common stock and options awarded to employees as well 
table of contents as those awarded to non employees in exchange for products and services 
sfas no 
and its amendments and apb opinion no 
have been superseded by sfas no 
r  which is discussed in footnote to our consolidated financial statements and which is currently scheduled to be effective beginning with our fiscal quarter ending december  the following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
year ended september  in thousands  except per share amounts net income available to common shareholders as reported add stock based compensation expense included in reported net income  net of taxes deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined using the fair value based method  net of taxes net income pro forma earnings per share basic as reported earnings per share diluted as reported earnings per share basic pro forma earnings per share diluted pro forma accounting for income taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
we establish a valuation allowance if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
changes in the valuation allowance are included in our statement of operations as a provision for or benefit from income taxes 
we exercise significant judgment in determining our provisions for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from our deferred tax assets 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgments that could become subject to audit by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business 
as of september   we had a valuation allowance of million to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that management believes is more likely than not realizable 
the valuation allowance primarily relates to a deferred tax asset arising from a capital loss carryforward from the sale of a discontinued business and expires in should we incur capital gains in the future  we would be able to realize all or part of the capital loss carryforward against which we have applied the valuation allowance 
in that event  our current income tax expense would be reduced or our income tax benefits would be increased  resulting in an increase in net income or a reduction in net loss 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement replaces sfas no

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
r eliminates the alternative to use apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in statement no 
as originally issued 
in the first quarter of  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
which provided further clarification on the implementation of sfas no 
r 

table of contents sfas no 
r requires the measurement and recording of the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments to be based on the grant date fair value of the award and prescribes either the modified prospective or the modified retrospective transition method of adoption 
we have opted to utilize the modified prospective transition method of adoption  which results in recognition of compensation expense for all stock option and other equity based awards that vest or become exercisable after the effective date  as opposed to the modified retrospective transition method which provides for retroactive restatement 
the cost associated with grant awards will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
sfas no 
r was to be effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning on or after june   however  the securities and exchange commission announced in april that it was extending the date for compliance with sfas r  such that sfas no 
r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim reporting period of our first fiscal year beginning on or after june  the first interim period of our first fiscal year beginning on or after june  will be the quarter ending december  we estimate the effect of adopting sfas no 
r  based upon outstanding equity awards as of september   will be approximately million for our fiscal year  which begins october  this estimate does not include the impact of additional equity awards which may be granted or forfeitures which may occur subsequent to september  and prior to our adoption of sfas no

fin clarifies the manner in which uncertainties concerning the timing and method of settlement of an asset retirement obligation should be accounted for and when the fair value of an asset retirement obligation is deemed to be estimable on a reasonable basis 
fin is effective for fiscal years ending after december  we believe our adoption of fin will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures

 accounting changes and error corrections 
this statement replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
the intent of sfas no 
is to improve financial reporting by enhancing the consistency of financial information between periods 
sfas no 
also provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we believe our adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures

table of contents we invested approximately million for our campus expansion at our glendale heights  illinois campus 
we invested approximately million for leasehold improvements and training equipment for the addition of an automotive training program at our existing orlando  florida campus 
capital expenditures are expected to increase as we upgrade and expand current equipment and facilities or open new facilities as part of our strategic plans 
we plan to be able to fund these capital expenditures with cash generated from operations 
the following is a summary of our current material capital expenditure commitments in october  we entered into a long term  real property lease agreement for a acre parcel of land in sacramento  california

for a description of additional related party transactions  see item certain relationships and related transactions 
seasonality our net revenues and operating results normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business  principally due to changes in total student population and costs associated with opening or expanding our campuses 
student population varies as a result of new student enrollments  graduations and student attrition 
historically  our schools have had lower student populations in our third fiscal quarter than in the remainder of our fiscal year because fewer students are enrolled during the summer months 
our expenses  however  do not vary significantly with changes in student population and net revenues and  as a result  such expenses do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of seasonal enrollment patterns 
such patterns may change  however  as a result of new school openings  new program introductions  increased enrollments of adult students or acquisitions 
in addition  our net revenues for the first fiscal quarter are adversely affected by the fact that we do not recognize revenue during the calendar year end holiday break  which falls primarily in that quarter

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk historically  our principal exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates 
however  we repaid substantially all of our long term debt in december with a portion of the net proceeds of our initial public offering 
consequently  we believe that we currently have minimal financial exposure to market risk 
effect of inflation to date  inflation has not had a significant effect on our operations
