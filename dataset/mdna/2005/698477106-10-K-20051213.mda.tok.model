item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations general the company s principal line of business is the production and sale of oil and natural gas 
results of operations are dependent upon the quantity of production and the price obtained for such production 
prices received by the company for the sale of its oil and natural gas have fluctuated significantly from period to period 
such fluctuations affect the company s ability to maintain or increase its production from existing oil and gas properties and to explore  develop or acquire new properties 
the recent and continuing increase in oil and gas prices have provided and should continue to provide increased drilling opportunities  which should then translate into increased production volumes for the company 
the following table reflects certain operating data for the periods presented for the year ended september  percent percent incr or decr incr or decr production oil bbls gas mcf average sales price oil per bbl gas per mcf compared to overview the company recorded net income of  in  compared to net income of  in revenues and consequently net income were larger as a result of increased oil and gas sales revenues generated by significant increases in the average sales prices of oil and natural gas in as compared to it currently appears oil and gas sales prices will remain at these or increased 
table of contents levels for at least the next year 
in addition  the company was able to increase lease bonus revenue by approximately  in  the result of an industry wide increase in drilling activity brought on by the increased market price of oil and gas 
revenues total revenues increased to  in compared to  in the majority of the increase was due to increases in the average sales price for oil and natural gas in per the above chart 
new production from the company s drilling activity more than replaced the normal production decline of existing gas wells and the sale in of approximately on an annualized basis of the company s gas production 
these sales of non core assets were accomplished throughout gas production increased for the year in spite of the sales 
oil wells beginning production in could not replace the decline in existing oil production 
as the company is concentrating on the drilling of gas wells  this trend of increasing gas production and decreasing oil production is expected to continue 
lease bonus revenue increased  in  substantially all of which is due to the leasing of all of the company s non producing mineral acreage in arkansas 
the total lease bonus  net of associated basis  for the approximate  arkansas acres was  lease operating expenses and production taxes loe loe continues to increase each year due to increases in the number of working interest wells in which the company has an interest  increasing repairs and maintenance needed for existing older wells and normal inflation of costs 
actual well operating costs were  in as compared to  in gross production taxes are paid as a percentage of oil and gas sales revenues and therefore increased in to  an increase of  over exploration costs exploration costs increased  or in as compared to since the company utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas operations  only exploratory dry holes result in their costs being charged to exploration costs 
in  there were no high cost exploratory dry holes as compared to two such wells in depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a dd a increased  or in as compared to increased dd a expenses in  as compared to  are a result of rapid decline rates on many wells which have been drilled and gone on production in the last two years coupled with higher costs on these recently completed wells  which then must be depreciated 
the high initial production rates result in an inordinate amount of the wells total estimated reserves being produced rapidly  which then causes the units of production dd a being heavily weighted to the front end of these wells lives 
provision for impairment the provision for impairment decreased  or in as compared to the decrease in impairment charges was principally the result of increased market prices for oil and natural gas 
higher market prices dramatically change the economic evaluation of properties and the calculation of potential impairment

subsequent to fiscal year end  the company s board of directors voted to amend the plan to provide future payment only in common stock of the company 
that change will eliminate the requirement to adjust the liability for changes in market price of the company s common stock for and future fiscal periods 
interest expense interest expense decreased  or in because of lower average outstanding debt balances 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased in due to a substantial increase in income before taxes as discussed above 
the company continued to be able to utilize excess percentage depletion on its oil and gas properties to reduce its tax liability  and its effective tax rate from the federal and state statutory rates 
the effective tax rate was approximately in  in and in liquidity and capital resources at september   the company had positive working capital of  as compared to  at september  cash at september  amounted to  the increase in working capital and cash at september  compared to september  was the result of increased oil and gas sales revenues during which is the company s primary source of cash 
cash flow from operating activities increased to  for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the increase in oil and gas sales prices 
capital expenditures for oil and gas activities primarily drilling and equipment costs on wells for was  as compared to  for the company has historically funded its capital expenditures  overhead costs and dividend payments from operating cash flow 
due to the increased capital expenditure level in  the company borrowed  from time to time  on its revolving bank loan to help fund those expenditures 
however  as a result of increased cash flow from higher prices received for natural gas and oil in  the company was able to reduce its bank debt by a net of  the company expects to moderately increase its capital expenditure level in funds for capital expenditures are expected to come from cash flow and bank debt  if needed 
approximately million is available under the company s current bank debt facility for capital expenditures and acquisitions 
further  the credit facility could be increased  if needed  for a large acquisition 
cash flow from oil and gas sales is expected to increase in as average oil and gas sales prices for currently are expected to exceed levels 
thus  the company expects to generate cash flow in excess of expected budgeted needs 
however  unexpected declines in oil or natural gas sales prices would significantly reduce cash flow 

table of contents contractual obligations the company has a credit facility with bancfirst  oklahoma city  oklahoma 
the facility consists of a term loan of  and a revolving loan of  which is subject to a semi annual borrowing base determination 
the current borrowing base under the facility is  the term loan matures on april   and the revolving loan matures on march  monthly payments on the term loan are  plus accrued interest  beginning on may  borrowings under the revolving loan are due at maturity 
interest on the term loan is fixed at until maturity 
the revolving loan bears interest at the national prime rate minus at september  or libor for one  three or six month periods  plus 
at september   the company had no balance outstanding under this facility 
total outstanding borrowings under both the term loan and the revolving line of credit may not exceed the borrowing base  which was million at september  subsequent determinations of the borrowing base are made semi annually or whenever the bank  in its sole discretion  believes that there has been a material change in the value of the oil and gas properties 
the loan agreement contains customary covenants which  among other things  require periodic financial and reserve reporting and limit the company s incurrence of indebtedness  liens  dividends and acquisitions of treasury stock 
other covenants require the company to maintain certain financial ratios 
at september   the company was in compliance with the covenants

table of contents critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
however  the accounting principles used by the company generally do not change the company s reported cash flows or liquidity 
generally  accounting rules do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve a selection of the appropriate policies for applying the basic principles 
interpretation of the existing rules must be done and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to the company 
the more significant reporting areas impacted by management s judgments and estimates are crude oil and natural gas reserve estimation  impairment of assets  oil and gas sales revenue accruals and tax accruals 
management s judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources  including engineers  geologists and historical experience in similar matters 
actual results could differ from the estimates as additional information becomes known 
the oil and gas sales revenue accrual is particularly subject to estimates due to the company s status as a non operator on all of its properties 
production information obtained from well operators is substantially delayed 
this causes the estimation of recent production  used in the oil and gas revenue accrual  to be subject to some variations 
oil and gas reserves of these judgments and estimates  management considers the estimation of crude oil and nature gas reserves to be the most significant 
these estimates affect the unaudited standardized measure disclosures  as well as dd a and impairment calculations 
changes in crude oil and natural gas reserve estimates affect the company s calculation of depreciation  depletion and amortization  provision for abandonment and assessment of the need for asset impairments 
on an annual basis  with a limited scope semi annual update  the company s consulting engineer  with assistance from company geologists  prepares estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves based on available geologic and seismic data  reservoir pressure data  core analysis reports  well logs  analogous reservoir performance history  production data and other available sources of engineering  geological and geophysical information 
as required by the guidelines and definitions established by the sec  these estimates are based on current crude oil and natural gas pricing 
crude oil and natural gas prices are volatile and largely affected by worldwide production and consumption and are outside the control of management 
projected future crude oil and natural gas pricing assumptions are used by management to prepare estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves used in formulating management s overall operating decisions in the exploration and production segment 
successful efforts method of accounting the company has elected to utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and development activities 
exploration expenses  including geological and geophysical costs  rentals and exploratory dry holes  are charged against income as incurred 
costs of successful wells and related production equipment and developmental dry holes are capitalized and amortized by property using the unit of production method as oil and gas is produced 
this accounting method may yield significantly different operating results than the full cost method 

table of contents impairment of assets all long lived assets  principally oil and gas properties  are monitored for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may be greater than its future net cash flows 
the evaluations involve significant judgment since the results are based on estimated future events  such as inflation rates  future sales prices for oil and gas  future production costs  estimates of future oil and gas reserves to be recovered and the timing thereof  the economic and regulatory climates and other factors 
the need to test a property for impairment may result from significant declines in sales prices or unfavorable adjustments to oil and gas reserves 
any assets held for sale are reviewed for impairment when the company approves the plan to sell 
estimates of anticipated sales prices are highly judgmental and subject to material revision in future periods 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors  the company can not predict when or if future impairment charges will be recorded 
oil and gas sales revenue accrual the company does not operate any of its oil and gas properties  and it primarily holds small interests in several thousand wells 
thus  obtaining timely production data from the well operators is extremely difficult 
this requires the company to utilize past production receipts to estimate its oil and gas sales revenue accrual at the end of each quarterly period 
the oil and gas accrual can be impacted by many variables  including initial high production rates of new wells and subsequent rapid decline rates of those wells 
this could lead to an over or under accrual of oil and gas sales at the end of any particular quarter 
based on past history  the estimated accrual has been materially accurate 
income taxes the estimation of the amounts of income tax to be recorded by the company involves interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations as well as the completion of complex calculations  including the determination of the company s percentage depletion deduction 
although the company s management believes its tax accruals are adequate  differences may occur in the future depending on the resolution of pending and new tax matters 
the above description of the company s critical accounting policies is not intended to be an all inclusive discussion of the uncertainties considered and estimates made by management in applying accounting principles and policies 
results may vary significantly if different policies were used or required and if new or different information becomes known to management 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s results of operations and operating cash flows can be significantly impacted by changes in market prices for oil and gas 
based on the company s production  a 
per mcf change in the price received for natural gas production would result in a corresponding  annual change in pre tax operating cash flow 
a per barrel change in the price received for oil production would result in a corresponding  annual change in pre tax operating cash flow 
cash flows could also be impacted  to a lesser extent  by changes in the market interest rates related to the revolving credit facility which bears interest at an annual variable interest rate equal to either the national prime rate minus or libor for one  three or six month periods  plus 
however  at september   the company had no balance outstanding under this facility 
the company has a  term loan with an outstanding balance of  at september  maturing on april  the interest rate is fixed at until maturity
