the purpose of this discussion is to highlight significant changes in the financial condition and results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries during the past three years  and provide supplemental information and analysis 
certain amounts in the and prior years financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in unless otherwise noted  all dollars are expressed in thousands except per share data 
use of non gaap financial measures certain information discussed below is presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
specifically  included in  and net interest income was   and  of tax exempt interest income from certain tax exempt investment securities and loans 
an amount equal to the tax benefit derived from this tax exempt income has been added back to the interest income and net interest income totals discussed in this management s discussion and analysis  resulting in tax equivalent adjustments of  and  in  and  respectively 
the analysis of net interest income tables included in this annual report on form k provide a reconciliation of tax equivalent financial information to the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
management believes the disclosure of tax equivalent net interest income information improves the clarity of financial analysis  and is particularly useful to investors in understanding and evaluating the changes and trends in the company s results of operations 
other financial institutions commonly present net interest income on a tax equivalent basis 
this adjustment is considered helpful in the comparison of one financial institution s net interest income to that of another institution  as each will have a different proportion of tax exempt interest from their earning asset portfolios 
moreover  net interest income is a component of a second financial measure commonly used by financial institutions  net interest margin  which is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets 
for purposes of this measure as well  other financial institutions generally use tax equivalent net interest income to provide a better basis of comparison from institution to institution 
the company follows these practices

one of the principal goals underlying the restructuring plan was to simplify and more closely align the company s brand names and operating model without diminishing functionality 
the company anticipates the changes will enable it to improve customer service  broaden its product offerings  and achieve increased operating efficiencies

outlook the challenges facing the company as we entered were similar to those identified in the prior year  namely loan and deposit growth  credit quality  interest rate risk  and risk management processes 
in addition to these challenges  the company must grow revenues and control expenses while managing an increasing regulatory burden 
these are challenges the company has met for many years while serving the citizens and businesses in the markets it serves  and the company expects similar results over the next twelve months 
the year brought the banking world much volatility and uncertainty 
short term interest rates increased with the fed tightening five times  while the year treasury fluctuated between and  ending the year at 
while short term interest rates were increasing during the second half of the year  the opposite was true for longer term rates  causing a dramatic flattening of the us treasury yield curve as we ended as we head into  growth in net interest income will depend on many factors including how quickly  and by how much  the federal reserve will continue to tighten and the effect on the rest of the yield curve  whether the economy will continue on the road to recovery and at what pace  and the impact of a potentially inverted yield curve on the net interest margin 
the current and projected shape of the yield curve will be key factors driving the company s net interest income in  and continued earning asset growth will likely be necessary in generating meaningful increases 
though these developments have not had a materially adverse affect on the company to date  the company continues to monitor them closely and believes it is adequately positioned for a variety of future interest rate scenarios 
reflecting trends in the national and regional economies  the company s market area generally witnessed steady economic growth during as we head into  the economies and real estate markets in the company s primary market areas will continue to be significant determinants of the quality of the company s assets in future periods and  thus  its results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition 
the company believes future economic activity will in part depend on stronger employment  consumer confidence  personal consumption expenditures  and business expenditures for new capital equipment 
other factors  which could affect the company s financial performance and that of its common stock  are more fully enumerated in the forward looking statements discussion at the beginning of this annual report on form k 
application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition are based on the consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for loan losses  on an ongoing basis 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis in making judgments about the carrying values of assets that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the amount derived from management s estimates and assumptions under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully enumerated in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the reader of the financial statements should review these policies to gain a greater understanding of how the company s financial performance is reported 
management believes the following critical accounting policies represent the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements allowance for loan losses management believes the allowance for loan losses allowance is a significant accounting estimate used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the allowance  which is established through a provision for loan loss expense  is based on management s evaluation of the level of allowance required in relation to the estimated inherent risk of loss in the loan portfolio 
management regularly evaluates the allowance for loan losses for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as previous loss experience  the size and composition of the portfolio  current economic and real estate market conditions and the performance of individual loans in relation to contract terms and estimated fair values of collateral 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for loan losses 
a smaller provision for loan losses results in higher net income and when larger provisions for loan losses are necessary  the result is lower net income 
refer to part ii  item  allowance for loan losses and provision  in this annual report on form k  for further discussion and analysis concerning the allowance 
income taxes the company estimates its income taxes for each period for which a statement of income is presented 
this involves estimating the company s actual current tax liability  as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from differing timing of recognition of expenses  income and tax credits  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recovered from historical taxes paid and future taxable income and  to the extent that the recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense  and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of december  and  there was no valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  which are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
interest income recognition on loans interest income on loans is included in income as earned based upon the unpaid principal balance of the loan 
the company s policy is to discontinue the accrual of interest  and to reverse any uncollected interest recorded on loans  when scheduled payments become contractually past due in excess of days or  in the judgment of management  the ultimate collectibility of principal or interest becomes doubtful 
goodwill and other intangible assets the valuation technique used by the company to determine the carrying value of tangible and intangible assets acquired in acquisitions and the estimated lives of identifiable intangible assets involve estimates for discount rates  projected future cash flows and time period calculations  all of which are susceptible to change based upon changes in economic conditions and other factors 
any changes in the estimates used by the company to determine the carrying value of its goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  or which otherwise adversely affect their value or estimated lives  would adversely affect the company s results of operations 
refer to notes and of the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for further details of the company s accounting policies and estimates covering goodwill and other intangible assets

the bank anticipates continued loan growth in this market area 
at december   consumer and commercial real estate loans comprised of the loan portfolio  compared with at december  the continued strength in the local real estate markets  both residential and commercial  has led to historically high property values in the bank s market area 
recognizing the impact this trend may have on the loan portfolio and origination pipeline  the bank periodically reviews its underwriting standards in an effort to ensure that the quality of the loan portfolio is not jeopardized by unrealistic loan to value ratios or debt service levels

management follows a policy of continually identifying  analyzing and grading credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
an ongoing independent review  subsequent to management s review  of individual credits is performed by an independent loan review function  which reports to the audit committee of the board of directors 
management recognizes that early and accurate recognition of risk is the best means to reduce credit losses and maximize earnings 
the bank employs a comprehensive risk management structure to identify and manage the risk of loss 
for consumer loans  the bank identifies loan delinquency beginning at day delinquency and provides appropriate follow up by written correspondence or personal contact 
non residential mortgage consumer losses are recognized no later than the point at which a loan is days past due 
residential mortgage losses are recognized during the foreclosure process  or sooner  when that loss is quantifiable and reasonably assured 
for commercial loans the bank applies a risk grading system  which stratifies the portfolio and allows management to focus appropriate efforts on the highest risk components of the portfolio 
the risk grades include ratings that correlate with regulatory definitions of pass  other assets especially mentioned  substandard  doubtful  and loss 
as a result of management s ongoing review of the loan portfolio  loans are placed on non accrual status  either due to the delinquent status of principal and or interest  or a judgment by management that  although payments of principal and or interest are current  such action is prudent because collection in full of all outstanding principal and interest is in doubt 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when principal and or interest is days overdue 
consumer loans are generally charged off when principal and or interest payments are days overdue 
non performing loans non performing loans npls include loans on non accrual status  loans that have been treated as troubled debt restructurings  and loans past due days or more and still accruing interest

at december  non performing loans represented of total loans compared with at december  during  the bank maintained its non performing loans at significantly lower levels compared with prior years 
the bank attributes this success to a continued strengthening of its credit administration processes and underwriting standards  aided by a stable local economy and a still favorable interest rate environment 
the bank maintains a centralized loan collection and managed asset department  providing timely and effective collection efforts for problem loans 
while the non performing loan ratios continued to reflect the favorable quality of the loan portfolio during the year ended december   the bank is cognizant of soft economic conditions overall  and is managing credit risk accordingly 
future levels of non performing loans may be influenced by economic conditions  including the impact of those conditions on the bank s customers  interest rates  and other factors existing at the time 
management believes the economic activity and conditions in the local real estate markets will continue to be significant determinants of the quality of the loan portfolio in future periods and  thus  the company s results of operations and financial condition 
allowance for loan losses at december  the allowance for loan losses allowance stood at  compared with  at december   representing a decrease of  or 
the allowance is available to absorb losses on loans 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance and provisioning for estimated losses is evaluated quarterly based on review of loans  with particular emphasis on non performing and other loans that management believes warrant special consideration 
the bank s board of directors reviews the evaluation of the allowance to ensure its adequacy 
the allowance is maintained at a level that  in management s judgment  is appropriate for the amount of risk inherent in the current loan portfolio  and adequate to provide for estimated losses 
reserves are established for specific loans including impaired loans  a pool of reserves based on historical charge offs by loan types  and supplemental reserves that adjust historical loss experience to reflect current economic conditions  industry specific risks  and other observable data 
loan loss provisions are recorded based upon overall aggregate data  and the allowance is increased when  on an aggregate basis  additional estimated losses are identified and deemed likely 
no portion of the allowance is restricted to any loan or group of loans  and the entire allowance is available to absorb realized losses 
the amount and timing of realized losses and future allowance allocations could vary from current estimates 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  changing economic conditions and the economic prospects of the borrowers may necessitate future additions or reductions to the allowance 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance  which also may necessitate future additions or reductions to the allowance  based on information available to them at the time of their examination

general reserves account for the risk and estimated loss inherent in certain pools of industry and geographic loan concentrations within the loan portfolio 
there were no major changes loan concentrations during the december  allowance calculation incorporates loss estimates relating to loans to borrowers involved in the maine wild blueberry industry  principally centered in washington county  maine 
during the fourth quarter of  certain legal matters developed regarding the blueberry industry  the uncertainties of which warranted recognition of certain increases in credit risk 
while recent developments have been favorable  at december  the adequacy analysis of the allowance incorporated management s estimate of inherent risk of loss with respect to loans associated with this industry segment 
specific reserves for impaired loans are determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
the amount of loans considered to be impaired totaled as of december   compared with as of december  the related allowances for loan losses on these impaired loans amounted to and  as of december  and december   respectively 
the bank had no troubled debt restructurings at december   and all of its impaired loans were considered collateral dependent and were adequately reserved 
management reviews impaired loans to ensure such loans are transferred to interest non accrual status  and written down when necessary 
the amount of interest income not recorded on impaired loans amounted to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
based upon the process employed and giving recognition to all attendant factors associated with the loan portfolio  the company considers the allowance for loan losses at december  to be appropriate for the risks inherent in the loan portfolio  and resident in the local and national economy as of that date 
investment securities the investment securities portfolio represented of the company s average earning assets during and generated of total interest income  compared with and in  respectively 
the investment securities portfolio is primarily comprised of mortgaged backed securities issued by us government sponsored enterprises and agencies  and other corporate issuers 
the portfolio also includes tax exempt obligations of state and political subdivisions  and obligations of other government sponsored enterprises 
the overall objective of the bank s strategy for the investment securities portfolio is to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity  diversify earning assets  manage interest rate risk  leverage the bank s strong capital position  and generate acceptable levels of net interest income 
the investment securities portfolio is managed under the policy guidelines established by the bank s board of directors 
total investment securities at december  total investment securities stood at  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
the average investment securities balance amounted to  compared with  in  representing an increase of  or comparing with  the year over year growth in average investment securities outpaced the period end growth  reflecting a redeployment of cash flows from the securities portfolio in support of strong loan growth and expected seasonal deposit outflows 
the growth in average investment securities principally occurred during the second quarter of securities added to the portfolio predominately consisted of mortgage backed securities with average durations ranging between two and three years 
this action was taken as market yields climbed to a two year high  presenting some patiently awaited opportunities for the bank to increase its earning assets and leverage its strong capital position 
given the historically low interest rate environment and the associated level of interest rate risk  during the bank exercised restraint by not increasing the investment securities portfolio compared with in light of the low interest rate environment over the past few years and the historically high degree of interest rate volatility  the bank s investment strategy has been focused on maintaining a securities portfolio with an overall relatively short average duration  thereby reducing the exposures associated with sustained increases in interest rates 
this was accomplished through investments in securities with predictable cash flows and relatively short average lives such as  year fully amortizing mortgage backed securities and other high coupon mortgage backed securities 
the bank s strategy has been to position the securities portfolio defensively with a steady stream of future cash flows 
while sacrificing some yield in the near term  the bank s objectives were to maintain a reasonable level of net interest income  manage longer term interest rate and market risks  and position the portfolio for a rising interest rate environment and an improving economy 
trading securities trading securities are securities bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term with the objective of generating profits on short term differences in price 
as of december  and  the bank did not have any trading securities 
securities available for sale the designation of securities available for sale is made at the time of purchase  based upon management s intent to hold the securities for an indefinite time  however  these securities would be available for sale in response to changes in market interest rates  related changes in the securities prepayment risk  needs for liquidity  or changes in the availability of and yield on alternative investments 
investment securities classified as available for sale are reported at their fair value with unrealized gains or losses  net of taxes  excluded from earnings but shown separately as a component of shareholders equity 
gains and losses on the sale of securities available for sale are determined using the specific identification method and are shown separately in the statement of income 
the securities available for sale portfolio is managed on a total return basis with the objective of exceeding the return that would be experienced if investing solely in us treasury instruments 
the securities available for sale portfolio is used for liquidity purposes while simultaneously producing earnings 
securities available for sale totaled  at december   compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  during the fourth quarter of the bank transferred into the available for sale securities portfolio all of its held to maturity investment securities 
securities transferred consisted of longer term  tax exempt securities representing obligations of state and political subdivisions 
the held to maturity securities were transferred to available for sale at their fair value of  with an unrealized gain on these securities  net of taxes  amounting to  recorded in other comprehensive income  a separate component of shareholders equity 
the transfer of held to maturity securities to available for sale was consistent with the bank s asset and liability management strategies  particularly the management of interest rate risk and the need for adequate liquidity 
the majority of the held to maturity securities transferred to available for sale were purchased in  during a period of higher long term interest rates  and then current projections for even higher rates in the near future 
given the current interest rate environment and the shortening of maturities since their date of purchase  the degree of interest rate risk associated with the held to maturity securities transferred to available for sale has diminished significantly 
management believes the transfer of held to maturity securities to available for sale will provide the bank with additional liquidity reserves and a higher degree of flexibility in managing the overall balance sheet 
management does not intend to utilize the held to maturity classification in the foreseeable future 
the balances of securities available for sale are stated on the consolidated balance sheet net of fair value adjustments  reflecting net unrealized gains of  and at december  and  respectively 
the increase in unrealized gains was principally attributed to the transfer of held to maturity securities to available for sale  which at december  amounted to  the following table summarizes the securities available for sale portfolio as of december   and december  gross gross estimated amortized unrealized unrealized fair available for sale cost gains losses value obligations to us government sponsored enterprises mortgage backed securities us government agencies and sponsored enterprises other obligations of states of the us and political subdivisions thereof other bonds total securities available for sale december  gross gross estimated amortized unrealized unrealized fair available for sale cost gains losses value obligations to us government sponsored enterprises mortgage backed securities us government agencies and sponsored enterprises other other bonds total securities available for sale securities held to maturity the securities held to maturity htm portfolio has historically been managed for yield and earnings generation  liquidity through cash flow  and interest rate risk characteristics within the framework of the entire balance sheet 
investment securities held to maturity are those where the bank has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity 
held to maturity investments are reported at their aggregate cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts 
as previously discussed  during the fourth quarter of the bank transferred all securities held to maturity to available for sale 
at december   securities held to maturity totaled  representing of total investment securities at that date 
the following table summarizes the securities held to maturity portfolio since securities held to maturity at december at book value mortgage backed securities obligations of state and political subdivisions total at december   the htm portfolio consisted exclusively of long term  tax exempt municipal bonds  with one exception  namely  one mortgage backed security mbs originally purchased in for community reinvestment act cra benefits  with an original par value of  the underlying collateral consisted of low income housing loans in the state of maine 
by their nature  cra investments typically have higher purchase premiums because of the positive cra effect 
subsequent to the purchase  the bank s primary regulator advised that the mbs did not qualify for cra credit because the loans were not in the bank s immediate market area  in effect diminishing the value of the investment security to the bank 
during  the bank sold this cra investment security  which had a then current book value of  realizing a gain of purchase premiums and discounts securities are typically purchased at premium or discounted price  depending on the coupon of the security and prevailing interest rates 
the company recognizes the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts in interest income using the interest method over the estimated life of the security 
purchase premiums are amortized to the earliest call date  while purchase discounts are accreted to maturity 
premiums paid on mortgage backed securities are amortized proportionate to the three month trailing average constant payment rate cpr of each securitized pool of mortgages 
securities credit risk the bank evaluates and monitors the credit risk of its investment securities utilizing a variety of resources including external credit rating agencies  predominantly moody s and standard and poor s 
at december   of the investment portfolio was rated aaa 
the bank held no investment securities having a credit rating below a as of december  securities interest income during the total aggregate tax equivalent yield on the investment securities portfolio amounted to  compared with in  representing a decline of basis points 
the declining interest rate environment over the past few years has prompted increases in prepayment speeds on mortgage backed securities particularly those with higher coupons  an acceleration of premium amortization  and the exercise of call features on certain securities 
securities replaced or incrementally added to the investment securities portfolio during and had relatively short average lives and consequently  were lower yielding compared with historical levels 
total tax equivalent interest income from investment securities amounted to  in  compared with  in  representing an increase of  or 
the impact of the decrease in yields on interest income was more than offset by a year over year increase in the volume of average investment securities 
securities maturity distribution the following table summarizes the maturity distribution of the amortized cost of the bank s investment securities and weighted average yields of such securities an a fully tax equivalent basis as of december   based upon the final maturity date of the securities 
expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or pre pay certain securities 
in the case of mortgage backed securities  actual maturities may also differ from expected maturities due to the amortizing nature of the underlying mortgage collateral  and the fact that borrowers in most cases have the right to prepay

in evaluating whether an impairment is other than temporary  management considers a variety of factors including the nature of the investment  the cause of the impairment  and the severity and duration of the impairment 
other data considered by management includes  for example  sector credit ratings  volatility of the security s market price  and any other information considered relevant in determining whether other than temporary impairment has occurred 
at december   management determined there were no unrealized losses in the investment securities portfolio that were other than temporary

as of december   unrealized losses on investment securities that had been in an unrealized loss position more than twelve months amounted to  or of their carrying value at december  at december  there were a total of thirty one investment securities in an unrealized loss position more than twelve months  represented by twenty nine mortgage backed securities and two debt securities issued by government sponsored enterprises 
for securities with unrealized losses  the following information was considered in determining that the impairments are not other than temporary 
us government securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states and therefore bear no credit risk 
us government sponsored enterprises have minimal credit risk as they play a vital role in the nation s financial markets 
other bonds and notes are generally comprised of corporate mortgage backed securities and all investments maintain a credit rating of at least a by one of the nationally recognized rating agencies 
mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are either issued by federal government agencies and sponsored enterprises  or by private issuers  all with security ratings of aaa 
management believes the unrealized losses in the investment portfolio at december  were attributed to interest rates  and reflected the volatile movements in the us treasury curve over the past few years 
specifically  certain debt securities were purchased in an interest rate environment lower than where the us treasury yield curve stood on december management believes the extent of unrealized losses on mortgage backed securities will diminish over time as principal payments and pre payments are received and maturities continue to shorten 
in the case of debt securities  management believes unrealized losses will diminish over time as maturity dates continue to shorten 
management also believes that any declines in the us treasury yield curve will further diminish the extent of unrealized losses in the securities portfolio  as market values typically increase in a declining interest rate environment 
subsequent to december  the yield curve posted declines  with the year treasury  for example  closing as low as  or basis points lower than where it stood at year end 
funding sources the bank utilizes various traditional sources of funding to support its earning asset portfolios 
funding sources principally consist of customer deposits and  to a lesser extent  borrowings from the federal home loan bank of boston fhlb of which it is a member  and certificates of deposit obtained from the national market 
historically  the banking business in the bank s market area has been seasonal  with lower deposits in the winter and spring and higher deposits in the summer and fall 
these seasonal swings have been fairly predictable and have not had a materially adverse impact on the bank 
seasonal swings in deposits have been typically absorbed by the bank s strong liquidity position  including borrowing lines from the fhlb and cash flows from the investment securities portfolio 
among maine banks  strong loan growth has not been matched by core deposit growth  which according to a recent report prepared by the maine bureau of financial institutions  increased a relatively anemic during the twelve months ended june   the lowest growth rate in five years 
as a consequence  among maine banks  the loan to core deposit ratio rose to a record high of  well above the national average of and up from one year earlier 
during  the bank s average loan to core deposit ratio amounted to  compared with in at december  the bank s loan to core deposit ratio stood at  in part reflecting the seasonality of customer deposits and fourth quarter loan growth of according to the maine bureau of finanical institutions  because core deposit growth has not kept pace with earning asset growth  maine banks have had to rely increasingly on borrowings and other types of non core funding  which supported of maine bank assets as of june   compared with the national average of 
during the bank s non core funding averaged of total average assets  compared with in at december  the bank s non core funding stood at  compared with at december  looking forward  management believes that the bank s success in growing core funding will be a determinant factor in its ability to grow earning assets and leverage its strong capital position

during  the bank began offering a new institutional money market product to clients of bar harbor trust services  the bank s wholly owned subsidiary 
during the balance of this new money market product averaged  and at december   totaled  the growth in savings and money market accounts was also driven by the deposits acquired in connection with the bank s acquisition of a branch office in the community of rockland  maine 
during  which saw a continuation of historically low interest rates  customers appeared to demonstrate a desire for the higher liquidity offered through savings and money market accounts  versus more traditional  longer term certificates of deposit

the increase in deposits obtained from the national market was primarily attributed to the funding needs associated with the bank s strong earning asset growth  principally loans  which outpaced core customer deposit growth during the rates of interest paid on time deposits obtained from the national market were generally more favorable than advances from the federal home loan bank  a secondary source of funding used by the bank 
excluding time deposits obtained from the national market  total time deposits at december  represented an increase  or  compared with december  this increase was principally attributed to deposits acquired in connection with the bank s acquisition of a branch office in the community of rockland  maine 
the sluggish organic growth in customer time deposits was due in part to depositors apparent hesitation to invest in longer term fixed rate certificates of deposits  while yields remained at historically low levels 
additionally  in light of the extended low interest rate environment and its resulting pressure on the bank s net interest margin  during the bank did not compete for time deposits as aggressively as it has in the past  with respect to pricing 
in pricing time deposits  particularly non relationship time deposits  the bank will consider other sources of funding which may be offered at more attractive terms and prices  including borrowed funds and time deposits available in the national market 
time deposits in denominations of or greater totaled  at december   compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
the following schedule summarizes the maturity distribution of time deposits of or greater maturity schedule time deposits thousand or greater december  maturity three months or less over three months to six months over six months to twelve months over twelve months borrowed funds borrowed funds principally consist of advances from the federal home loan bank of boston fhlb and  to a lesser extent  securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
advances from the fhlb are secured by stock in the fhlb  mortgage backed securities  and blanket liens on qualifying first mortgage loans 
the bank utilizes borrowed funds in leveraging its strong capital position and supporting its earning asset portfolios 
borrowed funds are principally utilized to support the bank s investment securities portfolio and  to a lesser extent  fund loan growth 
borrowed funds also provide a means to help manage balance sheet interest rate risk  given the bank s ability to select desired amounts  terms and maturities on a daily basis

during the fourth quarter of  the bank replaced a portion of its maturing fhlb borrowings with certificates of deposit obtained in the national market  causing the balance of fhlb borrowings at december  to fall below the average balance 
the increase in borrowings from the fhlb was utilized to fund earning asset growth  particularly the growth in the bank s investment securities portfolio 
borrowings from the fhlb expressed as a percentage of total assets amounted to at december   compared with at december  borrowing maturities borrowing maturities are managed in concert with the bank s asset and liability management strategies  and are closely aligned with the ongoing management of balance sheet interest rate risk 
over the past few years  the bank has added longer term borrowings to the balance sheet in order to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the growth in longer term  fixed rate  earning assets generated during periods of historically low interest rates 
while this strategy has pressured net interest income in the short term  management believes it better positions the bank for rising interest rates and an improving economy 
as of december   total short term borrowings  including securities sold under repurchase agreements  amounted to  compared with  at december   or and of total borrowings  respectively 
conversely  long term borrowings at december  totaled  compared with  at december   or and of total borrowings  respectively 
capital resources consistent with its long term goal of operating a sound and profitable organization  the company continues to be a well capitalized bank holding company according to applicable regulatory standards 
in  the company continued to maintain a strong capital position  which is vital in promoting depositor and investor confidence and providing a solid foundation for future growth 
historically  most of the company s capital requirements have been provided through retained earnings and this continued to be the case during the year ended december  stock repurchase plans in november  the company announced a stock repurchase plan 
the board of directors of the company at that time authorized open market and privately negotiated purchases of up to of the company s outstanding shares of common stock  or  shares

as of december   the company had repurchased  shares of stock under this plan  at a total cost of  and an average price of per share 
the company believes that a stock repurchase plan is a prudent use of capital at this time 
management anticipates the stock repurchase plan will be accretive to the return on average shareholders equity and earnings per share

the dividend was payable to all shareholders of record as of february   and was paid on march  capital ratios the company and its banking subsidiary are subject to the risk based capital guidelines administered by the bank s principal regulators 
the risk based capital guidelines are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies  to account for off balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
under these guidelines  assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories  each with appropriate weights 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
the guidelines require all banks and bank holding companies to maintain a minimum ratio of total risk based capital to risk weighted assets of  including a minimum ratio of tier i capital to total risk weighted assets of and a tier i capital to average assets of leverage ratio 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory  and possibly additional discretionary  actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
as of december   the company and the bank are considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
under the capital adequacy guidelines  a well capitalized institution must maintain a minimum total risk based capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of at least  a minimum tier i capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of at least  and a minimum tier i leverage ratio of at least at december   the company s total risk based capital was  or of risk weighted assets  compared with  or of total risk weighted assets at december  at december   the company s tier i capital totaled  or of risk weighted assets  compared with  or of total risk weighted assets at december  the ratio of tier i capital to average weighted assets  or leverage ratio  at december  was  compared with at december  the following table sets forth the company s regulatory capital at december  and december   under the rules applicable at that date

contractual obligations the company is a party to certain contractual obligations under which it is obligated to make future payments 
these principally include borrowings from the fhlb  consisting of short and long term fixed rate borrowings  and collateralized by all stock in the fhlb  a blanket lien on qualified collateral consisting primarily of loans with first mortgages secured by one to four family properties  and certain pledged investment securities 
the company has an obligation to repay all borrowings from the fhlb 
the company is also obligated to make payments on an operating lease for its office at one cumberland place in bangor  maine

examples of such contractual agreements would include services providing atm  visa debit and credit card processing  trust services accounting support  student loan servicing  check printing  and the leasing of t telecommunication lines supporting the company s wide area technology network 
the majority of the company s core operating systems and software applications are maintained in house with traditional third party maintenance agreements of one year or less

off balance sheet arrangements include any transactions  agreements  or other contractual arrangements to which an entity unconsolidated with the company is a party  under which the company has i any obligation under certain guarantee contracts  ii a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets  iii any obligation under certain derivative instruments  iv any obligation under a material variable interest held by the company in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the registrant  or engages in leasing  hedging  or research and development services with the company 
at december  the company had the following off balance sheet arrangements standby letters of credit the bank guarantees the obligations or performance of certain customers by issuing standby letters of credit to third parties 
these letters of credit are sometimes issued in support of third party debt 
the risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as the credit risk involved in extending loan facilities to customers  and they are subject to the same origination  portfolio maintenance and management procedures in effect to monitor other credit products 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the bank upon issuance of a standby letter of credit  is based upon management s credit evaluation of the customer 
at december   commitments under existing standby letters of credit totaled  compared with  at december  the fair value of the standby letters of credit was not significant as of december  and other off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  the company did not have any other off balance sheet arrangements 
off balance sheet risk the bank is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and interest rate swap agreements 
commitments to extend credit commitments to extend credit represent agreements by the bank to lend to a customer provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements
