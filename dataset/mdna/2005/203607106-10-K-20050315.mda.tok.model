lastly  all references to peer banks pertain to a group of bank holding companies nationwide having billion to billion in assets and their associated composite financial results for the nine months ending september  the most recently available disclosure  as provided by the federal reserve board s division of banking supervision and regulation in the bank holding company performance report 
all share and share based amounts reflect the two for one stock split effected as a stock dividend on april  this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain forward looking statements with respect to the financial condition  results of operations and business of community bank system  inc these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties 
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements are set herein under the caption forward looking statements on page critical accounting policies as a result of the complex and dynamic nature of the company s business  management must exercise judgement in selecting and applying the most appropriate accounting policies for its various areas of operations 
the policy decision process not only ensures compliance with the latest generally accepted accounting principles  but also reflects on management s discretion with regard to choosing the most suitable methodology for reporting the company s financial performance 
it is management s opinion that the accounting estimates covering certain aspects of the business have more significance than others due to the relative importance of those areas to overall performance  or the level of subjectivity in the selection process 
these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that the critical accounting estimates include o allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses reflects management s best estimate of probable loan losses in the company s loan portfolio 
determination of the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective 
it requires significant estimates including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans and the amount of estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans which is based on historical loss experience and consideration of current economic trends  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
o actuarial assumptions associated with pension  post retirement and other employee benefit plans these assumptions include discount rate  rate of future compensation increases and expected return on plan assets 
table on page shows the impact of a one percentage point increase and decrease of each of these assumptions 
specific discussion of the assumptions used by management is discussed in note k on pages through o provision for income taxes the company is subject to examinations from various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the company to specific transactions 
management believes that the assumptions and judgements used to record tax related assets or liabilities have been appropriate 
should tax laws change or the taxing authorities determine that management s assumptions were inappropriate  an adjustment may be required which could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
o carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets is based upon discounted cash flow modeling techniques that require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
it also requires them to select a discount rate that reflects the current return requirements of the market in relation to present risk free interest rates  required equity market premiums and company specific risk indicators 
a summary of the accounting policies used by management is disclosed in note a summary of significant accounting policies starting on page executive summary the company s business philosophy is to operate as a community bank with local decision making  principally in non metropolitan markets  providing a broad array of banking and financial services to retail  commercial  and municipal customers 
the company s core operating objectives are i grow the branch network  primarily through a disciplined acquisition strategy  and certain selective de novo expansions  ii build high quality  profitable loan portfolios using both organic and acquisition strategies  iii increase the non interest income component of total revenues through development of banking related fee income  growth in existing financial services business units  and the acquisition of additional financial services and banking businesses  and iv utilize technology to deliver customer responsive products and services and to reduce operating costs 
significant factors management reviews to evaluate achievement of the company s operating objectives and its operating results and financial condition include  but are not limited to net income and earnings per share  return on assets and equity  net interest margins  non interest income  operating expenses  asset quality  loan and deposit growth  capital management  performance of individual banking and financial services business units  liquidity and interest rate sensitivity  enhancements to customer products and services  technology enhancements  market share  peer comparisons  and the performance of acquisition and integration activities 
in  the company reported record earnings as a result of acquired and organic growth in earning asset levels  strong growth in non interest income and improved asset quality  despite a lower net interest margin 
return on assets improved slightly over  to 
return on equity declined slightly to  due to strengthened capital levels 
non interest income  excluding a loss on early retirement of debt in  increased over with strong growth from banking sources  as well as from the company s employee benefits and wealth management businesses 
the company s efficiency ratio improved to for the year 
asset quality improved in  with reductions in delinquency  charge off and non performing loan ratios versus excluding acquisition activity  the company experienced loan growth in consumer mortgage and consumer direct and indirect lending  with declines in the business portfolio 
on a geographical basis  the new york markets reported strong growth in consumer mortgage and consumer direct and indirect loans  with slight declines in business lending 
excluding acquisitions  the pennsylvania markets reported declines in all portfolios 
excluding acquisition activity  total deposits declined slightly from the company completed two acquisitions in first heritage bank  a million asset commercial bank with three branches based in wilkes barre  pa  acquired in may  and a bank branch in dansville  ny  from hsbc bank usa  na  acquired in december with deposits of million 
net income and profitability net income for was million  up million or from the prior year 
earnings per share of in were higher than s results 
the growth rate of eps was below that of net income due to higher weighted average diluted shares outstanding 
the increase in diluted shares was primarily driven by the million and million shares of common stock issued in conjunction with the acquisition of first heritage in may and grange in november  an increased level of option grants and exercises  and a higher average common share price refer to the earnings per share section of note a on page for information regarding the impact of share price on diluted shares 
in addition to the earnings results presented above in accordance with gaap  the company provides cash earnings per share  which excludes the after tax effect of the amortization of intangible assets 
management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results 
cash earnings per share for were  up from for the year ended december  net income and earnings per share for were million and  up and  respectively  from results 
the results were impacted by million of debt restructuring charges associated with the early retirement of higher rate  medium term borrowings 
in contrast  earning per share benefited from net security and debt transaction gains of million 
in addition  banking services accounted for million of the improvement in  as overdraft volume and the related fees increased significantly in response to the implementation of the overdraft freedomtm program

the primary factors explaining performance are discussed in detail in the remaining sections of this document and are summarized as follows o as shown in table above  net interest income increased or million due to a million increase in average earning assets  partially offset by a basis point decrease in the net interest margin 
average loans grew million  primarily due to strong consumer mortgage growth as well as the impact of the acquisitions of first heritage in may and grange and peoples in average investments increased million in primarily as a result of a leveraging strategy that began in the third quarter of and ended during the second quarter of the growth in earning assets was funded by million more average deposits and million higher average borrowings 
o the loan loss provision of million decreased million  or  from the prior year level 
net charge offs of million decreased by million from  reducing the net charge off ratio net charge offs total average loans to for the year 
the improved asset quality position in was evident in standard metrics such as non performing loans as a percentage of total loans down seven basis points  non performing assets as a percentage of loans and other real estate owned down five basis points and delinquent loans days through non accruing as a percentage of total loans down basis points 
additional information on trends and policy related to asset quality is provided in the asset quality section on pages through o non interest income for of million increased by million from s level  the eleventh consecutive year of growth 
banking services accounted for million of the improvement  primarily due to the three whole bank acquisitions over the last months 
financial services revenue was million higher mostly as a result of the acquisition of harbridge at the end of july and strong growth at the company s retirement plan administration business  benefit plans administrative services 
gain loss on investment securities and debt prepayment transactions was  in as compared to a loss of million in the loss included million of debt restructuring charges associated with the early retirement of higher rate  medium term borrowings 
o total operating expenses rose million or in to million 
excluding acquisition expenses in both years  operating expenses rose million or 
a majority of the increase was due to increased personnel expenses associated with the acquisitions in late and  as well as merit increases  new hires  and higher costs in employee health and welfare programs 
in addition  higher legal and professional expenses were incurred with a substantial portion of the increase due to compliance with recently promulgated reporting requirements 
net occupancy expenses also increased because of a larger number of facilities due to acquisitions  current and prior year renovations  and slightly higher property tax and utility rates 
in addition  amortization of intangible assets increased million  or over due to the amortization of core deposit and customer relationship intangibles arising from the and acquisitions 
o the company s combined effective federal and state tax rate increased percentage points in to  primarily as a result of a higher proportion of income being generated from fully taxable loans and investments 
selected profitability and other measures return on average assets  return on average equity  dividend payout and equity to asset ratios for the years indicated are as follows table selected ratios return on average assets return on average equity dividend payout ratio average equity to average assets as displayed in table above  the return on average assets improved in in comparison to both and this was primarily a result of a greater proportion of earnings generated from non interest income and improved operational efficiencies 
reported return on equity in was down slightly from s level 
this was mainly a result of the build up of equity capital this year from the retention of net profits and the common shares issued in conjunction with the acquisitions of first heritage in may and grange in november consequently  average shareholders equity increased this year  as compared to a increase in reported net income 
for similar reasons average shareholder s equity increased in well above the increase in net income for the same period  resulting in a decrease in return on equity in as compared to the strengthening of the company s equity capital position over the past two years is reflected in the and basis point increases in the average equity to average total assets ratios in and  respectively 
net interest income net interest income is the amount that interest and fees on earning assets loans and investments exceeds the cost of funds  primarily interest paid to the company s depositors and interest on external borrowings 
net interest margin is the difference between the gross yield on earning assets and the cost of interest bearing funds as a percentage of earning assets 
as disclosed in table  net interest income with non taxable income converted to a fully tax equivalent basis totaled million in  up million or over the prior year 
a million increase in average earning assets more than offset a million increase in average interest bearing liabilities and a basis point decrease in the net interest margin 
as reflected in table  the volume changes mentioned above drove net interest income to rise million  while the lower net interest margin had a million negative impact on net interest income 
the net interest margin declined in each of the quarters of  from for the first quarter  ending with a margin for the fourth quarter 
this trend was mostly attributable to the level and changes in market interest rates during falling market rates early in the year allowed the company to reduce or hold steady rates on deposit interest bearing accounts in the first three quarters of the fourth quarter of saw interest rates on money market and time deposit accounts rise slightly in response to increasing market rates 
similarly  the yield on loans decreased throughout the first three quarters of the year 
the decline in loan yields had a greater negative impact on the margin in million than the benefit derived from deposit rate reductions million 
yields on investments declined basis points during from to as investment purchases were at lower rates 
lastly  the average interest rate paid on borrowings decreased basis points from for to for the net interest margin for increased seven basis points from in to 
falling market rates prevailed throughout the year 
however  the decline in total average earning asset yields of basis points was less than the benefit derived from a decline in the cost of funds of basis points  resulting in the increased net interest margin 
as shown in table  total interest income increased by million or in table shows that higher average earning assets contributed a positive million variance  partially offset by lower yields with a negative impact of million 
average loans grew a total of million in  the majority being the result of the million loans acquired in the first heritage acquisition in may of and the million of loans acquired in the peoples and grange acquisitions in late interest and fees on loans increased million or 
the increase was attributable to higher average loan balances positive million  partially offset by a basis point drop in loan yields negative million due to falling capital market rates 
average loans grew million in  with the vast majority coming from organic consumer mortgage and consumer indirect loan growth 
interest and fees on loans decreased million or in as compared to an basis point drop in loan yields due to falling interest rates had more of an impact negative million than growth in average loans positive million 
in early fourth quarter  management instituted an investment de leveraging strategy  allowing the portfolio to run down and using the proceeds to pay down borrowings due to the lack of investment opportunities offering acceptable yields 
this approach was in effect through june  when it was decided that investment purchases should be reinitiated to take advantage of more attractive medium and long term rates and a steep yield curve  as well as protect the company from its interest rate exposure to falling rates 
due to the de leveraging strategy being in place for approximately half of versus a leveraging strategy for most of  average investment balances for were up million versus the year earlier period  primarily in the us treasury and agency securities and obligations of state and political subdivision segments of the portfolio refer to the investments section of the md a on pages through for further information 
investment interest income in of million was million or higher than the prior year as a result of a larger portfolio positive million impact partially offset by a decrease in the average investment yield from to negative million impact 
the decrease in the yield was principally driven by significant declines in market interest rates from early through mid consequently  the company was unable to replace the run off of longer term  higher yielding securities with equivalent rate investments  and the purchase of securities in the relatively low interest rate environment in the second half of and led to yield declines 
however  the net spread on these medium term investment purchases were comparable because they were funded with a mixture of short to medium term low rate  borrowings 
in addition  the performance of the investment portfolio in was strong given the interest rate environment 
the company was able to maintain its yields to a great extent primarily because of two important strategies the addition of a substantial amount of call protected securities in and first half of when rates were higher  and foregoing security purchases in the late to mid period as rates were falling significantly 
the success of these actions was evident in the company s exceptional th percentile ranking within its peer group for tax equivalent investment yield for the nine months ended september investment interest income in of million was million or lower than the prior year as a result of the smaller portfolio negative million impact and a decrease in the average investment yield from to negative million impact 
the average earning asset yield fell basis points to in because of the previously mentioned decrease in investment and loan yields and the fact that the yields on the overall loan portfolio have converged with those of the investment portfolio 
in the yield on the loan portfolio was basis points higher than the yield on investments 
loan yields were only basis points above those produced by investments in and in the yield on the investment portfolio was basis points higher than the yield on the loan portfolio 
total average funding deposits and borrowings grew by million in  with million of the increase coming from deposits  mostly attributable to the acquisitions of first heritage  grange and peoples 
external borrowings were increased to fund organic loan growth and investment purchases over the last months resulting in average borrowings that were up million for as compared to the previous year 
the cost of funding was aided by the change in the make up of both the deposit base and external borrowings 
the fall of market interest rates over the last two years not only enabled a significant reduction of interest bearing deposit rates  but also caused many customers to shift their funds from time deposits to less restrictive accounts such as savings and demand deposits due to the greatly diminished rate spread between the two groups of accounts 
this is demonstrated by the percentage of average deposits that were in time deposit accounts dropping from in to in  accounting for a portion of the reduced funding costs beyond the absolute drop in rates 
the company also changed the proportion of short term funding in average external borrowings from in to in to take advantage of historically low short term rates  providing further funding cost savings 
total interest expense increased by million to million in as shown in table  higher levels of deposits and borrowings accounted for an million increase in interest expense  offset by an million decrease as a result of lower rates on deposits and external borrowings 
interest expense as a percentage of earning assets fell by basis points to 
the rate on interest bearing deposits fell basis points to  due largely to declines in time deposit rates for the first three quarters of the rate on external borrowings declined basis points to because of substantially lower market rates and the previously mentioned shift in funding mix towards short term borrowings 
total interest expense decreased by million to million in as compared to lower rates on deposits and external borrowings accounted for the majority of the decrease 
the rate on interest bearing deposits fell basis points to and the rate on external borrowings declined basis points to

non interest income the company s sources of non interest income are of three primary types general banking services related to loans  deposits and other core customer activities typically provided through the branch network  financial services  comprised of retirement plan administration and employee benefit trusts benefit plans administrative services or bpa  employee benefit actuarial and consulting services harbridge consulting group or harbridge  personal trust  investment and insurance products community investment services  inc or cisi and investment management elias asset management or eam  and periodic transactions  most often net gains losses from the sale of investments and prepayment of term debt

total non interest income for was up million or from s level  driven by significantly higher overdraft volume  the acquisition of harbridge and the growth at bpa 
these improvements were offset by substantially higher losses on the early retirement of long term borrowings  the absence of gains on the sale of securities and decreases in the other financial services group businesses 
non interest income as a percent of operating income fte basis was in  up percentage points from the prior year  an all time high for the company 
this increase was primarily driven by the aforementioned strong growth in overdraft fees and bpa revenue  as well as the acquisition of harbridge 
this ratio is considered an important measure for determining the progress the company is making on one of its primary long term strategies  expansion of non interest income in order to diversify its revenue sources and reduce reliance on net interest margins that may be strongly impacted by general interest rate and other market conditions 
the largest portion of the company s recurring non interest income is the wide variety of fees earned from general banking services  which reached million in  up from the prior year 
total banking services contributed of non interest income 
a large portion of the income growth was attributable to overdraft fees  up million over s level  due in large part to the incremental transaction volume generated from the accounts added through the first heritage  grange and peoples acquisitions 
in addition  commissions and other increased million  due to higher commissions and cash surrender values derived from life insurance policies acquired in the and acquisitions 
fees from the general banking services was million in  up million or from primarily driven by the success of the company s overdraft freedomtm program implemented in december as disclosed in table  non interest income from financial services rose million or in to million 
financial services revenue now comprises of total non interest income  excluding net gains losses on the sale of investment securities and retirement of debt 
this compares to in  with the increase primarily due to seven more months of revenue from harbridge  which was acquired at the end of july  resulting in million of incremental revenue for the financial services group in the current year 
another impressive year of revenue growth at bpa up million or was driven by a significant number of new plans under administration and growth in the market value of client assets 
these two businesses are part of the bpas subsidiary  and operate collaboratively to offer clients a full array of employee benefits  recordkeeping and consulting services throughout much of the country 
bpas revenue of million in was million higher than prior year results 
bpas revenue for was million  up million from primarily due to the acquisition of harbridge in july of as well as strong organic growth at bpa 
cisi and personal trust had positive growth of  and   respectively  as improving market conditions have positively impacted both businesses 
increased volume of annuity sales in response to higher interest rates and additional client relationships developed in the new markets opened up by the company s acquisitions has had a positive impact 
additionally  cisi has obtained a large number of higher net worth investors caused by recent retirees rolling over their k plans and or receiving inheritances 
in  cisi  elias and personal trust were all negatively impacted by the challenging retail investment market conditions of the past few years 
non interest income for was down million  million and million at cisi  elias and personal trust  respectively as compared to assets under management from the company s financial services businesses rose considerably over the last two years reaching billion at the end of  compared to billion at year end and billion at year end market driven gains in equity based assets were augmented by attraction of new client assets 
bpa in particular was very successful at growing its asset base  as demonstrated by the million or increase in its assets under administration 
the total financial services group contributed million excluding allocation of indirect corporate expense or of the company s pre tax income this year  reflecting nearly a margin 
in  financial services contribution was million or of total pre tax income  with a margin of 
the higher earnings were the result of new client business at bpa  cisi and personal trust as well as a full year of harbridge as compared to only five months in the increase in percentage contribution was primarily due to higher growth in the financial services businesses than the banking business s increase in net interest income and decline of the provision for loan losses 
there was a total net gain on security and debt transactions of  this year compared to a net loss of million in the loss in was primarily composed of million of charges associated with the early retirement of million of longer term fhlb borrowings that were replaced with lower rate  short term borrowings  which are expected to provide a long term earnings benefit as well as reduce interest rate risk 
the million net gain in included million of gains on million of investment sales  and a million prepayment penalty on the retirement of approximately million of intermediate term fhlb borrowings 
the security and debt gains and losses taken over the last three years are illustrative of the company s active management of its investment portfolio and external borrowings to achieve a desirable total return through the combination of net interest income  transaction gains losses and changes in market value across financial market cycles 
operating expenses as shown in table  operating expenses rose million or in to million 
excluding acquisition expenses  operating expenses were up million or in  reflective mostly of incremental operating expenses associated with the acquisitions of first heritage in and harbridge  grange and peoples in this year s operating expenses as a percent of average assets were  down from in and higher than the in the decrease in this ratio for was principally due to the acquisitions in late and the first half of grange and first heritage  whereby average assets increased significantly  while operating expenses only increased 
the increase in this ratio for was principally due to the acquisition of a financial services unit whose revenue is not driven by earning assets harbridge  and the charge offs resulting from higher overdraft volume  another significant revenue generating tool with a limited underlying asset base 
the efficiency ratio  a performance measurement tool widely used by banks  is defined by the company as operating expenses excluding acquisition expenses and intangible amortization divided by operating income fully tax equivalent net interest income plus non interest income  excluding net securities and debt gains and losses 
lower ratios correspond to higher efficiency 
in the efficiency ratio decreased percentage points to due in part to the investment leverage strategy in effect during the first half of the efficiency ratio for was percentage points higher than the ratio for this was primarily a result of net interest income being tempered for much of the year due to the investment de leveraging strategy  rising pension and medical expenses and the impact from reduced pre tax margins in the financial services businesses in  as discussed earlier 
table operating expenses years ended december  s omitted salaries and employee benefits    occupancy    equipment and furniture    legal and professional fees    data processing    amortization of intangible assets    office supplies    foreclosed property acquisition expenses  other    total operating expenses    operating expenses average assets efficiency ratio higher personnel expenses accounted for of s increase in operating costs  primarily the result of three acquisitions in and the first heritage acquisition in the remainder of the increases in personnel expense reflect higher benefit costs  merit increases and new hiring activity 
total full time equivalent staff at the end of was  compared to  at year end and  at year end medical expenses were up in due to a general rise in the cost of medical care  administration and insurance  as well as a greater number of insured employees 
qualified and non qualified pension expenses decreased slightly in principally due to a change in the company s defined benefit pension plan from a standard annuity paid benefit  to a cash balance design  offset by a reduction of the discount rate applied to future payments to from increases current expenses in present value terms and additional obligations for employees added through acquisition and organic growth 
the three assumptions that have the largest impact on the calculation of annual pension expense are the aforementioned discount rate  the rate applied to future compensation increases and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
table contains the results of a sensitivity analysis conducted to determine what the impact of a percentage point increase and decrease in these three assumptions would have on the annual pension expense for the two plans 
also  see note k to the financial statements for further information concerning the pension plan 
table pension plan sensitivity analysis one percentage point s omitted increase decrease discount rate rate of compensation increase expected return on plan assets total non personnel expenses increased million or in excluding acquisition related expenses  non personnel expenses were up million or from s level 
as displayed in table  this was largely caused by higher occupancy expense up 
million  equipment and furniture expense 
million  legal and professional fees million  data processing expense 
million  amortization of intangible assets million and other expenses million 
the increase in occupancy expense and equipment and furniture expense in was mainly due to incremental costs from recently acquired facilities  expenses arising from renovations and repairs  the effect of higher rates and severe weather on maintenance and utilities expenses and the general increase in property taxes in many of the locations we do business in 
the increase in legal and professional fees over the prior year was caused  in most part  by the additional responsibilities associated with complying with new governance and regulatory requirements 
data processing and other expenses were up primarily due to incremental recurring operating expense associated with the five acquisitions completed during the last eighteen months 
intangible amortization in was up versus the prior year due to the amortization of core deposit and customer relationship intangibles arising from the and acquisitions 
total non personnel expenses increased million or in as compared to  largely caused by higher occupancy expense up million  and other expenses up million and partially offset by lower intangible amortization down million 
the increase in occupancy expense in was mainly due to incremental costs from recently acquired facilities 
other expenses include two volume driven expense items that were up considerably due to record levels of business activity 
intangible amortization in was down versus the prior year because the drop in accelerated amortization of core deposit intangibles from the fleetboston branch acquisitions had a greater impact than the amortization of intangibles added as a result of the three acquisitions completed in acquisition expenses totaled million in  up from  in these expenditures were primarily comprised of severance and employee benefits of million  legal and consulting fees of  and system conversion costs of  and  of other general administrative expenses 
acquisition expenses totaled  in  down from  in these expenditures were primarily comprised of legal and consulting fees of   of system conversion costs and  of other general administrative expenses 
the majority of these expenses were incurred in conjunction with the company s largest acquisition of  grange national banc corp  in november income taxes the company estimates its tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe the respective tax authorities  plus the impact of deferred tax items 
taxes are discussed in more detail in note i of the consolidated financial statements on page accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the company s tax position 
if the final resolution of taxes payable differs from our estimates due to regulatory determination or legislative or judicial actions  adjustments to tax expense may be required 
the effective tax rate for increased by percentage points to 
this increase was primarily due to a larger proportion of income from fully taxable sources in  in comparison to the effective tax rate for of was down from the rate in this decline was primarily due to the benefits realized on a larger proportion of income from tax exempt investment securities in  versus capital shareholders equity ended at million  up million or from one year earlier 
this increase reflects million of common stock issued in conjunction with the acquisition of first heritage  net income of million and million from the issuance of shares through employee stock plans 
these increases were partially offset by common dividends declared of million  treasury share purchases of million and a million decline in the market value adjustment mva  represents the after tax  unrealized change in value of available for sale securities in the company s investment portfolio 
excluding accumulated other comprehensive income in both and  capital rose by million or 
shares outstanding rose by  during the year  comprised of  issued to first heritage shareholders and  added through employee stock plans  offset by the purchase of  treasury shares 
the company s ratio of tier i capital to assets or tier i leverage ratio  the basic measure for which regulators have established a minimum to be considered well capitalized  decreased basis points in to 
this was due to the net issuance of common stock and the capital building contribution from retained earnings net income less dividends declared offset by the proportionately higher organic and acquired growth of the investment and loan portfolios 
the tangible equity tangible assets ratio was at the end of versus one year earlier 
the company manages organic and acquired growth in a manner that enables it to continue to build upon its strong capital base  and maintain the company s ability to take advantage of future strategic growth opportunities 
cash dividends declared on common stock in of million represented an increase of over the prior year 
this growth was mostly a result of dividends per share of for increasing from in due to quarterly dividends per share being raised from to in the third quarter of and from to in the third quarter of the increase in dollar amount of dividends declared also reflects an increase in the number of shares outstanding at the end of this year  primarily a result of the million shares issued in may to first heritage shareholders

liquidity liquidity risk is measured by the company s ability to raise cash when needed at a reasonable cost and with a minimum of loss 
the company must be capable of meeting all obligations to its customers at any time and  therefore  the active management of its liquidity position is critical 
given the uncertain nature of our customers demands as well as the company s desire to take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities  the company must have available adequate sources of on and off balance sheet funds that can be acquired in time of need 
accordingly  in addition to the liquidity provided by balance sheet cashflows  liquidity must be supplemented with additional sources such as credit lines from correspondent banks  federal home loan bank  and federal reserve bank 
other funding alternatives may also be appropriate from time to time  including wholesale and retail repurchase agreements  large certificates of deposit  and brokered cd relationships 
the company s primary approach to measuring liquidity is known as the basic surplus deficit model 
it is used to calculate liquidity over two time periods first  the amount of cash that could be made available within days calculated as liquid assets less short term liabilities as a percentage of total assets  and second  a projection of subsequent cash availability over an additional days 
as of december   this ratio was and for the respective time periods  excluding the company s capacity to borrow additional funds from the federal home loan bank and other sources 
there is currently million in additional federal home loan bank borrowing capacity based on the company s year end collateral levels 
additionally  the company has million in unused capacity at the federal reserve bank and million in unused capacity from an unsecured line of credit with other correspondent banks 
in addition to the and day basic surplus deficit model  longer term liquidity over a minimum of five years is measured and a liquidity worksheet projecting sources and uses of funds is prepared 
to measure longer term liquidity  a baseline projection of loan and deposit growth for five years is made to reflect how liquidity levels could change over time 
this five year measure reflects ample liquidity for loan growth over the next five years 
though remote  the possibility of a funding crisis exists at all financial institutions and therefore must be planned for 
management has addressed this issue by formulating a liquidity contingency plan  which has been reviewed and approved by both the board of directors and the company s asset liability management committee 
the plan addresses those actions the company would take in response to both a short term and long term funding crisis 
a short term funding crisis would most likely result from a shock to the financial system  either internal or external  which disrupts orderly short term funding operations 
such a crisis should be temporary in nature and would not involve a change in credit ratings 
a long term funding crisis would most likely be the result of drastic credit deterioration at the company 
management believes that both circumstances have been fully addressed  backed up with detailed action plans and trigger points for monitoring such events 
intangible assets intangible assets at the end of of million were up million from the prior year end due to million of additional intangible assets arising from the acquisitions of first heritage bank and a branch located in dansville  as well as million of goodwill adjustments related primarily to fair value adjustments associated with the acquisitions  offset by million of amortization during the year 
intangible assets consist of goodwill  core deposit value and customer relationships arising from acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill at december  equaled million  comprised of million related to banking acquisitions and million arising from the acquisition of financial services businesses 
goodwill is subjected to an annual impairment analysis to determine whether the carrying value of the acquired net assets exceeds their fair value  which would necessitate a write down of the goodwill 
the company completed its goodwill impairment analyses during and and no adjustments were necessary 
the impairment analysis was based upon discounted cash flow modeling techniques that require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
it also requires them to select a discount rate that reflects the current return requirements of the market in relation to present risk free interest rates  required equity market premiums and company specific risk indicators 
management believes that there is a low probability of future impairment with regard to the goodwill associated with whole bank acquisitions 
the performance of elias asset management weakened subsequent to its acquisition in as a result of adverse market conditions  however  its performance stabilized in as market conditions improved 
additional declines in eam s operating results may result in impairment to its recorded goodwill of million 
core deposit intangibles represent the premium the company has paid for deposits acquired in excess of the cost incurred had the funds been purchased in the capital markets 
core deposit intangibles are amortized on either an accelerated or straight line basis over periods ranging from seven to twenty years 
the recognition of a customer relationship intangible arose due to the acquisition of harbridge 
this asset was determined based on a methodology that calculates the present value of the projected future revenue derived from the acquired customer base 
this asset is being amortized over eleven years on an accelerated basis

the acquisitions of first heritage and dansville accounted for million of that growth 
excluding the impact of these acquisitions at time of completion  total loans rose million or from the prior year 
all of the organic loan growth was produced in the consumer mortgage and installment lines of business  with declines experienced in business lending 
the organic loan growth was attributable to the new york market  with the pennsylvania market experiencing a net decline in loans outstanding 
the compounded annual growth rate cagr for the company s total loan portfolio between and was with approximately of the growth coming from whole bank and branch acquisitions and the balance from organic growth 
the greatest overall expansion occurred in the consumer mortgage segment  which grew at a cagr including the impact of acquisitions over that time frame 
the consumer mortgage growth was primarily driven by record mortgage refinancing volumes over the last three years  as well as the acquisition of consumer oriented banks in the intervening period 
the other loan categories grew at compounded annual growth rates of between and from to as a consequence  the consumer mortgages segment accounted for of the total loan portfolio at year end versus at the end of the weighting of retail lending in the company s loan portfolio enables it to be highly diversified 
approximately of loans outstanding at the end of were made to consumers borrowing on an installment and residential mortgage loan basis 
the commercial portfolio is also broadly diversified by industry type as demonstrated by the following distributions at year end real estate development  healthcare  general services  motor vehicle and parts dealers  construction  agriculture  restaurant lodging  retail trade  manufacturing and wholesale trade 
a variety of other industries with less than a share of the total portfolio comprise the remaining 
over the last year  the mix of loans has become more weighted towards business lending due to the high proportion of commercial loans in first heritage s portfolio 
the consumer mortgage segment of the company s loan portfolio is comprised of fixed and adjustable rate residential lending 
approximately million of the million growth in consumer mortgages was attributable to the acquisition of first heritage 
excluding the impact of this acquisition  this segment was up million or in due to continued strong mortgage volumes in the historically low interest rate environment 
all of the organic growth was generated in the new york market  as pennsylvania experienced a net decline in despite a significant volume of new originations 
the combined total of general purpose business lending  dealer floor plans  mortgages on commercial property  and farm loans is characterized as the company s business lending activity 
approximately million in business loans added through the first heritage acquisition offset the million decrease from ongoing operations in the majority of this decrease was attributable to the pennsylvania market  with the new york market experiencing a slight decrease 
lending efforts in first liberty s traditional markets continue to be challenged by a modest economic recovery  diminished capital spending levels in the commercial sector  an extremely competitive pricing environment and the company s dedication to maintaining strong credit quality standards 
management has worked aggressively to address the loan generation challenges in pennsylvania by adding enhanced management  lending and credit administration resources  and strong business relationships via the acquisition of first heritage in and grange in the enhanced scale and coverage of the pennsylvania business combined with the new management team s continued commitment to business development efforts  positions them to fully take advantage of growth opportunities in this key market as economic conditions continue to improve and increased capital spending leads to expanded borrowing activity in the commercial sector 
consumer installment loans  both those originated directly such as personal loans and home equity loans and lines of credit  and indirectly originated predominantly in automobile  marine and recreational vehicle dealerships  rose million from one year ago 
excluding acquisitions  consumer installment loans increased million year over year 
historically low interest rates  aggressive dealer and manufacturer incentives on new vehicles  and very competitive pricing on used vehicles have existed in these product types for more than a year 
consumer installment loans increased in the new york markets during the last months  while the pennsylvania markets decreased slightly

as shown in table above  non performing loans  defined as non accruing loans plus accruing loans days or more past due  ended at million  down approximately million or from one year earlier despite a million increase in loans outstanding 
the ratio of non performing loans to total loans declined seven basis points from twelve months earlier to 
the ratio of non performing assets which includes troubled debt restructuring and other real estate  or oreo  in addition to non performing loans to total loans plus oreo decreased to at year end  down five basis points from one year earlier 
the improvement in both ratios was driven by improvements in the economy  enhanced collection and recovery efforts  and the charge off and disposition of certain problematic loans over the last two years 
had nonaccrual loans as of december  been current in accordance with their original terms  additional interest income of approximately million would have been recorded

these measures were  and  respectively  as of december  delinquency levels  particularly in the to days category  tend to be somewhat volatile due to their measurement at a point in time  and therefore management believes that it is useful to look at this ratio over a longer period 
the total average delinquency ratio for was versus in the changes in the allowance for loan losses for the last five years is as follows table allowance for loan loss activity years ended december  s omitted amount of loans outstanding at end of period      daily average amount of loans net of unearned discount      allowance for loan losses at beginning of period      charge offs business lending      consumer mortgage consumer direct and indirect      total charge offs      recoveries business lending consumer mortgage consumer direct and indirect      total recoveries      net charge offs      provision for loan losses      allowance on acquired loans    allowance for loan losses at end of period      net charge offs to average loans outstanding this reserve addition is attributable to loans purchased from first heritage bank in  peoples bankcorp inc and grange national banc corp in and citizens national bank of malone and fleetboston financial corporation in as displayed in table above  total net charge offs in were million  down million from the prior year  principally due to significantly improved results in the business lending portfolio 
net charge offs in were million above s level  and were impacted by the increased size of the average loan portfolio  resulting from both organic and acquired loan growth in in addition  a prolonged period of economic weakness from late through early impacted the net charge off levels in both and  with the greatest impact being realized in the business loan segment 
due to the significant increase in average loan balances in and as a result of the factors mentioned above  management believes that net charge offs as a percent of average loans net charge off ratio offers a clearer representation of asset quality trends 
the net charge off ratio for was down basis points from last year to 
this year s ratio benefited from improved recovery performance  as evidenced by the million increase in recoveries to million  representing of average gross charge offs for the latest two years  compared to in business loan net charge offs decreased in  totaling million or of average business loans outstanding versus million and in the primary reason for the decreased net charge off ratio for business loans was generally improved economic conditions in the markets served by the company  as well as the charge off of a number of business loans in that had been identified as weak and had been specifically reserved for in previous periods 
consumer direct and indirect loan net charge offs increased slightly to million this year from million in  but the net charge off ratio dropped slightly from in to in due to larger average balances 
consumer mortgage net charge offs rose million to due to the much larger size of the portfolio 
the net charge off ratio of was higher than the prior year  but remains low 
all the primary asset quality metrics deteriorated in and continued into  in comparison to the to period 
this was principally due to the weakened economic conditions in the company s markets  and was manifested most strongly in the business loan portfolio 
based on almost all measurements  the asset quality profile of the company began to improve in in conjunction with gradually improving economic conditions and strengthened credit administration and loan review resources 
significant changes and enhancements were made to lending and credit administration functions in and through  and these improvements had a significantly positive impact on credit management performance in management continually evaluates the credit quality of the company s loan portfolio and conducts a formal review of the allowance for loan loss adequacy on a quarterly basis 
the two primary components of the loan review process that are used to determine proper allowance levels are specific and general loan loss allocations 
measurement of specific loan loss allocations is typically based on expected future cash flows  collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrower s ability to pay 
impaired loans greater than  are evaluated for specific loan loss allocations  as defined in sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended 
consumer mortgages and consumer direct and indirect loans are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively 
the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent days or more 
the second component of the allowance establishment process  general loan loss allocations  is composed of two calculations that are computed on the four main loan segments commercial  consumer direct  consumer indirect and residential real estate 
the first calculation determines an allowance level based on the latest three years of historical net charge off data for each loan category commercial loans exclude balances with special loan loss allocations 
the second calculation is qualitative and takes into consideration five major factors affecting the level of loan loss risk portfolio risk migration patterns internal credit quality trends  the growth of the segments of the loan portfolio  economic and business environment trends in the company s markets includes review of bankruptcy  unemployment  population  consumer spending and regulatory trends  industry  geographical and product concentrations in the portfolio  and the perceived effectiveness of managerial resources and lending practices and policies 
these two allowance calculations are added together to determine the general loan loss allocation 
the allowance levels computed from the specific and general loan loss allocation methods are combined to derive the necessary allowance for loan loss to be reflected on the consolidated statement of condition 
the loan loss provision is calculated by subtracting the previous period allowance for loan loss  net of the interim period net charge offs  from the current required allowance level 
this provision is then recorded as an expense in the income statement for that period 
members of senior management and the loan committee of the board of directors review the adequacy of the allowance for loan loss quarterly 
management is committed to continually improving the credit assessment and risk management capabilities of the company and will dedicate the resources necessary to ensure advancement in this critical area of operations 
the allowance for loan loss was increased to million at year end from million at the end of the million increase was primarily due to million more in loans outstanding  offset by an overall improvement in the company s asset quality profile 
the ratio of the allowance for loan loss to total loans decreased to for year end versus at the end of last year 
management believes the year end allowance for loan losses to be adequate in light of the probable losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
the loan loss provision decreased by million or in as a result of management s assessment of the probable losses in the loan portfolio  and the reduced level of charge offs in  as discussed above 
the loan loss provision as a percentage of average loans decreased from in to this year in most part due to the provision last year being elevated to cover higher risk levels in the business loan segment of the portfolio 
the loan loss provision covered net charge offs by this year versus in  reflective of the improvements in asset quality trends during the year 
the net charge off ratio in was more consistent with the ratios of the to period  as shown in table above 
as previously noted  there was a strong correlation between the increased level of net charge offs in and and the performance of the overall economy 
the company s net charge off ratio was also above basis points during the to period  when the ratio fluctuated between and basis points 
not surprisingly  similar to the period from mid through late  that time frame included a recession and the first stage of an economic recovery 
the net charge off ratio dropped significantly in the years immediately following that period 
in  the company realized the benefits of one of management s primary goals  which was to steadily bring the net charge off ratio back to a range that was consistent with historical performance 
the following table shows management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type as of december table allowance for loan losses by loan type loan loan loan loan loan s omitted allowance mix allowance mix allowance mix allowance mix allowance mix consumer mortgage    business lending      consumer direct and indirect      unallocated   total      as demonstrated in table above and discussed previously  the risk inherit in the consumer mortgage portfolio is much lower than that of the other segments of the loan portfolio 
the risk differential is illustrated by the average net charge off ratio of over the last three years for consumer mortgages compared to the average for the rest of the portfolio over the same time frame 
this is manifested in the comparatively small million allowance attributable to consumer mortgages  representing only of the their ending balance versus for the remaining portion of the loan portfolio 
the increase in the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses over related principally to the portfolio and reserves acquired as part of the first heritage acquisition 
as that acquired portfolio is further subjected to the company s established risk rating and review procedures  it is expected that some portion of the unallocated reserve will be allocated to the specific product categories 
funding sources the company utilizes a variety of funding sources to support the earning asset base as well as to achieve targeted growth objectives 
overall funding is comprised of three primary sources that possess a variety of maturity  stability  and price characteristics deposits of individuals  partnerships and corporations ipc deposits  collateralized municipal deposits public funds  and external borrowings 
the average daily amount of deposits and the average rate paid on each of the following deposit categories are summarized below for the years indicated table average deposits average average average average average average s omitted  except rates balance rate paid balance rate paid balance rate paid noninterest bearing demand deposits    interest bearing demand deposits    regular savings deposits    money market deposits    time deposits    total deposits    as displayed in table above  total average deposits for equaled billion  up million or from the prior year 
this increase was principally the result of deposits obtained through the first heritage acquisition in and the grange and peoples acquisitions in late the dansville branch acquisition did not have a significant impact on full year average deposit levels because it was completed late in the year 
average deposits in were up million or from the acquisitions of peoples and grange did not have a significant impact on full year average deposit levels because they were completed relatively late in the year 
the company s funding composition continues to benefit from a high level of ipc deposits  which reached an all time high in with an average balance of billion  an increase of million or over the comparable period 
this was largely due to the million and million in ipc deposits added in conjunction with the acquisition of first heritage in may and grange in late  respectively 
ipc deposits are frequently considered to be a bank s most attractive source of funding because they are generally stable  do not need to be collateralized  have a relatively low cost  and provide a strong customer base for which a variety of loan  deposit and other financial service related products can be sold 
full year average deposits of local municipalities increased million or during  million as a result of the grange  first heritage and dansville acquisitions 
the company is required to collateralize all local government deposits with marketable securities from its investment portfolio 
because of this stipulation  management considers this source of funding to be equivalent to external borrowings 
as such  the company generally prices these deposits consistent with alternative external borrowing rates 
the mix of average deposits in changed slightly in comparison to the weightings of demand deposit and savings account balances all increased from their levels  while interest checking  money market and time deposit weightings decreased 
this change in mix largely reflects less willingness by certain customers to being locked into lower cd rates and accounts with higher minimum balance requirements interest checking and money market given the market driven contraction of interest rate spreads between these accounts and the ones with less restrictions on withdrawels  such as demand deposits and savings 
this shift in the deposit mix resulted in a greater drop in the overall cost of funds on deposits than would have been achieved through the reduction of interest rates alone 
as a result of market interest rates remaining at historically low levels for an extended period of time  spreads between these groups of accounts have stabilized and customers appear to be more willing to hold term deposits given the lack of viable alternatives with similar risk return characteristics 
this factor combined with the company s ongoing commitment to continually expand its advantageous ipc deposit base to fund earning asset growth  prompted the development of a new money market product in the fourth quarter of that has been an effective tool for attracting new customer funds 
the remaining maturities of time deposits in amounts of  or more outstanding as of december are as follows table time deposit  maturities s omitted less than three months   three months to six months   six months to one year   over one year   total   external borrowings are defined as funding sources available on a national market basis  generally requiring some form of collateralization 
borrowing sources for the company include the federal home loan bank of new york and federal reserve bank of new york  as well as access to the national repurchase agreement market through established relationships with primary market security dealers 
the company also had approximately million in fixed and floating rate subordinated debt outstanding at the end of that is held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts 
external borrowings averaged million or of total funding sources for all of as compared to million or of total funding sources for as shown in table below  at year end  million or of external borrowings had remaining terms of one year or less  up considerably from million and at the end of this change in external funding mix is due to an increase in short and medium term borrowings to take advantage of historically low short term rates  as well as  to reduce the company s sensitivity to falling interest rates and to provide more flexibility with regard to altering future debt levels 
during fourth quarter  million in longer term federal home loan bank borrowings were retired early and replaced with significantly lower rate  short term debt  resulting in an earnings charge of million 
this strategy was implemented because the projected cost of the replacement debt  including prepayment charges  was favorable on a long term  economic basis in comparison to holding the existing borrowings 
as displayed in table on page  the overall mix of funding has shifted in the percentage of funding derived from deposits decreased to in from in and short and medium term fhlb borrowings increased during the year principally to fund security purchases 
these borrowings carry relatively short maturities and help provide funding cost stability for a period of time that is complementary to our asset liability profile

these financial instruments consist primarily of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers  generally having fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may require payment of a fee 
these commitments consist principally of unused commercial and consumer credit lines 
standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of an underlying contract with a third party 
the credit risks associated with commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are essentially the same as that involved with extending loans to customers and are subject to normal credit policies 
collateral may be obtained based on management s assessment of the customer s creditworthiness 
the fair value of these commitments is immaterial for disclosure in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the contract amount of these off balance sheet financial instruments as of december is as follows table off balance sheet financial instruments s omitted commitments to extend credit   standby letters of credit   total   investments the objective of the company s investment portfolio is to hold low risk  high quality earning assets that provide favorable returns and are another effective tool to actively manage its asset liability position to maximize future net interest income operation 
this must be accomplished within the following constraints a implementing certain interest rate risk management strategies which achieve a relatively stable level of net interest income  b providing both the regulatory and operational liquidity necessary to conduct day to day business activities  c considering investment risk weights as determined by the regulatory risk based capital guidelines  and d generating a favorable return without undue compromise of the other requirements 
as displayed in table below  the book value of the company s investment portfolio increased million or during the year to billion as a result of the first heritage acquisition and the leveraging strategy that began in the third quarter of and ended during the second quarter of average investment balances book value basis for were up million or versus the prior year 
investment interest income in was million or higher than the prior year as a result of the increased average balances in the portfolio  offset by the decrease in the average investment yield from to 
the decline in the yield was primarily due to the maturity of securities from the portfolio that had been issued in the higher interest rate environments of previous periods and were replaced with investments that carry comparatively lower yields 
this was expected given the fact that longer term market interest rates  despite modest increases in the third quarter of and all of  were still at historically low levels 
however  the impact of lower investment yields was mostly offset by the funding of the purchases with very low rate medium and short term borrowings  resulting in similar net spreads 
in order to protect the company against its exposure to falling interest rates  the vast majority of the investment purchases in and were in intermediate term us agency securities with average call protection in excess of six years 
investments sales  excluding federal home loan bank  in the current year totaled million and were all related to securities inherited from acquired companies  and resulted in an immaterial amount of net gains 
the sales were based on the company s total return strategy see below or to remove securities that no longer adhere to investment policy guidelines 
those proceeds that were reinvested resulted in an improved interest rate risk position 
as of december  the investment portfolio had a weighted average life of years as compared to as of december  the investment portfolio has limited credit risk due to the composition continuing to heavily favor us agency debentures  us agency mortgage backed pass throughs  us agency cmos and municipal bonds insured by third parties 
as of year end  these four aaa rated highest possible rating security types accounted for of the portfolio s total book value  excluding federal home loan bank stock and federal reserve bank stock  or   and respectively 
these four security types comprised of total investments as of december  at   and  respectively 
the change in the investment mix reflects management s strategy over the last several years of primarily purchasing medium term  call protected us agency and municipal bonds that offer both attractive yields and are free from short term reinvestment risk 
mbs and cmo securities typically possess a high level of this latter risk  particularly in periods with high levels of mortgage refinancing such as have existed over the last few years in the extremely low interest rate environment 
as a consequence  the company has avoided investing in these types of securities during this period  and this fact combined with high run off rates explains the significant drop in their weighting in the total investment portfolio 
the company has utilized total return as its primary methodology for managing investment portfolio assets 
under this analytical method  shareholder value is maximized through both interest income and market value appreciation 
the commitment to this approach is reflected in the fact that no security sales were conducted in outside of minor transactions associated with the investments of acquired banks  despite the significant level of market gains in the portfolio see mva discussion in the following paragraph 
management chose not to take gains in the current year to increase short term earnings at the expense of profitability in future periods 
ninety one percent of the investment portfolio was classified as available for sale at year end versus eighty nine percent at the end of the net pre tax market value gain over book value for the available for sale portfolio as of december  was million  million lower than it was one year earlier

impact of inflation and changing prices the company s financial statements have been prepared in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
notwithstanding this  inflation can directly affect the value of loan collateral  in particular real estate

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates  prices or credit risk 
credit risk associated with the company s loan portfolio has been previously discussed in the asset quality section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
although more than a third of the securities portfolio at year end was invested in municipal bonds  management believes that the tax risk of the company s municipal investments associated with potential future changes in statutory  judicial and regulatory actions is minimal 
the company also believes that it has an insignificant amount of credit risk in its investment portfolio because essentially all of the fixed income securities in the portfolio are aaa rated highest possible rating 
the company does not have any material foreign currency exchange rate risk exposure 
therefore  almost all the market risk in the investment portfolio is related to interest rates 
the ongoing monitoring and management of both interest rate risk and liquidity  in the short and long term time horizons is an important component of the company s asset liability management process  which is governed by limits established in the policies reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the policies to the asset liability committee alco  which meets each month 
the committee is made up of the company s senior management as well as regional and line of business managers who oversee specific earning asset classes and various funding sources 
asset liability management the primary objective of the company s asset liability management process is to maximize earnings and return on capital within acceptable levels of risk 
as the company does not believe it is possible to reliably predict future interest rate movements  it has maintained an appropriate process and set of measurement tools that enable it to identify and quantify sources of interest rate risk in varying rate environments 
the primary tools used by the company in managing interest rate risk are the income simulation model and economic value of equity modeling 
interest rate risk interest rate risk irr can result from the timing differences in the maturity repricing of an institution s assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts  the effect of embedded options  such as loan prepayments  interest rate caps  and deposit withdrawals  and differences in the behavior of lending and funding rates  sometimes referred to as basis risk  an example of basis risk would occur if floating rate assets and liabilities  with otherwise identical repricing characteristics  were based on market indexes that were imperfectly correlated 
given the potential types and differing related characteristics of irr  it is important that the company maintain an appropriate process and set of measurement tools that enable it to identify and quantify its primary sources of irr 
the company also recognizes that effective management of irr includes an understanding of when potential adverse changes in interest rates will flow through the income statement 
accordingly  the company will manage its position so that it monitors its exposure to net interest income over both a one year planning horizon and a longer term strategic horizon 
it is the company s objective to manage its exposure to interest rate risk  bearing in mind that it will always be in the business of taking on rate risk and that rate risk immunization is not possible 
also  it is recognized that as exposure to interest rate risk is reduced  so too may net interest margin be reduced 
income simulation income simulation is tested on a wide variety of balance sheet and treasury yield curve scenarios 
the simulation projects changes in net interest income caused by the effect of changes in interest rates 
the model requires management to make assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time in different interest rate environments 
loan and deposit growth rate assumptions are derived from management s outlook  as are the assumptions used for new loan yields and deposit rates 
loan prepayment speeds are based on a combination of current industry averages and internal historical prepayments 
balance sheet and yield curve assumptions are analyzed and reviewed by the alco committee regularly 
the following table reflects the company s one year net interest income sensitivity  using december  asset and liability levels as a starting point 
the prime rate and federal funds rates are assumed to move up basis points and down basis points over a month period while flattening the long end of the treasury curve to spreads over federal funds that are more consistent with historical norms 
deposit rates are assumed to move in a manner that reflects the historical relationship between deposit rate movement and changes in the federal funds rate  generally reflecting of the movement of the federal funds rate 
cash flows are based on contractual maturity  optionality and amortization schedules along with applicable prepayments derived from internal historical data and external sources 
net interest income sensitivity model calculated increase decrease in projected net interest income at december changes in interest rates basis points   basis points   in the model  both the rising and falling rate environments reflect a reduction in net interest income nii from a flat rate environment due to the assumed flattening of the yield curve 
the modeled nii in a falling rate environment is initially more favorable than if rates were to rise due to a faster initial reaction from core deposit pricing and short term capital market borrowing rates 
over a longer time period  however  the growth in nii improves significantly in a rising rate environment as a result of lower yielding earning assets running off and being replaced at increased rates 
the analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and other factors 
while the assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above 
those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on and off balance sheet financial instruments 
such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and shifts in the maturity curve of interest rates and provide management with a long term interest rate risk metric
