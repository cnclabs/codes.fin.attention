expand our international operations 
our international sales  the majority of which are in canada  accounted for approximately of total sales in we believe that there is significant additional demand for our products and services outside the united states and canada 
many of our multinational domestic customers are seeking distribution  integrated supply and project management solutions globally

we also have operations in nigeria to serve west africa  an office in singapore to support our operations in asia and an office in united arab emirates to serve the middle east 
competitive strengths we believe the following strengths are central to the successful execution of our strategy market leadership 
our ability to manage large construction projects and complex multi site plant maintenance programs and procurement projects that require special sourcing  technical advice  logistical support and locally based service has enabled us to establish leadership positions in our principal markets 
we have utilized these skills to generate significant revenues in industries with intensive use of electrical and mro products  including electrical contracting  utilities  oem  process manufacturing and other commercial  institutional and governmental entities 
we also have extended our position within these industries to expand our customer base 
value added services 
we are a leader in providing a wide range of services and procurement solutions that draw on our product knowledge  supply and logistics expertise and systems capabilities  enabling our customers with large operations and multiple locations to reduce supply chain costs and improve efficiency 
our expansive geographical coverage is essential to our ability to provide these services  as our approximately branches complement national sales and marketing activities with local customer service  product information and technical support  order fulfillment and a variety of other on site services 
these programs include national accounts we coordinate product supply and materials management activities for mro supplies  project needs and direct material for national and regional customers with multiple locations who seek purchasing leverage through a single electrical products provider 
regional and national contractors  and top engineering and construction firms which specialize in major projects such as airport expansions  power plants and oil and gas facilities are also a focus group for our national accounts program  integrated supply we design and implement programs that enable our customers to significantly reduce the number of mro suppliers they use through services that include highly automated  proprietary electronic procurement and inventory replenishment systems and on site materials management and logistics services

we have an operation in nigeria to serve west africa  an office in united arab emirates to serve the middle east and an office in singapore to support our sales to asia 
all of the international locations have been established to primarily serve our growing list of customers with global operations referenced under national accounts above 
the following table sets forth information about us by geographic area net sales long lived assets year ended december  december  in thousands united states foreign operations canada other foreign subtotal foreign operations total us and foreign management information systems wesco has implemented data processing systems to provide support for a full range of business functions  such as customer service  inventory and logistics management  accounting and administrative support 
our primary branch information system  known as wesnet  has become the fundamental data processing vehicle for all branch operations other than our bruckner integrated supply division and certain acquired branches 
the wesnet system provides all of the basic day to day order management and order fulfillment functions 
the wesnet application and server reside locally within each branch and provide wesco with a flexible and cost effective approach to facilitate expansion and organizational growth 
the distributed systems plug in to a centralized data processing center via a wide area network that provides a tightly coupled  yet flexible system 
the centralized corporate information system and data warehouse provide a platform whose capability exceeds many of the most advanced enterprise resource planning packages 
wesco s centralized servers contain real time transactional data from each branch system  as well as multiple years of historical transaction data 
the centralized server and data warehouse technology provide a cost effective mechanism to better monitor  manage and enhance operational processes 
these systems have become the principal technology supporting inventory management  purchasing management  automated stock replenishment  margin analysis and both financial and operational insight 
the data warehouse is also utilized to perform extensive operational analysis and provide detailed insight for all major business processes 
by leveraging this technology  all level of employees have the ability to analyze their area of responsibility and drive improvements through the organization 
the system contains a variety of analytic tools  including activity based costing capability for analyzing profitability by customer  sales representative  product type and shipment type 
many other tools permit analysis of sales and margins  supplier sales planning  item analysis  market analysis  product insight and many other operational reporting and trending applications 
the centralized platform also facilitates the processing of customer orders  shipping notices  suppliers purchase orders and funds transfer via edi 
wesco has a legacy of supporting standard edi with many trading partners 
over the years we have added capability to support several other integration vehicles beyond standard edi to better support our customers needs 
the evolving integration capability allows us to seamlessly connect our information systems platform with those of our customer s and suppliers 
our integrated supply services are supported by our proprietary procurement and inventory management systems 
these systems provide a fully integrated  flexible supply chain platform that currently handles over of our integrated supply customers transactions electronically 
our configuration options for a customer range from on line linkages to the customer s business and purchasing systems  to total replacement of a customer s procurement and inventory management system for mro supplies 

table of contents competition we believe that we are the second largest distributor in the estimated billion us electrical distribution industry  and the largest provider of integrated supply services for mro goods and services in the united states 
we operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry 
we compete directly with national  regional and local providers of electrical and other industrial mro supplies 
in  the latest year for which market share data is available  the four national distributors  including wesco  accounted for approximately of estimated total industry sales 
competition is primarily focused on the local service area  and is generally based on product line breadth  product availability  service capabilities and price 
another source of competition is buying groups formed by smaller distributors to increase purchasing power and provide some cooperative marketing capability 
while increased buying power may improve the competitive position of buying groups locally  we believe these groups have not been able to compete effectively with us for national account customers due to the difficulty in coordinating a diverse ownership group 
although certain internet based procurement service companies  auction businesses and trade exchanges remain in the marketplace  the impact on our business from these potential competitors has been minimal to date 
employees as of december   we had approximately  employees worldwide  of which approximately  were located in the united states and approximately in canada and our other international locations 
less than of our employees are represented by unions 
we believe our labor relations are generally good 
intellectual property we currently have trademarks and service marks registered with the us patent and trademark office 
the registered trademarks and service marks include wesco  wesco s corporate logo  the running man logo  the running man in box logo  and the extra effort people 
these and other trademarks and service mark registration applications have been filed in various foreign jurisdictions  including canada  mexico  the united kingdom  singapore  and the european community 
environmental matters our facilities and operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety 
some of these laws and regulations may impose strict  joint and several liability on certain persons for the cost of investigation or remediation of contaminated properties 
these persons may include former  current or future owners or operators of properties  and persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances 
our owned and leased real property may give rise to such investigation  remediation and monitoring liabilities under environmental laws 
in addition  anyone disposing of certain products we distribute  such as ballasts  fluorescent lighting and batteries  must comply with environmental laws that regulate certain materials in these products 
we believe that we are in compliance  in all material respects  with applicable environmental laws 
as a result  we will not make significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the current year or in the near future 
seasonality our operating results are affected by certain seasonal factors 
sales are typically at their lowest during the first quarter due to a reduced level of activity during the winter months 
sales increase during the warmer months beginning in march and continuing through november 
sales drop again slightly in december as the weather cools and also as a result of a reduced level of activity during the holiday season 
as a result  we report sales and earnings in the first quarter that are generally lower than that of the remaining quarters

risk factors important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements we make are described below 
all forward looking statements attributable to us or persons working on our behalf are expressly qualified by the following cautionary statements our substantial amount of debt requires substantial debt service obligations that could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and could limit our growth and impose restrictions on our business 
we are significantly leveraged 
as of december   we had million of consolidated indebtedness  including million in principal amount of senior subordinated notes due in  and stockholders equity of million 
on march   we redeemed approximately million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes 
we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future  subject to certain limitations contained in the instruments governing our indebtedness 
accordingly  we will have significant debt service obligations 
these amounts exclude our accounts receivable securitization program  through which we sell up to million of our accounts receivable to a third party conduit and remove these receivables from our consolidated balance sheet 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates 
our debt service obligations have important consequences  including but not limited to the following a substantial portion of cash flow from our operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available for operations  future business opportunities and acquisitions and other purposes  and increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions  our ability to obtain additional financing in the future may be limited  
table of contents as a result of our interest rate swap agreements  approximately million of our fixed rate indebtedness has been effectively converted to variable rates of interest  which will make us vulnerable to increases in interest rates  we are substantially more leveraged than certain of our competitors  which might place us at a competitive disadvantage  and we may be hindered in our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions 
our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of  to pay interest on  or to refinance our indebtedness and to make scheduled payments under our operating leases or to fund planned capital expenditures or finance acquisitions will depend on our future performance  which to a certain extent is subject to economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt  make necessary capital expenditures or meet other cash needs 
if unable to do so  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt  to sell assets or to obtain additional financing 
a million portion of the purchase commitments under our receivables facility requires an annual renewal of its terms 
that portion of the arrangement expires on august  the remaining million portion of the purchase commitments under the facility has a three year term expiring on august  there can be no assurance that available funding or that any sale of assets or additional financing would be possible in amounts on terms favorable to us 
over the next three years  we are obligated to pay approximately million relating to earnout agreements associated with past acquisitions  of which million is represented by a note payable which is included in our consolidated indebtedness as of december  another acquisition agreement also contains contingent consideration provision of up to million 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
restrictive debt covenants contained in our revolving credit facility and the indenture to our senior subordinated notes may limit our ability to take certain actions 
the revolving credit facility and the indenture under which our senior subordinated notes were issued contain financial and operating covenants that limit the discretion of our management  under certain circumstances  with respect to certain business matters including incurring additional indebtedness and paying dividends 
the revolving credit facility also requires us to meet certain fixed charge tests depending on credit line availability 
our ability to comply with these and other provisions of the revolving credit facility and the indenture may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control 
a failure to comply with the obligations contained in the revolving credit facility or the indenture could result in an event of default under either the revolving credit facility or the indenture which could result in acceleration of the related debt and the acceleration of debt under other instruments evidencing indebtedness that may contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
if the indebtedness under the revolving credit facility were to be accelerated  there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full such indebtedness and our other indebtedness 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
downturns in the electrical distribution industry have had in the past  and may in the future have  an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
the electrical distribution industry is affected by changes in economic conditions  including national  regional and local slowdowns in construction and industrial activity  which are outside our control 
our operating results may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates that may lead to a decline in economic activity  particularly in the construction market  while simultaneously resulting in higher interest payments under the revolving credit facility and interest rate swap agreements 
in addition  during periods of economic slowdown such as the one we recently experienced  our credit losses  based on history  could increase 
there can be no assurance that economic slowdowns  adverse economic conditions or cyclical trends in certain customer markets will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents an increase in competition could decrease sales or earnings 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
we compete directly with national  regional and local providers of electrical and other industrial mro supplies 
competition is primarily focused in the local service area and is generally based on product line breadth  product availability  service capabilities and price 
other sources of competition are buying groups formed by smaller distributors to increase purchasing power and provide some cooperative marketing capability 
some of our existing competitors have  and new market entrants may have  greater financial and marketing resources than us 
to the extent existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices  we may be required to lower our prices  thereby adversely affecting financial results 
existing or future competitors also may seek to compete with us for acquisitions  which could have the effect of increasing the price and reducing the number of suitable acquisitions 
in addition  it is possible that competitive pressures resulting from the industry trend toward consolidation could affect growth and profit margins 
loss of key suppliers or lack of product availability could decrease sales and earnings 
most of our agreements with suppliers are terminable by either party on days notice or less 
our ten largest suppliers in accounted for approximately of our purchases for the period 
our largest supplier in was eaton corporation  through its eaton electrical division  accounting for approximately of our purchases 
the loss of  or a substantial decrease in the availability of  products from any of these suppliers  or the loss of key preferred supplier agreements  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
supply interruptions could arise from shortages of raw materials  labor disputes or weather conditions affecting products or shipments  transportation disruptions  or other reasons beyond our control 
in addition  certain of our products  such as wire and conduit  are commodity price based products and may be subject to significant price fluctuations which are beyond our control 
an interruption of operations at any of our five distribution centers could have a material adverse effect on the operations of branches served by the affected distribution center 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that particular products or product lines will be available to us  or available in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand 
such limited product access could cause us to be at a competitive disadvantage 
a disruption of our information systems could increase expenses  decrease sales or reduce earnings 
a serious disruption of our information systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our computer systems are an integral part of our business and growth strategies 
we depend on our information systems to process orders  manage inventory and accounts receivable collections  purchase products  ship products to our customers on a timely basis  maintain cost effective operations and provide superior service to our customers 
we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny and may sustain a loss of public confidence if we are unable to satisfy regulatory requirements relating to internal controls over financial reporting 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to perform an evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting and have our auditor attest to such evaluation on an annual basis 
compliance with these requirements has been expensive and time consuming  and we expect that to continue 
while we believe that we will be able to continue to meet the required deadlines  no assurance can be given that we will meet the required deadlines in future years 
if we fail to timely complete this evaluation  or if our auditors cannot timely attest to our evaluation  we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls 
our largest stockholder can exercise influence over our affairs 
approximately of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of wesco international are held by cypress group llc cypress and its affiliates 
cypress has the right to nominate one candidate for election to our board of directors  however  currently two of the nine board members are representatives of cypress 
accordingly  cypress and its affiliates can exercise significant influence over our affairs  including the election of our directors  appointment of our management and approval of actions requiring the approval of our stockholders  such as the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and approval of mergers or sales of substantially all of our assets 
there is a risk that the market value of our common stock may decline 
stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations  and the market prices of companies in our industry have been volatile 
it is impossible to predict whether the price of our common stock will rise or fall 
trading prices of our common stock will be influenced by our operating results and prospects and by economic  financial and other factors

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
company overview during  we saw favorable market conditions that reflected improved activity levels in our major end markets  though capital spending in the manufacturing and construction markets we serve still remained below the higher levels experienced in and our financial results in reflect sales growth along with the positive impact from our margin and cost improvement initiatives  which together contributed to improved financial results 
sales increased over the same period last year and our gross margin percentage was compared to in the prior year 
operating income increased by to million primarily from a basis point improvement in gross margins and lower depreciation expense 
the combination of all of these factors led to earnings of per diluted share in  an improvement of per diluted share versus our sales can be categorized as stock  direct ship and special order 
stock orders are filled directly from existing inventory and generally represent approximately of total sales 
approximately of our total sales are direct ship sales 
direct ship sales are typically custom built products  large orders or products that are too bulky to be easily handled and  as a result  are shipped directly to the customer from the supplier 
special orders are for products that are not ordinarily stocked in inventory and are ordered based on a customer s specific request 
special orders represent the remainder of total sales 
our margins between the sales price and net inventory cost on stock and special order sales are approximately higher than those on direct ship sales 
although direct ship gross margins are lower  operating profit margins are generally comparable  since the product handling and fulfillment costs associated with direct shipments are much lower 
we have historically financed our working capital needs  capital expenditures  acquisitions and new branch openings through internally generated cash flow  borrowings under our credit facilities and funding through our accounts receivable securitization program 
during the initial phase of an acquisition or new branch opening  we typically incur expenses related to installing or converting information systems  training employees and other initial operating activities 
with some acquisitions  we may incur expenses in connection with the closure of any of our own redundant branches 
historically  the costs associated with opening new branches  and closing branches in connection with certain acquisitions  have not been material 
we have accounted for our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting 
cash flow we generated million in operating cash flow during included in this amount was a million cash outflow from a reduction in an accounts receivable securitization program the receivables facility  whereby we sell  on a continuous basis  an undivided interest in all domestic accounts receivable to wesco receivables corp  a wholly owned  special purpose entity spe 
in december  we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock 
certain selling stockholders offered an additional million shares of common stock 
our net proceeds were approximately million after deducting the underwriting discounts and offering expenses  exclusive of million related to the expenses of the secondary offering that are included in cash flow from operating activities  and were used to repurchase a portion of our senior subordinated notes in the first quarter of during  we repurchased million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes at a net loss of million  paid million pursuant to the terms of the bruckner purchase agreement and made a payment of million to certain employees for the net equity value of stock options originally granted in and financing availability as of year end  we had approximately million in total available borrowing capacity under our financing facilities  including million under our receivables facility and million under our revolving credit facility  with no significant debt maturities until on march   we redeemed million in aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes 
we funded the redemption by drawing against the receivables facility and our revolving credit facility  thereby reducing our total borrowing capacity by approximately million 

table of contents outlook management believes that if the overall economic recovery forecasted for occurs  it will translate into improved product demand and solid sales growth 
focus on margin expansion and cost containment should continue to drive improved operating performance in our operating cash flow will be utilized to fund any required working capital additions  capital expenditures and  to the extent available to continue our deleveraging efforts  as well as to fund earnout payments related to the bruckner acquisition 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to supplier programs  bad debts  inventories  insurance costs  goodwill  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional adjustments to reserve items may be required 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
gross profit our calculation of gross profit is net sales less cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold include our cost of the products sold and excludes cost for selling  general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization which are reported separately in the statement of income 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we have a systematic procedure using estimates based on historical data and reasonable assumptions of collectibility made at the local branch level and on a consolidated corporate basis to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts 
excess and obsolete inventory we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
a systematic procedure is used to determine excess and obsolete inventory by employing historical data and reasonable assumptions for the percentage of excess and obsolete inventory on a consolidated basis 
supplier rebates we receive rebates from certain suppliers based on contractual arrangements with them 
since there is a lag between actual purchases and the rebates received from the suppliers  we must estimate the approximate amount of rebates available at a specific date 

table of contents goodwill as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we test goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when events or circumstances occur indicating goodwill might be impaired 
this process involves estimating fair value using discounted cash flow analyses 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows 
assumptions used for these estimated cash flows were based on a combination of historical results and current internal forecasts 
two primary assumptions were an average long term revenue growth rate of and an average discount rate of 
we cannot predict certain events that could adversely affect the reported value of goodwill  which totaled million at december  and million at december  insurance programs we use commercial insurance for auto  workers compensation  casualty and health claims as a risk reduction strategy to minimize catastrophic losses 
our strategy involves large deductibles where we must pay all costs up to the deductible amount 
we estimate our reserve based on historical incident rates and costs 
income taxes we record our deferred tax assets at amounts that are expected to be realized 
we evaluate future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the potential need for a valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we review tax issues and positions taken on tax returns and determine the need and amount of contingency reserves necessary to cover any probable audit adjustments 
accounts receivable securitization program we maintain an accounts receivable securitization program whereby an spe sells  without recourse to a third party conduit  all the eligible receivables while maintaining a subordinated interest  in the form of overcollateralization  in a portion of the receivables 
we account for the receivables facility in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
at the time the receivables are sold  the balances are removed from the balance sheet 
the receivables facility represents off balance sheet financing  since the conduit s ownership interest in the accounts receivable of the spe results in the removal of accounts receivable from our consolidated balance sheets  rather than resulting in the addition of a liability to the conduit 
we believe that the terms of the agreements governing this facility qualify our trade receivable sales transactions for sale treatment under generally accepted accounting principles  which requires us to remove the accounts receivable from our consolidated balance sheets 
absent this sale treatment  our consolidated balance sheet would reflect additional accounts receivable and debt 
our consolidated statements of income would not be impacted  except that other expenses would be classified as interest expense 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items in our consolidated statements of income for the periods presented

no additional amounts can be earned under this agreement 
certain other acquisitions also contain contingent consideration provisions  only one of which could require a significant payment 
management estimates this payment could range up to million and would be made in multiple payments between and a prepayment of million was paid in the fourth quarter of related to this acquisition 
in  we anticipate capital expenditures to increase by approximately million from capital expenditures of approximately million  with the majority of the spending to occur in our information technology area 
the required annual principal repayments for all indebtedness for the next five years and thereafter  as of december  in thousands thereafter mortgage financing facility in february  we finalized a mortgage financing facility of million 
total borrowings under the mortgage financing are subject to a year amortization schedule with a balloon payment due at the end of the year term 
proceeds from the borrowings were used primarily to reduce outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
revolving credit facility in march  we entered into a million revolving credit agreement which is collateralized by substantially all of our inventory and also by the accounts receivable of wesco canada 
during  we executed an amendment reducing the size of this revolving credit facility to million 
we recorded a million non cash charge associated with the write off of deferred financing fees related to this reduction 
availability under the facility  which matures in  is limited to the amount of us and canadian eligible inventory and canadian 
table of contents receivables applied against certain advance rates 
borrowings under the facility were used to retire a previous revolving credit facility 
interest on this facility is at libor plus a margin that ranges from to depending upon the amount of excess availability under the facility 
as long as the average daily excess availability for both the preceding and projected succeeding day period is greater than million  then we would be permitted to make acquisitions and repurchase outstanding public stock and bonds  and no financial covenants will apply 
the above permitted transactions would also be allowed if such excess availability is between million and million and our fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined by the agreement  is at least to after taking into consideration the permitted transaction 
additionally  if excess availability under the agreement is less than million  then we must maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of to at december   the interest rate was

on march   we redeemed million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes at a net loss of million 
the loss is due to the payment of a call premium and the write off of the unamortized original issue discount and debt issue costs 
interest rate swap agreements in september  we entered into a million interest rate swap agreement  and in december  we entered into two additional million interest rate swap agreements 
these agreements have terms expiring concurrently with the maturity of our senior subordinated notes and were entered into with the intent of converting million of the senior subordinated notes from a fixed to a floating rate 
pursuant to these agreements  we receive semi annual fixed interest payments at the rate of commencing december  and make semi annual variable interest rate payments at six month libor rates plus a premium in arrears

in  the agreements had the effect of reducing the interest cost on million of the senior notes from to 
the agreements can be terminated by the counterparty in accordance with a redemption schedule that is consistent with the redemption schedule for the senior subordinated notes

net amounts to be received or paid under the swap agreements are reflected as adjustments to interest expense 
bruckner note payable in  we paid million pursuant to the bruckner purchase agreement and converted the remaining amount due into a million note payable million due in june  classified as current debt  and million  due in june  classified as long term debt with interest at

the changes in accounts payable  trade and other receivables and inventories resulted primarily from the increase in business activity during the cash inflow from prepaid expenses and other current assets resulted from the collection of an income tax receivable 
the cash inflow from accrued payroll and benefit costs resulted from the increase in accruals for compensation and benefit programs 
in  cash generated by net income of million plus adjustments for non cash items totaling million along with cash inflows for reductions in inventory of million and increases in accounts payable and other liabilities of million were partially offset by the previously mentioned million reduction in our receivables facility 
investing activities 
net cash used by investing activities was million in  compared to million in net cash used by investing activities was comprised of million in acquisition payments  primarily for the bruckner purchase agreement  and million in capital expenditures 
capital expenditures were million in and million in  and were primarily for computer equipment and software and branch and distribution center facility improvements

additionally  million of outflows related to the repurchase of senior notes and a net million was used to pay down the revolving credit facility 
offsetting these payments were net proceeds from debt attributable to borrowing million from the mortgage financing facility 
contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations  including interest  at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods

generally  our purchase orders and contracts contain clauses allowing for cancellation 
we do not have significant agreements to purchase material or goods that would specify minimum order quantities 
management believes that cash generated from operations  together with amounts available under the credit facility and the receivables facility  will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditures estimated to be million in and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance  however  that this will be or will continue to be the case 
inflation the rate of inflation  as measured by changes in the consumer price index  did not have a material effect on our sales or operating results during the periods presented 
however  inflation in the future could affect our operating costs 
overall  price changes from suppliers have historically been consistent with inflation and have not had a material impact on the results of operations 
however  as discussed in the results of operation  we did experience a significant rise in the price of certain commodity products 
we were able to pass through a majority of the increase to customers in seasonality our operating results are affected by certain seasonal factors 
sales are typically at their lowest during the first quarter due to a reduced level of activity during the winter months 
sales increase during the warmer months beginning in march and continuing through november 
sales drop again slightly in december as the weather cools and also as a result of a reduced level of activity during the holiday season 
as a result  we report sales and earnings in the first quarter that are generally lower than that of the remaining quarters 

table of contents impact of recently issued accounting standards in january  the fasb issued interpretation no

this interpretation requires unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse the risk and rewards of ownership among their owners and other parties involved 
this interpretation  as amended  is effective for all entities subject to this interpretation no later than the end of the first period that ends after march  the adoption of this interpretation did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
foreign currency risks approximately of our sales are denominated in u 
s 
dollars and are primarily from customers in the united states 
as a result  currency fluctuations are currently not material to our operating results 
we do have foreign subsidiaries located in north america  europe and asia and may establish additional foreign subsidiaries in the future 
accordingly  we may derive a more significant portion of our sales from international operations  and a portion of these sales may be denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  our future operating results could become subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates of those currencies in relation to the us dollar 
furthermore  to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in us dollars  an increase in the value of the u 
s 
dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
we have and will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations 
interest rate risks our outstanding indebtedness as of december  is comprised of million of fixed rate borrowings 
in september  we entered into a million interest rate swap agreement  and in december  we entered into two additional million interest rate swap agreements 
at december   the net fair value of outstanding interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges was a liability of million
