item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with  and are derived from  our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions  which could cause actual results to differ materially from management s expectations 
important factors that could cause these differences include those described in factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we use the terms open solutions  we  us and our to refer to the business of open solutions inc and our subsidiaries 
all references to years  unless otherwise noted  refer to our fiscal years  which end on december overview we are a provider of software and services that allow financial institutions to compete and service their customers more effectively 
we develop  market  license and support an enterprise wide suite of software and services that perform a financial institution s data processing and information management functions  including account  transaction  lending  operations  back office  client information and reporting 
our complementary products and services supplement our core software to provide our clients with fully integrated business intelligence  customer relationship management  or crm  check imaging  internet banking and cash management  general ledger and profitability  loan origination  interactive voice solutions and check and item processing functions 
our software can be operated either by the financial institution itself  on an outsourced basis in one of our outsourcing centers or through an outsourcing center hosted by one of our resellers 
substantially all of our historical revenue has been generated through the licensing of our core software and our complementary products and the provision of related services and maintenance to small and mid size commercial banks and thrifts and credit unions of all sizes 
in connection with our acquisition of datawest solutions inc in october  we also derive revenue from payment processing services 
we derive revenues from two primary sources sales of licenses for our core software and complementary products  and fees from installation  training  maintenance and support services  as well as fees generated from our outsourcing centers and the outsourcing centers hosted by our resellers 
our revenues have grown from approximately million in to approximately million in this growth has resulted primarily from strategic acquisitions and internal expansion  through which we have developed and acquired new products and services and have expanded the number of clients using one or more of our products to approximately  financial institutions as of december  
table of contents software license revenue includes fees received from the licensing of application software 
we license our proprietary software products under standard agreements which typically provide our clients with a perpetual non exclusive  non transferable right to use the software for a single financial institution upon payment of a license fee 
we also license certain third party software products to end users 
we generate service and maintenance fees by converting clients to our core software suite  installing our software  assisting our clients in operating the applications  modifying and updating the software and providing outsourcing services 
our software license agreements typically provide for five years of support and maintenance 
we perform outsourcing services through our outsourcing centers and our check and item processing centers 
revenues from outsourcing center services and the check and item processing centers are derived from monthly usage fees  typically under three to five year service contracts with our clients 
we derive other revenues from hardware sales and client reimbursement of out of pocket and telecommunications costs 
we have entered into agreements with several hardware manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware and related services  primarily to our check imaging clients 
client reimbursements represent direct costs paid to third parties primarily for data communication  postage and travel 
we expect that our revenues from installation  training  maintenance  support services  our outsourcing centers and the outsourcing centers hosted by our resellers will continue to expand as our base of clients expands 
our maintenance revenues are the largest of these revenue components  and we expect that these revenues  due to their recurring nature  will continue to be a significant portion of our total revenue as our client base grows 
in the fourth quarter of  we have reversed the valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets because we have determined that it is more likely than not that current and future net income will allow for the realization of these assets 
as a result  we have recorded an income tax benefit directly related to the reversal of the valuation allowance of million in the fourth quarter 
the remainder of the valuation allowance reversal was primarily recorded as an increase to equity of million 
for subsequent periods  we anticipate recording a tax provision against income at our effective tax rate 
however  we do not expect to incur significant federal tax payments until all anticipated net operating loss carry forwards are utilized 
we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to datawest solutions inc on march   we acquired the us based services to credit unions business of cgi ams inc  a provider of core processing solutions for credit unions  for cash consideration of approximately million 
we believe this acquisition will increase our core data processing client base among credit unions and increase the recurring revenue component of our revenues

we also generate revenues from installation  training  maintenance and support services provided to clients  from outsourcing center services and from hardware sales related to our check imaging and telephony businesses 
revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to a million increase in licensing revenue from our core and complementary products attributable to sales to new clients  including those clients of our acquired entities  sales of additional products to existing clients and an increase in license fees from bisys

product development 
product development expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to a million increase in product development expenses from the acquired businesses

in addition  we experienced a decrease in sales of low margin hardware during the period 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to a incremental million increase in sales and marketing expenses from owning the hnc business for a full year and owning liberty fitech systems inc for six months in sales and marketing expenses represented of revenues for the year ended december  as opposed to of revenues for the year ended december  sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily because we did not increase our sales or marketing expenses significantly  but revenues continued to grow

table of contents acquisitions of liberty fitech systems  inc and hnc financial solutions  as well as the draw down on our credit facility offset by interest earned on the investment of the proceeds of the initial public offering 
income tax benefit provision 
income tax provision increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily because of increased profitability resulting in higher state tax expense for states where the company has no loss carryforward or where state net operating losses were temporary suspended and deferred tax expense related to the tax amortization of goodwill from the liberty fitech systems inc acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources at december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and million  respectively 
the following table sets forth the elements of our cash flow statement for the following periods year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities cash from operating activities cash provided by operations for the year ended december  was attributable to net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million partially offset by a deferred tax benefit of million resulting primarily from the reversal of the valuation allowance and an increase in working capital of million primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable

total capital expenditures for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively  and were primarily related to the purchase of computer equipment  computer software  software development services  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements 
t he increase in capital expenditures relates primarily to the implementation of a new enterprise software system and leasehold improvements at our new corporate lease facility 
we currently have no significant capital spending or purchase commitments  but expect to continue to engage in capital spending in the ordinary course of business 
at december   we held million in marketable securities 
during the year ended december   we purchased million of marketable securities and sold million of marketable securities 
additionally  net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  included million used for acquisitions 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  included million used for the acquisition of liberty fitech systems  inc net cash used in investing activities for acquisitions was  for the year ended december  
table of contents cash from financing activities on may   we completed a follow on offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
of the  shares offered   shares were offered by open solutions and  shares were offered by certain of our existing stockholders 
on june   the underwriters exercised their option to purchase  additional shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the aggregate net proceeds from the offering were million 
during the year ended december   we also received approximately million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and  from the issuance of common stock in connection with our employee stock purchase program 
on december   we completed our initial public offering raising proceeds  net of expenses  of million 
on february   we sold senior subordinated convertible notes due  which we call the notes  with an aggregate principal amount at maturity of million to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to exemptions from the registration requirements of the securities act of  afforded by section and rule a 
we also granted to the note purchasers an option  which was exercised in full  to purchase additional notes with an aggregate principal amount at maturity of million 
the issue price of the notes was per  principal amount at maturity of notes  which resulted in aggregate gross proceeds to us of approximately million 
the notes are our general unsecured obligations and are junior to any of our existing and future senior indebtedness 
the notes bear cash interest at a rate of per year on the issue price until february  after that date  original issue discount will accrue on the notes at a rate of per year on a semi annual bond equivalent basis 
on the maturity date  a holder will receive  in cash per  principal amount at maturity of notes 
these notes do not include any financial covenants 
we currently anticipate that our current cash balance and cash flow from operations  including the proceeds from the convertible notes issued in february  will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated capital needs for the next twelve months  but may be insufficient to provide funds necessary for any future acquisitions we may make during that time 
to the extent we require additional funds  whether for acquisitions or otherwise  we may seek additional equity or debt financing 
such financing may not be available to us on terms that are acceptable to us  if at all  and any equity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders 
to the extent we obtain additional debt financing  our debt service obligations will increase and the relevant debt instruments may  among other things  impose additional restrictions on our operations  require us to comply with additional financial covenants or require us to pledge assets to secure our borrowings 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt to customers capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual obligations 
table of contents in february  we sold senior subordinated convertible notes due with an aggregate principal amount at maturity of million 
these notes are not included in the above table 
income taxes in the fourth quarter of  we reversed the valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets because we determined that it is more likely than not that current and future net income will allow for the realization of these assets 
as a result  we recorded an income tax benefit of million in the fourth quarter directly related to the reversal of the valuation allowance 
the remainder of the valuation allowance reversal was primarily recorded as an increase to equity of million 
for subsequent periods  we anticipate recording a tax provision against income at our effective tax rate 
however  we do not expect to incur significant federal tax payments until all anticipated net operating loss carry forwards are utilized 
we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to datawest solutions inc at december   the company had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that begin expiring in  had approximately million of state net operating loss carryforwards  which begin to expire in and had approximately million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards  which begin to expire in at december   the company had approximately million of federal research and development credit carryforwards that begin to expire in and approximately  of state research and development carryforwards with an unlimited carryforward period 
as defined in section of the internal revenue code  certain ownership changes limit the annual utilization of federal net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
we experienced such an ownership change in the follow on offering has resulted in a second ownership change 
this limitation of the utilization of federal net operating losses imposed by section is applied annually and is equal to a published long term exempt rate multiplied by the aggregate fair value of the company immediately prior to the ownership change 
this resulting limitation may also be increased by imputed tax deductions of certain intangibles resulting from built in gains  as defined 
we do not believe that the section limitation with respect to the ownership change nor the change that resulted from the follow on offering will result in the loss of any net operating losses or tax credit carry forwards prior to their expiration 
as a result of future issuance of  sales of  and other transactions involving our common stock  we may experience an ownership change in the future  which could cause such federal net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards to be subject to limitation under section acquisitions since august  we have expanded our product offerings and client base through the acquisition of nine businesses

critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require that management make numerous estimates and assumptions 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions  impacting our reported results of operations and financial position 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the critical accounting policies described below are those that are most important to the depiction of our financial condition and results of operations and their application requires management s most subjective judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we generate revenues from licensing the rights to use our software products and certain third party software products to clients 
we also generate revenues from installation  training  maintenance and support services provided to clients  from outsourcing center services  hardware sales related to our check imaging and voice response businesses and fees collected on transactions in our payment processing business 

table of contents we recognize software license revenue when a noncancelable license agreement has been executed  fees are fixed or determinable  the software has been delivered  accepted by the client if acceptance is required by the contract and other than perfunctory  and collection is considered probable 
the software licenses are sold in conjunction with professional services for installation  training  maintenance and support 
for these arrangements  a portion of the total contract value is attributed first to the maintenance arrangement based on its fair value  which is derived from renewal rates 
another portion of the contract value is then attributed to installation and training services based on estimated fair value  which is derived from rates charged for similar services provided on a stand alone basis multiplied by estimated hours to complete 
our software license agreements generally do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software  and accordingly  installation and training services are not considered essential to functionality 
the remainder of the total contract value is then attributed to the software licenses based on the residual method 
the estimated hours and hourly rate for installation and training services affect the timing and amount of revenue recognized from license fees and installation and training services 
due to the uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  actual hours to complete installation and training services or the estimated hourly rate of these services may differ from estimates 
if significant customization of our software is required  we recognize all revenue using the percentage of completion method 
the complexity of some software license agreements requires us to routinely apply judgments regarding the application of software recognition accounting principles to specific agreements and transactions 
different judgments and estimates could have led to different accounting conclusions  which could have had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
revenues from software maintenance are typically generated under five year agreements and are recognized ratably over the life of the agreements 
revenues from installation and training services are recognized as services are performed 
we calculate revenue recognition for installation and training services based on the ratio of hours incurred to estimated total hours for the project 
accordingly  we must estimate the hours to complete the installation and training  and it is possible that estimates may be revised 
these revisions are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined  and changes in these estimates could have a material effect on our financial statements 
data center revenues associated with allowing customers to utilize our software products on an outsourced basis and payment transaction processing revenues are recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and the service has been provided 
the company obtains signed contracts  which indicate the key terms  as well as the fixed and determinable fees  in each arrangement 
revenues and related costs associated with installation of data center and transaction processing arrangements are recognized over the term of the arrangement  typically to years 
we are receiving payments under certain license and marketing agreements with resellers 
we have provided a master license to our two primary resellers bisys  inc and connecticut on line computer center  inc  or cocc  and do not have any other continuing obligation to provide additional products or services  other than the provision of client support and maintenance 
we recognize revenue when the revenue recognition criteria under sop no 
are met  including when evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed and determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and delivery has occurred 
we recognize minimum quarterly non refundable payments and any additional license fees as revenue in the quarter that they are due 
we typically recognize hardware revenue upon product shipment  including our voice response systems and other standard hardware equipment 
we recognize certain hardware revenue related to our check imaging products on a percentage of completion basis because installation services related to these arrangements and the software related to these arrangements are considered essential to the functionality of certain of the hardware 
deferred revenue is comprised of payments received related to product delivery  maintenance and other services  which have been paid by customers prior to the recognition of revenue 
deferred revenue relates primarily to cash received for maintenance contracts in advance of services performed  which is recognized as revenue ratably as services are performed 
deferred costs are comprised of costs incurred prior to the recognition of related revenue 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
the amount of our reserve is based on historical experience and our analysis of the accounts receivable balance outstanding 
if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would result in an additional expense in the period that this determination was made 
while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
such estimates require significant judgment on the part of our management 
therefore  changes in the assumptions underlying our estimates or changes in the financial condition of our clients could result in a different required allowance  which would have a material effect on our results of operations 
stock compensation we apply the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles whereby compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period to the extent that the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant exceeds the exercise price of the employee stock option 
for periods prior to our initial public offering  the calculation of the intrinsic value of a stock award was based on management s estimate of the fair value of our common stock 
beginning in the third quarter of  we will be required to recognize expense pursuant to sfas r for stock based compensation 
valuation of stock options requires significant estimates related to volatility and option life  and changes in these estimates would have a material impact on our stock based compensation expense when the provisions of sfas r are adopted 
software development costs software development costs for new software products and additional modules for existing software are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is established 
technological feasibility is established when a working model of the product has been completed and completeness of the working model and its consistency with the product design has been confirmed by testing 
internal software development costs qualifying for capitalization under sfas no 
have not been significant 
accounting for purchase business combinations all of our acquisitions were accounted for as purchase transactions  and the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the fair value of the acquired company s then current assets  purchased technology  property and equipment and liabilities 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired or net liabilities assumed has been allocated to goodwill 
the fair value of amortizable intangibles  primarily consisting of purchased technology  was determined using an estimate of discounted future cash flows related to the technology 
actual future cash flows from purchased technology could differ from estimated future cash flows 
the allocation between amortizable intangibles and goodwill impacts future amortization expense in the financial statements 
we amortize intangibles over their estimated economic lives 
while we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets will occur in the near term  rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and our future operating results 
deferred revenue acquired in business combinations is recorded based on the fair value of the legal obligation 
we measure fair value as the cost to fulfill the obligation plus our historical profit margin on these services 
changes in the estimate of fair value of deferred revenue could have a material impact on the purchase price allocation and future recognition of revenue 

table of contents long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
we also perform an annual impairment test of goodwill 
we assess potential impairment through a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit versus its carrying value 
the estimated fair value of goodwill and intangible assets is based on a number of factors including past operating results  budgets  economic projections  market trends  product development cycles  and estimated future cash flows 
changes in these assumptions and estimates could cause a material impact on our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  which requires companies to recognize in their statement of operations the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees 
sfas no 
r is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june  accordingly  we will adopt sfas no 
r in our third quarter of sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including stock options and stock issued under certain employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized in the financial statements at their fair value 
sfas r will require us to estimate future forfeitures of stock based compensation  while the current pro forma disclosure includes only those options that have been forfeited during the current period 
therefore  we believe that the pro forma expense currently disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements represents an estimate of the amounts that would have been recorded under the provisions of sfas r 
we have not yet determined which fair value method and transitional provision we will follow 
we are currently evaluating our stock based compensation plan  to determine if changes should be made to minimize compensation charges resulting from the adoption of sfas r 
in october  the fasb ratified eitf  accounting issues related to certain features of contingently convertible debt and the effect on diluted earnings per share 
the new rules require companies to include shares issuable upon conversion of contingently convertible debt in their diluted earnings per share calculations regardless of whether the debt has a market price trigger that is above the current fair market value of the company s common stock that makes the debt currently not convertible 
the new rules are effective for reporting periods ending on or after december  in february  we completed an offering of convertible debt 
the dilutive effect of shares from this debt will be included in the diluted earnings per share calculation using the if converted method 
in december  the fasb issued fsp no 
application of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of  which provides guidance with respect to recording the potential impact of repatriation provisions of the american job creation act of the jobs act to enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
the jobs act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing a dividends reduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and uncertainty remains as to how the interpret certain provisions in the jobs act 
as such  we have not yet determined whether  and to what extent  we might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the us 
table of contents factors that may affect future results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
we are dependent on the banking and credit union industry  and changes within that industry could reduce demand for our products and services 
the large majority of our revenues are derived from financial institutions in the banking and credit union industry  primarily small to mid size banks and thrifts and credit unions of all sizes  and we expect to continue to derive substantially all of our revenues from these institutions for the foreseeable future 
unfavorable economic conditions adversely impacting the banking and credit union industry could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  financial institutions in the banking and credit union industry have experienced  and may continue to experience  cyclical fluctuations in profitability as well as increasing challenges to improve their operating efficiencies 
due to the entrance of non traditional competitors and the current environment of low interest rates  the profit margins of commercial banks  thrifts and credit unions have narrowed 
as a result  some banks have slowed  and may continue to slow  their capital spending  including spending on computer software and hardware  which can negatively impact license sales of our core and complementary products to new and existing clients 
decreases in or reallocation of capital expenditures by our current and potential clients  unfavorable economic conditions and new or persisting competitive pressures could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
consolidation in the banking and financial services industry could adversely impact our business by eliminating a number of our existing and potential clients 
there has been and continues to be merger  acquisition and consolidation activity in the banking and financial services industry 
mergers or consolidations of banks and financial institutions in the future could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients 
a smaller market for our services could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
in addition  it is possible that the larger banks or financial institutions which result from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform themselves some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide 
if that were to occur  it could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
our success depends on decisions by potential clients to replace their legacy computer systems  and their failure to do so would adversely affect demand for our products and services 
we primarily derive our revenues from two sources license fees for software products and fees for a full range of services complementing our products  including outsourcing  installation  training  maintenance and support services 
a large portion of these fees are either directly attributable to licenses of our core software system or are generated over time by clients using our core software 
banks and credit unions historically have been slow to adapt to and accept new technologies 
many of these financial institutions have traditionally met their information technology needs through legacy computer systems  in which they have often invested significant resources 
as a result  these financial institutions may be inclined to resist replacing their legacy systems with our core software system 
our future financial performance will depend in part on the successful development  introduction and client acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our core software system and our other complementary products 
a decline in demand for  or failure to achieve broad market acceptance of  our core software system or any enhanced version as a result of competition  technological change or otherwise  will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents if we fail to expand our outsourcing business and other sources of recurring revenue  we may be unable to successfully implement our business strategy 
we can host a financial institution s data processing functions at our outsourcing centers 
our outsourcing centers currently serve clients using our core software and our internet banking  atm  cview  cash management  collections  automated clearing house  or ach  processing  check and item processing and telephony products 
in the future  we plan to offer all of our products in our outsourcing centers and continue to market our outsourcing services aggressively 
our outsourcing services provide a source of recurring revenue which can grow as the number of accounts processed for a client increases 
we also seek to generate recurring revenue through our licensing model  which generates additional fees for us as a client s business grows or it adds more software applications  as well as through the provision of maintenance  support and other professional services 
our maintenance revenues are the largest of these revenue components  and we expect that these revenues will continue to be a significant portion of our total revenues as our client base grows due to their recurring nature 
to the extent we fail to persuade new or existing clients to purchase our outsourcing services or we are unable to offer some or all of our products to clients on an outsourced basis  we will be unable to implement our strategy and our revenue may be less predictable 
we have had several consecutive profitable quarters  but we may not achieve continued sustained profitability 
we were incorporated in may and did not release our first product until accordingly  our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies with limited operating histories 
although we have been profitable for the year ended december   we may not be profitable in future periods  either on a short or long term basis 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
there can be no assurance that operating losses will not recur in the future  that we will sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis or that our actual results will meet our projections  expectations or announced guidance 
to the extent that revenues do not grow at anticipated rates  increases in operating expenses precede or are not subsequently followed by commensurate increases in revenues or we are unable to adjust operating expense levels accordingly  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology or in the marketplace  we could lose existing clients and be unable to attract new business 
the markets for our software products and services are characterized by technological change  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable in short periods of time 
we expect new products and services  and enhancements to existing products and services  to continue to be developed and introduced by others  which will compete with  and reduce the demand for  our products and services 
our products life cycles are difficult to estimate 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to enhance our current products and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing  marketing  licensing and selling new products or product enhancements that meet these changing demands  that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these products or that our new products and product enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
we encounter a long sales and implementation cycle requiring significant capital commitments by our clients which they may be unwilling or unable to make 
the implementation of our core software system involves significant capital commitments by our clients 
potential clients generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available software and require us to 
table of contents expend substantial time  effort and money educating them as to the value of our software 
sales of our core processing software products require an extensive education and marketing effort throughout a client s organization because decisions relating to licensing our core processing software generally involve the evaluation of the software by senior management and a significant number of client personnel in various functional areas  each having specific and often conflicting requirements 
we may expend significant funds and management resources during the sales cycle and ultimately fail to close the sale 
our core software product sales cycle generally ranges between six to nine months  and our implementation cycle for our core software generally ranges between six to nine months 
our sales cycle for all of our products and services is subject to significant risks and delays over which we have little or no control  including our clients budgetary constraints  the timing of our clients budget cycles and approval processes  our clients willingness to replace their core software solution vendor  the success and continued support of our strategic marketing partners sales efforts  and the timing and expiration of our clients current license agreements or outsourcing agreements for similar services 
if we are unsuccessful in closing sales after expending significant funds and management resources or if we experience delays as discussed above  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we utilize certain key technologies from third parties  and may be unable to replace those technologies if they become obsolete or incompatible with our products 
our proprietary software is designed to work in conjunction with certain third party software products  including microsoft and oracle relational databases 
although we believe that there are alternatives to these products generally available to us  any significant interruption in the supply of such third party software could have a material adverse effect on our sales unless and until we can replace the functionality provided by these products 
in addition  we are dependent upon these third parties abilities to enhance their current products  to develop new products on a timely and cost effective basis and to respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to replace the functionality provided by the third party software currently offered in conjunction with our products in the event that such software becomes obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products or is otherwise not adequately maintained or updated 
the absence of  or any significant delay in  the replacement of that functionality could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  delays in the release of new and upgraded versions of third party software products  particularly the oracle relational database management system  could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
because of the complexities inherent in developing sophisticated software products and the lengthy testing periods associated with these products  no assurance can be given that our future product introductions will not be delayed 
we operate in a competitive business environment  and if we are unable to compete effectively  we may face price reductions and decreased demand for our products 
the market for our products and services is intensely competitive and subject to technological change 
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services they offer 
we encounter competition from a number of sources  all of which offer core software systems to the banking and credit union industry 
we expect additional competition from other established and emerging companies as the market for core processing software solutions and complementary products continues to develop and expand 
we also expect that competition will increase as a result of software industry consolidation  including particularly the acquisition of any of our competitors or any of the retail banking system providers by one of 
table of contents the larger service providers to the banking industry 
we encounter competition in the united states from a number of sources  including fiserv  inc  jack henry associates  inc  fidelity national financial corporation and john h 
harland company  all of which offer core processing systems or outsourcing alternatives to banks  thrifts and credit unions 
some of our current  and many of our potential  competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger client bases and significantly greater financial  engineering  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
as a result  these companies may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in client demands or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective clients 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and acquire significant market share 
we expect that the banking and credit union software market will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies  possibly involving alternative technologies that are more sophisticated and cost effective than our technology 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us will not materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
an impairment of the value of our goodwill  capitalized software costs and other intangible assets could significantly reduce our earnings 
we periodically review several items on our balance sheet for impairment and record an impairment charge if we determine that the value of our assets has been impaired 
as of december   we had approximately million of goodwill  million of capitalized software costs and million of other intangible assets 
we periodically review these assets for impairment 
if we determine that the carrying value of these assets are not recoverable  we would record an impairment charge against our results of operations 
such an impairment charge may be significant  and we are unable to predict the amount  in any  of potential future impairments 
in addition  if we engage in additional acquisitions  we may incur additional goodwill  capitalized software costs and other intangible assets 
our quarterly revenues  operating results and profitability will vary from quarter to quarter  which may result in volatility in our stock price 
our quarterly revenues  operating results and profitability have varied in the past and are likely to continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
this may lead to volatility in our stock price 
these fluctuations are due to several factors relating to the license and sale of our products  including the timing  size and nature of our licensing transactions  lengthy and unpredictable sales cycles  the timing of introduction and market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  the timing of acquisitions by us of businesses and products  product and price competition  the relative proportions of revenues derived from license fees and services  changes in our operating expenses  software bugs or other product quality problems  and personnel changes and fluctuations in economic and financial market conditions 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
there can be no assurance that future revenues and results of operations will not vary substantially 
it is also possible that in future quarters  our results of operations will be below the expectations of public market 
table of contents analysts or investors or our announced guidance 
in either case  the price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected 
we face a lengthy sales cycle for our core software  which may cause fluctuations in our revenues from quarter to quarter 
we may not be able to increase revenue or decrease expenses to meet expectations for a given quarter 
we recognize software license revenues upon delivery and  if required by the underlying agreement  upon client acceptance  if such criteria is other than perfunctory  which does not always occur in the same quarter in which the software license agreement for the system is signed 
as a result  we are constrained in our ability to increase our software license revenue in any quarter if there are unexpected delays in delivery or required acceptance of systems for which software licenses were signed in previous quarters 
implementation of our core software system typically occurs over six to nine months 
delays in the delivery  implementation or any required acceptance of our products could materially adversely affect our quarterly results of operations 
revenues from software license sales accounted for of revenues for the year ended december   of revenues for the year ended december   of revenues for the year ended december  and of revenues for the year ended december  we expect that revenues from software license sales will continue to provide a significant percentage of our revenues in future periods  and our ability to close license sales  as well as the timing of those sales  may have a material impact on our quarterly results 
in addition  increased sales and marketing expenses for any given quarter may negatively impact operating results of that quarter due to lack of recognition of associated revenues until the delivery of the product in a subsequent quarter 
our level of fixed expenses may cause us to incur operating losses if we are unsuccessful in maintaining our current revenue levels 
our expense levels are based  in significant part  on our expectations as to future revenues and are largely fixed in the short term 
as a result  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in revenues 
accordingly  any significant shortfall of revenues in relation to our expectations would have an immediate and materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  as we expand we would anticipate increasing our operating expenses to expand our installation  product development  sales and marketing and administrative organizations 
the time of such expansion and the rate at which new personnel become productive could cause material losses to the extent we do not generate additional revenue 
we rely on our direct sales force to generate revenue  and may be unable to hire additional sales personnel in a timely manner 
we rely primarily on our direct sales force to sell licenses of our core software system 
we may need to hire additional sales  client care and implementation personnel in the near term and beyond if we are to achieve revenue growth in the future 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing sales  customer service and implementation personnel or will be able to attract  assimilate or retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future 
if we are unable to hire or retain qualified sales personnel on a timely basis  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we receive a portion of our revenues from relationships with strategic marketing partners  and if we lose one or more of these marketing partners or fail to add new ones it could have a negative impact on our business 
we expect that revenues generated from the sale of our products and services by our strategic marketing partners will account for a meaningful portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
in particular  we expect that bisys  a national outsourcing center  will account for a meaningful portion of our revenues over time 
during the year ended december   bisys represented approximately million  or  
table of contents of our total revenues 
during the fiscal year ended december   bisys represented approximately million  or  of our total revenues 
our strategic marketing partners pay us license fees based on the volume of products and services that they sell 
if we lose one or more of our major strategic marketing partners  we may be unable in a timely manner  or at all  to replace them with another entity with comparable client bases and user demographics  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we plan to supplement our existing distribution partners with other national and regional outsourcing centers 
if we are unable to identify appropriate resellers and enter into arrangements with them for the outsourcing of our products and services to financial institutions  we may not be able to sustain or grow our business 
if we do not retain our senior management and other key employees  we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy 
we have grown significantly in recent years  and our management remains concentrated in a small number of key employees 
our future success depends to a significant extent on our executive officers and key employees  including our sales force and software professionals  particularly project managers  software engineers and other senior technical personnel 
the loss of the services of any of these individuals or group of individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition for qualified personnel in the software industry is intense and we compete for these personnel with other software companies that have greater financial and other resources than we do 
our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified personnel  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
any difficulty in hiring needed personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on internally developed software and systems as well as third party products  any of which may contain errors and bugs 
our software may contain undetected errors  defects or bugs 
although we have not suffered significant harm from any errors or defects to date  we may discover significant errors or defects in the future that we may or may not be able to correct 
our products involve integration with products and systems developed by third parties 
complex software programs of third parties may contain undetected errors or bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in our existing or future products or third party products upon which our products are dependent  with the possible result of delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products  diversion of our resources  injury to our reputation and increased service and warranty expenses and or payment of damages 
we could be sued for contract or product liability claims and lawsuits may disrupt our business  divert management s attention or have an adverse effect on our financial results 
failures in a client s system could result in an increase in service and warranty costs or a claim for substantial damages against us 
there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts would be enforceable or would otherwise protect us from liability for damages 
we maintain general liability insurance coverage  including coverage for errors and omissions in excess of the applicable deductible amount 
there can be no assurance that this coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims  or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim 
the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage  or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies  including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  litigation  regardless of its outcome  could result in substantial cost to us and divert management s attention from our operations 
any contract liability claim or litigation against us could  therefore  have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  because many of our projects are business critical projects for financial institutions  a failure or inability to meet a client s expectations could seriously damage our reputation and affect our ability to attract new business 

table of contents our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our senior subordinated convertible notes 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our stockholders and noteholders 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our notes  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  product development efforts and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and limit our ability to borrow additional funds 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments  or if we fail to comply with the various requirements of our notes or any indebtedness that we may incur in the future  we would be in default  which would permit the holders of the notes and the holders of such other indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of the notes or such other indebtedness  as the case may be  and could cause defaults under the notes and such other indebtedness 
any default under the notes or any indebtedness that we may incur in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  liquidity and financial condition 
government regulation of our business could cause us to incur significant expenses  and failure to comply with applicable regulations could make our business less efficient or impossible 
the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation 
financial institutions  including banks  thrifts and credit unions  operate under high levels of governmental supervision 
our clients must ensure that our products and services work within the extensive and evolving regulatory requirements applicable to them  including those under federal and state truth in lending and truth in deposit rules  usury laws  the equal credit opportunity act  the fair housing act  the electronic fund transfer act  the fair credit reporting act  the bank secrecy act  the community reinvestment act  the gramm leach bliley act of  the usa patriot act and other state and local laws and regulations 
the compliance of our products and services with these requirements may depend on a variety of factors  including the product at issue and whether the client is a bank  thrift  credit union or other type of financial institution 
neither federal depository institution regulators nor other federal or state regulators of financial services require us to obtain any licenses 
we are subject to examination by federal depository institution regulators under the bank service company act 
although we believe we are not subject to direct supervision by federal and state banking agencies relating to other regulations  we have from time to time agreed to examinations of our business and operations by these agencies 
these regulators have broad supervisory authority to remedy any shortcomings identified in any such examination 
federal  state or foreign authorities could also adopt laws  rules or regulations relating to the financial services industry that affect our business  such as requiring us or our clients to comply with data  record keeping and processing and other requirements 
it is possible that laws and regulations may be enacted or modified with respect to the internet  covering issues such as end user privacy  pricing  content  characteristics  taxation and quality of services and products 
adoption of these laws  rules or regulations could render our business or operations more costly and burdensome or less efficient and could require us to modify our current or future products or services 

table of contents our limited ability to protect our proprietary technology and other rights may adversely affect our ability to compete 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as licensing agreements  third party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate to prevent our competitors from copying or reverse engineering our products  or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information  we require employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements 
we cannot assure you that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use  misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information 
we do not include in our products any mechanism to prevent unauthorized copying and any such unauthorized copying could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have no patents  and existing copyright laws afford only limited protection for our intellectual property rights and may not protect such rights in the event competitors independently develop products similar to ours 
in addition  the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be licensed do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others  we could be required to redesign our products  pay royalties or enter into license agreements with third parties 
although we have never been the subject of a material intellectual property dispute  there can be no assurance that a third party will not assert that our technology violates its intellectual property rights in the future 
as the number of software products in our target market increases and the functionality of these products further overlap  we believe that software developers may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
any claims  whether with or without merit  could be expensive and time consuming to defend  cause us to cease making  licensing or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  require us to redesign our products  if feasible  divert management s attention and resources  and require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to our current or future products or that any such assertion will not require us to enter into royalty arrangements  if available  or litigation that could be costly to us 
we have entered into and may continue to enter into or seek to enter into business combinations and acquisitions which may be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or divert management attention 
since  we have acquired ten businesses 
as part of our business strategy  we may enter into additional business combinations and acquisitions in the future 
some of these business combinations and acquisitions may be material to our business 
we have limited experience in making acquisitions 
in addition  acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks  including the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  the maintenance of acceptable standards  controls  procedures and policies  the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management  
table of contents the impairment of relationships with employees and clients as a result of any integration of new management and other personnel  the inability to maintain relationships with clients of the acquired business  the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and services  the failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition  expenses related to the acquisition  potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses  and unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into existing technology 
if we are not successful in completing acquisitions that we may pursue in the future  we would be required to reevaluate our growth strategy and we may have incurred substantial expenses and devoted significant management time and resources in seeking to complete the acquisitions 
in addition  with future acquisitions  we could use substantial portions of our available cash as all or a portion of the purchase price 
we could also issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities as consideration for these acquisitions  which could cause our stockholders to suffer significant dilution and could adversely affect the rights of the holders of the notes 
any future acquisitions may not generate additional revenue for us 
we may not have sufficient funds available to pay amounts due under our senior subordinated convertible notes 
we will be required to pay cash to holders of our senior subordinated convertible notes upon purchase of the notes by us at the option of holders on february in each of    and  in an amount equal to the issue price and accrued original issue discount plus accrued and unpaid cash interest and liquidated damages  if any  upon purchase of the notes by us at the option of holders upon some changes of control  in an amount equal to the issue price and accrued original issue discount plus accrued and unpaid cash interest and liquidated damages  if any  at maturity of the notes  in an amount equal to the entire outstanding principal amount  and in the event that we elect to pay cash in lieu of the delivery of shares of common stock upon conversion of the notes  upon conversion  in an amount up to the conversion value of the notes 
we may not have sufficient funds available or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to satisfy these obligations 
a failure to pay amounts due under the notes upon repurchase  at maturity or upon conversion in the event we elect to pay cash in lieu of shares of common stock upon conversion  would constitute an event of default under the indenture  which could  in turn  constitute a default under the terms of any other indebtedness 
we face risks associated with our canadian operations that could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
on october   we completed the acquisition of datawest solutions inc  a provider of banking and payment technology solutions located in vancouver  british columbia  canada 
although historically we have not generated significant revenues from operations outside the united states  we expect that the portion of our revenues generated by our international operations will increase as a result of our acquisition of datawest 
as is the case with most international operations  the success and profitability of such operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that include  in addition to the risks our business as a whole faces  the following difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  differing regulatory and industry standards and certification requirements  
table of contents the complexities of foreign tax jurisdictions  currency exchange rate fluctuations  and import or export licensing requirements 
to service our indebtedness  we will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness  including our notes  and to fund planned capital expenditures and product development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness  including the notes  or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  including the notes  on or before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  including the notes  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we fail to effectively manage our growth  our financial results could be adversely affected 
we have expanded our operations rapidly in recent years 
for example  our aggregate revenues increased from approximately million in to approximately million in as of december   we had employees  up from as of december  in addition  we continue to explore ways to extend our target markets  including to larger financial institutions  international clients  and clients in the payroll services  insurance and brokerage industries 
our growth may place a strain on our management systems  information systems and resources 
our ability to successfully offer products and services and implement our business plan requires adequate information systems and resources and oversight from our senior management 
we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial controls  reporting systems and procedures as we continue to grow and expand our business 
as we grow  we must also continue to hire  train  supervise and manage new employees 
we may not be able to hire  train  supervise and manage sufficient personnel or develop management and operating systems to manage our expansion effectively 
if we are unable to manage our growth  our operations and financial results could be adversely affected 
the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract management 
as a public company  we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of and the sarbanes oxley act of these requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources 
the securities exchange act requires  among other things  that we file annual  quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition 
the sarbanes oxley act requires  among other things  that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls for financial reporting 
we currently do not have an internal audit group 
in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  significant resources and management oversight will be required 
as a result  management s attention may be diverted from other business concerns  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  we may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge and we may not be able to do so in a timely fashion 
failure to continue to comply with all of the requirements imposed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of could result in a negative market reaction 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires that we establish and maintain an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting and assess on an on going basis the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting 
our indepen 
table of contents dent registered public accounting firm is required to audit both the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and management s assessment of the design and the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting 
if we do not continue to comply with all of the requirements of section or if our internal controls are not designed or operating effectively  it could result in a negative market reaction 
the design of other core vendors software or their use of financial incentives may make it more difficult for clients to use our complementary products 
currently  some core software vendors design their software so that it is difficult or infeasible to use third party complementary products  including ours 
some core software vendors use financial incentives to encourage their core software clients to purchase their proprietary complementary products 
for example  in the past a core software vendor has charged disproportionately high fees to integrate third party complementary products such as ours  thereby providing a financial incentive for clients of that vendor s core software to use its complementary products 
we have responded to this practice by emphasizing to prospective clients the features and functionality of our products  lowering our price or offering to perform the relevant integration services ourselves 
we cannot assure you that these competitors  or other vendors of core software  will not begin or continue to construct technical  or implement financial  obstacles to the purchase of our products 
these obstacles could make it more difficult for us to sell our complementary products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
operational failures in our outsourcing centers could cause us to lose clients 
damage or destruction that interrupts our provision of outsourcing services could damage our relationship with our clients and may cause us to incur substantial additional expense to repair or replace damaged equipment 
although we have installed back up systems and procedures to prevent or reduce disruption  we cannot assure you that we will not suffer a prolonged interruption of our data processing services 
in the event that an interruption of our network extends for more than several hours  we may experience data loss or a reduction in revenues by reason of such interruption 
in addition  a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could lead our present and potential clients to choose service providers other than us 
unauthorized disclosure of data  whether through breach of our computer systems or otherwise  could expose us to protracted and costly litigation or cause us to lose clients 
in our outsourcing centers  we collect and store sensitive data  including names  addresses  social security numbers  checking and savings account numbers and payment history records  such as account closures and returned checks 
if a person penetrates our network security or otherwise misappropriates sensitive data  we could be subject to liability or our business could be interrupted 
penetration of the network security of our outsourcing centers could have a negative impact on our reputation and could lead our present and potential clients to choose service providers other than us 
we may need additional capital in the future  which may not be available to us  and if we raise additional capital  it may dilute the ownership of existing stockholders 
we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to meet various objectives  such as taking advantage of growth opportunities  including more rapid expansion  acquiring businesses and products  making capital improvements to increase our servicing capacity  developing new services or products  and responding to competitive pressures 

table of contents in addition  we may need additional financing if we decide to undertake new sales and or marketing initiatives  if we are required to defend or enforce our intellectual property rights  or if sales of our products do not meet our expectations 
our existing debt and any debt incurred by us in the future could impair our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures or further acquisitions 
covenants governing any indebtedness we incur would likely restrict our ability to take specific actions  including our ability to pay dividends or distributions on  or redeem or repurchase  our capital stock  enter into transactions with affiliates  merge  consolidate or sell our assets or make capital expenditure investments 
in addition  the use of a substantial portion of the cash generated by our operations to cover debt service obligations and any security interests we grant on our assets could limit our financial and business flexibility 
any additional capital raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities may dilute the ownership of existing stockholders 
furthermore  any additional debt or equity financing we may need may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if future financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to raise additional capital  which could significantly limit our ability to implement our business plan 
in addition  we may have to issue securities  including debt securities  that may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our common stock 
the price of our common stock may be volatile 
in the past three years  technology stocks listed on the nasdaq national market have experienced high levels of volatility and significant declines in value from their historic highs 
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially 
during the period from our initial public offering to december   the closing sale price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market ranged from a low of per share to a high of per share 
the price of the common stock that will prevail in the market depends on many factors  some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance 
the factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include  but are not limited to  the following price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time  significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of financial services companies  actual or anticipated changes in our earnings or fluctuations in our operating results or in the expectations of securities analysts  general economic conditions and trends  major catastrophic events  loss of a significant client or clients  sales of large blocks of our stock  or departures of key personnel 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
due to the potential volatility of our stock price  we may therefore be the target of securities litigation in the future 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources from our business 
if a substantial number of shares of our common stock become available for sale and are sold in a short period of time  the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 
if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly 
the perception in the public market that our stockholders might sell shares of common stock could also depress the market price of our common stock 

table of contents in addition  as of december   options to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock were outstanding under our stock incentive plans  of which  were vested 
a decline in the price of shares of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities  and may cause you to lose part or all of your investment in our shares of common stock 
some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws may deter third parties from acquiring us 
our certificate of incorporation and our by laws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors  including the following our board of directors is classified into three classes  each of which serves for a staggered three year term  only our board of directors  the chairman of our board of directors or our president may call special meetings of our stockholders  our stockholders may take action only at a meeting of our stockholders and not by written consent  we have authorized undesignated preferred stock  the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval  our stockholders have only limited rights to amend our by laws  and we require advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals 
these provisions could discourage  delay or prevent a transaction involving a change of control of our company 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire 
section of the delaware general corporation law may delay  defer or prevent a change of control that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interest 
we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law which  subject to certain exceptions  prohibits business combinations between a publicly held delaware corporation and an interested stockholder  which is generally defined as a stockholder  who becomes a beneficial owner of or more of a delaware corporation s voting stock for a three year period following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder 
section could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of our company that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we transact business with clients almost exclusively in the united states and canada and receive payment for our services exclusively in united states dollars or canadian dollars 
therefore  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks and fluctuations in foreign currencies which could impact our results operations and financial condition 
a increase or decrease in currency exchange rates would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our interest expense is generally not sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states  particularly because a substantial majority of our indebtedness is at fixed rates 
a increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we do not hold derivative financial or commodity instruments and all of our cash and cash equivalents are held on deposit with banks and highly liquid marketable securities with maturities of three months or less
