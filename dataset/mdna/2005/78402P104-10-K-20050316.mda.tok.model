item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of scpie holdings inc and subsidiaries 
certain statements in this report on form k that are not historical in fact constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors based on the company s estimates and expectations concerning future events that may cause the actual results of the company to be materially different from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties  as well as the company s critical accounting policies  are discussed in more detail under business risk factors  management s discussion and analysis overview  and management s discussion and analysis critical accounting policies and in periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission 
overview scpie holdings is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in providing insurance and reinsurance products 
the company is primarily a provider of medical malpractice insurance and related liability insurance products to physicians  healthcare facilities and others engaged in the healthcare industry in california and delaware 
previously  the company had also been actively engaged in the medical malpractice insurance business and related products in other states and the assumed reinsurance business 
during and  the company largely completed its withdrawal from the assumed reinsurance market and medical malpractice insurance outside of california and delaware 
the company s insurance business is organized into two reportable business segments direct healthcare liability insurance and assumed reinsurance operations 
primarily due to significant losses on medical malpractice insurance outside of the state of california and assumed reinsurance business losses arising out of the september  world trade center terrorist attack  the company has incurred losses since the resulting reductions in surplus and corresponding decrease in capital adequacy ratios under both the am best company am best and national association of insurance commissioners naic capital adequacy models required the company to take actions to improve its long term capital adequacy position 
the primary actions taken by the company were to effect an orderly withdrawal from healthcare liability insurance markets outside of california and delaware and from the assumed reinsurance market in its entirety 
at december   the company had only healthcare liability insurance policies remaining in force in these other markets  all of which expired during the first quarter of in december  the company entered into a quota share reinsurance agreement to retrocede to another insurer the majority of reinsurance business written in and during  the company participated in only one ongoing reinsurance syndicate and had no ongoing reinsurance participation in the company continues to settle and pay claims incurred in the non core healthcare and assumed reinsurance operations 
the actions taken by the company have significantly reduced capital requirements related to the premium written to surplus ratio in both the am best and naic capital adequacy models 
the capital requirements associated with the reserve to surplus ratio continue to decline as the company settles the claims in its non core businesses 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related notes 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
premium revenue recognition direct healthcare liability insurance premiums written are earned on a daily pro rata basis over the terms of the policies 
accordingly  unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written which is applicable to the unexpired portion of the policies in force 
reinsurance premiums assumed are estimated based on information provided by ceding companies 
the information used in establishing these estimates is reviewed and subsequent adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are determined 
these premiums are earned over the terms of the related reinsurance contracts 

table of contents loss and loss adjustment expense reserves unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are comprised of case reserves for known claims  incurred but not reported reserves for unknown claims and any potential development for known claims  and reserves for the cost of administration and settlement of both known and unknown claims 
such liabilities are established based on known facts and interpretation of circumstances  including the company s experience with similar cases and historical trends involving claim payment patterns  loss payments and pending levels of unpaid claims  as well as court decisions and economic conditions 
the effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process 
establishing appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process  the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the amount provided 
any increase in the amount of reserves  including reserves for insured events of prior years  could have an adverse effect on the company s results for the period in which the adjustments are made 
the company utilizes both its internal actuarial staff and independent consulting actuaries in establishing its reserves 
the company does not discount its loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
the company had a growing volume of assumed reinsurance between and assumed reinsurance is a line of business with inherent volatility 
ultimate loss experience for the assumed reinsurance operation is based primarily on reports received by the company from the underlying ceding insurers 
many losses take several years to be reported through the system 
the company relies heavily on the ceding entity s estimates of ultimate incurred losses  especially those of lloyd s syndicates 
ceding entities  representing over of the reinsurance assumed business for the to underwriting years based on gross written premiums  submit reports to the company containing ultimate incurred loss estimates reviewed by independent or internal actuaries of the ceding entities 
these reported ultimate incurred losses are the primary basis for the company s reserving estimates 
in other cases  the company relies on its own internal estimates determined primarily by experience to date  individual knowledge of the specific reinsurance contract  industry experience and other actuarial techniques to determine reserve requirements 
because the reserve establishment process is by definition an estimate  actual results will vary from amounts established in earlier periods 
the company recognizes such differences in the periods they are determined 
since reserves accumulate on the balance sheet over several years until all claims are settled  a determination of inadequacy or redundancy could easily have a significant impact on earnings and therefore stockholders equity 
the company has established net reserves of million as of december   after considering both prospective and retrospective reinsurance 
the net reserves including retrospective reserves ceded attributable to the operating segments of the company are as follows summary of loss and lae reserves by segment december  december  december  in millions direct healthcare liability insurance core non core assumed reinsurance segment total net loss and lae reserves ceded loss reserves retrospective reserves ceded loss and lae reserves per balance sheet a difference in the ultimate value of total loss and lae reserves at december   net of reinsurance recoverable  would decrease or increase future pretax earnings by million 
deferred policy acquisition costs deferred policy acquisition costs include commissions  premium taxes and other variable costs incurred in connection with writing business 
deferred policy acquisition costs are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income  including investment income 
if such costs are estimated to be unrecoverable  they are expensed 
recoverability is analyzed based on the company s assumptions related to the underlying policies written  including the lives of the underlying policies  future investment income  and level of expenses necessary to maintain the policies over their entire lives 
deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 

table of contents investments the company considers its fixed maturity and equity securities as available for sale securities 
available for sale securities are sold in response to a number of issues  including the company s liquidity needs  the company s statutory surplus requirements and tax management strategies  among others 
during the fourth quarters of and  the company sold significant amounts of its available for sale securities to increase surplus for statutory accounting purposes 
in late and  the company began to shift the character of its investment income to fully taxable in recognition of the company s current tax position 
available for sale securities are recorded at fair value 
the related unrealized gains and losses  net of income tax effects  are excluded from net income and reported as a component of stockholders equity 
the company evaluates the securities in its available for sale investment portfolio on at least a quarterly basis for declines in market value below cost for the purpose of determining whether these declines represent other than temporary declines 
some of the factors the company considers in the evaluation of its investments are the extent to which the market value of the security is less than its cost basis  the length of time for which the market value of the security has been less than its cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the security s issuer  taking into consideration the economic prospects of the issuers industry and geographical region  to the extent that information is publicly available  and the company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
a decline in the fair value of an available for sale security below cost that is judged to be other than temporary is realized as a loss in the current period and reduces the cost basis of the security 
income taxes at december   the company had million of net deferred income tax assets 
net deferred income tax assets consist of the net temporary differences created as a result of amounts deductible or revenue recognized in periods different for tax return purposes than for accounting purposes 
these deferred income tax assets include an asset of million for a net operating loss carryforward that will expire in a net operating loss carryforward is a tax loss that may be carried forward into future years 
it reduces taxable income in future years and the tax liability that would otherwise be incurred 
the company believes it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized through its future earnings 
as a result  the company has not recorded a valuation allowance 
the company s core operations have historically been profitable on both a gaap and tax basis 
the losses incurred in to have been primarily caused by losses in the non core healthcare and assumed reinsurance businesses 
since the core healthcare liability operation has remained strong and improved over the past years and the non core healthcare liability and assumed operations are now in run off  the company believes it should return to a position of taxable income  thus enabling it to utilize the net operating loss carryforward 
the company s estimate of future taxable income uses the same assumptions and projections as in its internal financial projections 
these projections are subject to uncertainties primarily related to future underwriting results 
if the company s results are not as profitable as expected  the company may be required in future periods to record a valuation allowance for all or a portion of the deferred income tax assets 
any valuation allowance would reduce the company s earnings 
results of operations three year comparison direct healthcare liability insurance background the company has been a leading writer of medical malpractice insurance for physicians and healthcare providers in california for many years 
in  the company began expansion into other professional liability products and into other geographical markets 
the principal product expansion was into professional liability insurance for hospitals 
from through  the company added more than hospitals to its program 
these policies were written through national and regional brokers and covered facilities in four states outside california 
at approximately the same time  the company undertook a major geographic expansion in the physician and small medical group market through an arrangement with brown brown  a leading publicly held insurance broker 
this arrangement commenced in  eventually encompassed nine states and in was expanded to include dentists in two states 
during the same period  the company also expanded into underwriting greater risk nonstandard physicians in a number of states outside california 
the company encountered intense price competition in its hospital expansion efforts 
during  the company incurred unacceptable losses under its hospital policies 
the company experienced adverse loss development in its prior years loss reserves for hospitals and 
table of contents significant ongoing losses in this program 
the company substantially reduced its hospital exposures during through policy nonrenewals and rate increases 
at the beginning of  it insured only hospitals  and this was reduced to hospitals at december   and the last hospital policy expired in december in  and  the company derived approximately  and 
of its healthcare liability earned premium volume  respectively  from policies issued outside the state of california  principally under the brown brown and nonstandard physician programs 
in  the company recognized that these programs were seriously underpriced and implemented significant premium increases  averaging approximately and in and  respectively  in its principal non california markets 
the company also instituted more stringent underwriting and pricing guidelines in these states 
despite the significant price increases and more stringent underwriting guidelines  the non california programs produced significant underwriting losses in  and the company and brown brown agreed in early to terminate both the physician and dental programs no later than march  during  the company continued to issue and renew those policies under the brown brown programs that satisfied the stringent underwriting standards 
the company applied these same standards to the nonstandard physician policies renewed outside california 
as of december   policies were in force related to the brown brown program 
that number was reduced to policies as of december  the company has no active claims made policies in force for the non core healthcare liability insureds as of december  the company remains exposed under extended reporting policies required to be issued upon cancellation or non renewal of the non core insureds 
this exposure is currently reserved and declines over time 
during  the company will continue to concentrate its efforts on its core physician and medical group business in california and delaware and settling outstanding claims in the non core business 
the company does not expect to initiate any significant new programs outside california during assumed reinsurance background the company rapidly expanded its assumed reinsurance operations after the formation of the division in late written premiums were  and million  respectively for  and earned premiums  which lag behind written premiums  were  and million  respectively for  and assumed reinsurance represents the book of assumed worldwide reinsurance of professional  commercial and personal liability coverages  commercial and residential property risks  accident and health and workers compensation coverages and marine coverages 
ultimate loss experience in this segment is based primarily on reports received by the company from the underlying ceding insurers 
actual losses may take several years to be reported through the system 
in  the unprecedented september   terrorist attack materially impacted the results in this segment 
the company identified losses of million  net of reinsurance benefit as of december   and an additional million  million  and million in losses have been recorded in   and  respectively 
as a result of the company s decline in capital and surplus from the world trade center losses and losses incurred in healthcare insurance outside california  a 
m 
best has reduced the insurance subsidiaries ratings below the a excellent rating 
many ceding companies and companies in assumed reinsurance syndicates are reluctant to deal with insurers whose ratings are below a  which made it more difficult for the company to remain in the assumed reinsurance market 
during  the company pursued various financial alternatives to improve its capital position  including a complete or partial divestiture of its assumed reinsurance operations 
in december  the company entered into a quota share reinsurance transaction with rosemont reinsurance ltd 
rosemont re formerly known as goshawk reinsurance limited  a bermuda reinsurance subsidiary of goshawk insurance holdings plc  a publicly held london based lloyd s underwriter goshawk  under which the company ceded to rosemont re almost all of its unearned assumed reinsurance premiums as of june   together with written reinsurance premiums after that date  in each case related to the assumed reinsurance business for the and underwriting years 
the effect of this transaction was to retrocede to rosemont re million of premiums written in  million of premiums written in  and in the company retains certain losses related to the assumed reinsurance business  including those related to the world trade center  and the company continued to participate in one lloyd s syndicate for the underwriting year 
the rosemont re treaty relieved the company of underwriting leverage and improved the company s risk based capital adequacy ratios under both the am best and naic models 
other than net premiums written of million and million from the lloyd s syndicate in and  respectively  the company had no significant premiums written from prior year contracts 
goshawk  the parent of rosemont  suffered serious underwriting losses in late as a result  the company incurred significant losses attributable to its participation in the goshawk underwriting syndicate and a million loss in its holdings of goshawk capital stock 
the losses suffered by goshawk did not materially affect the financial condition of rosemont re

table of contents direct healthcare liability insurance segment the company underwrites professional and related liability policy coverages for physicians including oral and maxillofacial surgeons  physician medical groups and clinics  hospitals  dentists  managed care organizations and other providers in the healthcare industry 
as a result of the company s withdrawal from certain segments of the healthcare industry  the premiums earned are allocated between core and non core premium 
core premium represents california and delaware business excluding the brown brown dental program and hospital business 
non core business represents business related to physician and dental programs formerly conducted for the company primarily in states outside california and delaware by a national independent insurance agency  other state non standard physician programs and hospital programs including those in california 
the following tables summarize by core and non core businesses the underwriting results of the direct healthcare liability insurance segment for the periods indicated direct healthcare liability insurance segment underwriting results in thousands year ended december  core non core total premiums written premiums earned losses and lae incurred underwriting expenses underwriting loss loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio net reserves held year ended december  premiums written premiums earned losses and lae incurred underwriting expenses underwriting loss loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio net reserves held year ended december  premiums written premiums earned losses and lae incurred underwriting expenses underwriting loss loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio net reserves held 
table of contents core business premiums written for the core direct healthcare liability insurance business increased  and  in  and  respectively  as average rate increases of  and in  and  respectively  were partially offset by a decline in the number of insureds 
premiums earned in the core business increased  and in  and  respectively  primarily due to rate increases 
the company has historically had a high renewal rate in its core business 
the renewal rates of insureds who were offered renewal has remained at for  and the company primarily loses insureds due to underwriting actions taken by the company  insureds moving to competitors  leaving their practice  retiring or joining a health facility that provides for their insurance 
these losses are offset by new sales activities 
new policies written in   and were   and  respectively 
the core business policies inforce were  policies   policies and  policies at year end  and  respectively 
the loss ratio losses and lae related to premiums earned for was compared to a loss ratio of and for and  respectively 
the change in loss ratio primarily reflected increases in average claim costs offset by a decline in the frequency of claims  favorable development on prior year reserves and the effect of the average rate increases on earned premiums 
the underwriting expense ratio expenses related to premiums earned remained relatively unchanged at in compared to in the expense ratio increased in compared to  primarily due to additional expenses connected with the rate approval hearing and regulatory triennial audit expenses in excess of amounts previously accrued 
non core business the negative premiums written and earned in represent reinsurance premiums paid by the company in connection with the reinstatement of excess of loss layers for older years 
premiums written decreased in to million from million in this resulted from the significant decline in the number of insureds from  at december   to and insureds at december  and  respectively 
the decline in insureds resulted from the company s actions taken to withdraw from this business 
after march   no new or renewal business was written in the non core programs 
premium earned in the non core direct healthcare liability insurance business decreased as the company withdrew from states other than california and delaware and its hospital program wound down 
the underwriting loss incurred in is primarily due to two adverse litigation decisions  reserve increases attributable to older years on dentists coverage and a general reserve increase of million in the fourth quarter the company made good progress in in settling claims related to the non core healthcare liability business in run off 
total net reserves declined from million at december  to million at december  and outstanding claims fell from at december  to at december  in total only new claims were reported in compared to in as the reserves and cases of non core healthcare claims continue to decline  it becomes more difficult to establish reserve estimates for the remaining claims based on actuarial techniques 
the ultimate losses become more related to specific case results  including litigation rather than estimates based on actuarial techniques 
unexpected legal verdicts or settlements reached at trial can produce unexpected reserve development 
assumed reinsurance segment the following table summarizes the underwriting results of the assumed reinsurance segment for the periods indicated assumed reinsurance segment underwriting results in thousands for the year ended december  premiums written premiums earned underwriting expenses losses underwriting and other operating expenses underwriting loss net reserves held 
table of contents the earned premium in is a result of one ongoing assumed reinsurance program for the underwriting year 
the assumed reinsurance segment premiums written declined in from as the full impact of the retrocession to rosemont re took effect 
premiums written in relate to the one remaining syndicate supported in premiums earned decreased to in  from million in and from million in because of reduction in treaty programs to one account and the cession of premiums written to rosemont re 
the underwriting loss was slightly higher for million versus million 
the underwriting loss in was principally attributable to unexpected adverse loss development during principally in connection with the lloyd s syndicates  additional losses incurred under a single excess of loss directors and officers liability insurance treaty  and losses involving issuers of bail and immigration bonds 
the fall in the us dollar compared to the british pound also contributed to the loss 
the underwriting loss in was principally attributable to the failure of goshawk syndicate and upward development on world trade center losses 
net loss reserves related to the assumed reinsurance segment declined from million at december  to million at december  as reserves were settled and underwriting years for the london syndicates closed and settlements were made in the rosemont re reinsurance treaty entered into in december effectively cedes all of the unearned premium and future reported premium after june   for the assumed business written for underwriting years and by the company million in  million in and million in 
this treaty relieves the company of significant underwriting risk and written premium leverage and significantly improves the company s risk based capital adequacy ratios under both the am best and naic models 
the treaty has no limitations on loss recoveries and includes a profit sharing provision should the combined ratios calculated on the base premium ceded be below 
the treaty requires rosemont re to reimburse the company for its acquisition and administrative expenses 
in addition  the company is required to pay rosemont re additional premium in excess of the base premium ceded of or an estimated million 
the additional premium reduced  and earned premium by  and million  respectively 
the rosemont re reinsurance treaty has both prospective and retroactive elements as defined in financial accounting standards board statement fasb no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts 
as such  any gains under the contract will be deferred and amortized to income based upon the expected recovery 
no gains are anticipated currently 
losses related to future earned premium ceded  as well as development on losses related to existing earned premium ceded after june   will ultimately determine whether a gain will be recorded under the contract 
the retroactive accounting treatment required under fasb requires that a charge to income be recorded to the extent premiums ceded under the contract are in excess of the estimated losses and expenses ceded under the contract 
rosemont re has an a rating from am best and the cession of business to rosemont re is on a funds withheld basis whereby premiums ceded under the contract are kept in trust to collateralize rosemont re s obligations to the company 
other operations december  in thousands net investment income net realized investment gains average invested assets average rate of return before taxes net investment income decreased to million for from million in and million in the decrease in net investment income is primarily related to the decline in average invested assets resulting from lower premiums and loss payments related to the non core healthcare liability and assumed reinsurance businesses 
in addition  the net investment income in was impacted by a lower rate of return after tax on invested assets due to the significant realized gains recognized in the latter half of the lower rate reflected the rates available for reinvestment at the time as the quality of the portfolio was maintained 

table of contents the net realized gains of includes a million write down of the company s goshawk stock investment in the third quarter of the year offset by other gains recognized to increase statutory surplus 
the goshawk stock was sold in early income taxes the company had a minor income tax expense in compared to a benefit of million and million in and  respectively 
during the third quarter  the company settled with the california franchise tax board ftb for million  an assessment received in legislation enacted in california during the third quarter of restored of a deduction provision under which insurance holding companies had for many years deducted all dividends received from their insurance company subsidiaries 
the million settlement is included in income taxes and offsets a federal tax benefit for the year of million 
the company currently has a net deferred tax asset of million as of december   of which million relates to a net operating loss carryforward which expires in the company will be able to utilize this carryforward to reduce taxes in future periods 
the losses in recent years which gave rise to the operating loss carryforward were primarily generated by underwriting losses in the non core direct healthcare liability and assumed reinsurance businesses 
since these operations are now in run off and the core business has historically been profitable on both a gaap and tax basis after consideration of investment income  the company s projections indicate that it is more likely than not that the net operating carryforward will be fully utilized within the carryforward period 
liquidity and capital resources and financial condition the primary sources of the company s liquidity are insurance premiums  net investment income  recoveries from reinsurers and proceeds from the maturity or sale of invested assets 
funds are used to pay losses  lae  operating expenses  reinsurance premiums and taxes 
because of uncertainty related to the timing of the payment of claims  cash from operations for a property and casualty insurance company can vary substantially from period to period 
during  and  the company had negative cash flow from operations of million  million and million  respectively 
the negative cash flow during this period is primarily related to the declining premium receipts and the increasing claims payments associated with the non core physician and assumed reinsurance programs  which are now in run off 
as the company continues to pay off non core healthcare liability and assumed reinsurance reserves generated by prior years written premiums  the company may continue to have negative cash flow from operations 
the company maintains a significant portion of its investment portfolio in high quality  short term securities and cash to meet short term operating liquidity requirements  including the payment of losses and lae 
cash and cash equivalents investments totaled million  or of invested assets  at december  the company believes that all of its short term and fixed maturity securities are readily marketable and have scheduled maturities in line with projected cash needs 
the company invests its cash flow from operations principally in taxable fixed maturity securities 
the company s current policy is to limit its investment in unaffiliated equity securities and mortgage loans to no more than of the total market value of its investments 
the market value of the company s portfolio of unaffiliated equity securities was million at december  compared to million at december  the company plans to continue its emphasis on fixed maturity securities investments for the indefinite future 
the company leases approximately  square feet of office space for its headquarters 
the lease is for a term of years ending in  and the company has two options to renew the lease for a period of five years each 
scpie holdings is an insurance holding company whose assets primarily consist of all of the capital stock of its insurance subsidiaries 
its principal sources of funds are dividends from its subsidiaries and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities 
the insurance subsidiaries are restricted by state regulation in the amount of dividends they can pay in relation to earnings or surplus  without the consent of the applicable state regulatory authority  principally the california department of insurance 
scpie holdings principal insurance company subsidiary  scpie indemnity  may pay dividends to scpie holdings in any month period  without regulatory approval  to the extent such dividends do not exceed the greater of i of its statutory surplus at the end of the preceding year or ii its statutory net income for the preceding year 
applicable regulations further require that an insurer s statutory surplus following a dividend or other distribution be reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs  and permit the payment of dividends only out of statutory earned unassigned surplus unless the payment out of other funds receives regulatory approval 
the amount of dividends that scpie indemnity is able to pay to scpie holdings during without prior regulatory approval is approximately million 
common stock dividends paid to stockholders were per share in these dividends were funded through dividends received from the insurance subsidiaries in prior years 
in march  the board of directors suspended the company s quarterly dividends 
the payment 
table of contents and amount of cash dividends will depend upon  among other factors  the company s operating results  overall financial condition  capital requirements and general business conditions 
as of december   scpie holdings held cash and short terms securities of million of which approximately million was utilized to satisfy the california franchise tax liability in january based on historical trends  market conditions and its business plans  the company believes that its sources of funds including dividends from the insurance subsidiaries will be sufficient to meet the liquidity needs of scpie holdings over the next months 
the company s capital adequacy position has been weakened by the losses in the non core business 
the company s current rating from am best is b fair  with a negative outlook 
am best assigns this rating to companies that have  in its opinion  a fair ability to meet their current obligations to policyholders  but are financially vulnerable to adverse changes in underwriting and economic conditions 
the naic has developed a methodology for measuring the adequacy of an insurer s surplus which includes a risk based capital rbc formula designed to measure state statutory capital and surplus needs 
the rbc rules provide for different levels of regulatory attention based on four thresholds determined under the formula 
at december   the rbc level of each insurance subsidiary exceeded the threshold requiring the least regulatory attention 
at december   scpie indemnity exceeded this threshold by million 
the company believes that it has the ability to fund its continuing operations from its premiums written and investment income 
the company plans to continue its focus on the efficient operation of its core business  while at the same time continuing to adjudicate and settle claims incurred in its discontinued non core business 
as the company continues to run off the non core loss and lae reserves  its capital adequacy position should improve 
contractual commitments the company has certain contractual obligations and commercial commitments principally for providing letters of credit in connection with its assumed reinsurance segment and operating leases for office space for its headquarters and other regional offices 
the table below presents the contractual payments due by period or expiration period for each obligation or commitment contractual commitments as of december   are as follows thereafter payments due by period in thousands operating leases in november  the company arranged a letter of credit facility in the amount of million with barclays bank plc 
letters of credit issued under the facility fulfill the requirements of lloyd s and guarantee loss reserves under reinsurance contracts 
as of december   letter of credit issuance under the facility was approximately million 
securities of million are pledged as collateral under the facility 
effect of inflation the primary effect of inflation on the company is considered in pricing and estimating reserves for unpaid losses and lae for claims in which there is a long period between reporting and settlement  such as medical malpractice claims 
the actual effect of inflation on the company s results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled 
based on actual results to date  the company believes that loss and lae reserve levels and the company s rate making process adequately incorporate the effects of inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to various market risk exposures  including interest rate risk and equity price risk 
the company invests its assets primarily in fixed maturity securities  which at december   comprised of total investments at market value 
corporate bonds represent and us government bonds represent of the fixed maturity investments  with the remainder consisting of mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
equity securities  consisting primarily of common stocks  account for of total investments at market value 
mortgage loans represent of the investment portfolio 
the remainder of the investment portfolio consists of cash and highly liquid short term investments  which are primarily overnight bank repurchase agreements and short term money market funds 
the value of the fixed maturity portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
as market interest rates decrease  the value of the portfolio increases with the opposite holding true in rising interest rate environments 
a common measure of the interest sensitivity of fixed maturity 
table of contents assets is modified or effective duration  a calculation that takes maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms to calculate an average age of the expected cash flows 
the longer the duration  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
the effective duration of the fixed maturity portfolio at december  was years 
the value of the common stock equity investments is dependent upon general conditions in the securities markets and the business and financial performance of the individual companies in the portfolio 
values are typically based on future economic prospects as perceived by investors in the equity markets 
at december   the carrying value of the investment portfolio included million in net unrealized gains 
at december   the investment portfolio included million in net unrealized gains 
the company s invested assets are subject to interest rate risk 
the following table presents the effect on current estimated fair values of the fixed maturity securities available for sale and common stocks assuming a basis point increase in market interest rates and a decline in equity prices 
carrying value estimated fair value at current market rates prices estimated fair value at adjusted market rates prices as indicated below in thousands december  interest rate risk fixed maturity securities available for sale equity price risk common stocks december  interest rate risk fixed maturity securities available for sale equity price risk common stocks adjusted interest rates assume a basis point increase in market rates adjusted equity prices assume a decline in market values for all its financial assets and liabilities  the company seeks to maintain reasonable average durations  consistent with the maximization of income  without sacrificing investment quality and providing for liquidity and diversification 
the estimated fair values at current market rates for financial instruments subject to interest rate risk in the table above are the same as those disclosed in note to consolidated financial statements 
the estimated fair values at the adjusted market rates assuming a basis point increase in market interest rates are calculated using discounted cash flow analysis and duration modeling where appropriate 
the estimated values do not consider the effect that changing interest rates could have on prepayment activity eg  mortgages underlying mortgage backed securities 
this sensitivity analysis provides only a limited  point in time view of the market risk sensitivity of certain of the company s financial instruments 
the actual impact of market interest rate and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis is further limited  as it does not consider any actions the company could take in response to actual and or anticipated changes in interest rates and equity prices
