item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the years ended october   november  and november  overview the company sells substantially all of its photomasks to semiconductor designers and manufacturers 
further  photomask technology is also being applied to the fabrication of higher performance electronic products such as flat panel displays  photonics  micro electronic mechanical systems and certain nanotechnology applications 
thus  the company s selling cycle is tightly interwoven with the development and release of new semiconductor designs and flat panel applications  particularly as it relates to the semiconductor industry s migration to more advanced design methodologies and fabrication processes 
the company believes that the demand for photomasks primarily depends on design activity rather than sales volumes from products produced using photomask technologies 
consequently  an increase in semiconductor sales does not necessarily result in a corresponding increase in photomask sales 
in addition  the reduced use of customized integrated circuits  a reduction in design complexity or other changes in the technology or methods of manufacturing semiconductors or a slowdown in the introduction of new semiconductor designs could reduce demand for photomasks even if demand for semiconductors increases 
further  advances in semiconductor and photomask design and semiconductor production methods could reduce the demand for photomasks 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been volatile  with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns 
these downturns have been characterized by  among other things  diminished product demand  excess production capacity and accelerated erosion of selling prices 
the semiconductor industry had been in a downturn from until the end of  which had a significant impact on the net sales and operating results of a majority of those companies in the industry 
at this time  state of the art for semiconductor masks is considered to be nanometer  while nanometer is in the very early stages of being moved into volume production  and and nanometer constitute the majority of high performance designs being fabricated in volume today 
the company expects there to be a steady increase in nanometer designs moving to wafer fabrication throughout fiscal and believes it is well positioned to service an increasing volume of this business through investments in manufacturing process and technology in the global regions where its customers are located 
in addition to the cyclical downturn previously mentioned  the global semiconductor industry also experienced tremendous difficulties in transitioning from the nanometer process node to the nanometer process node 
the company believes that these technological issues have been addressed  as seen by improving yields and utilization rates in the company s mask fabrication facilities and its customers wafer fabrication facilities 
end markets leading the global semiconductor industry out of the downturn in have been closely tied to consumer driven applications for high performance semiconductor devices  including  but not limited to communications and mobile computing solutions 
the company cannot predict the timing of the industry s transition to volume production of next generation technology nodes or the timing of up and down cycles with precise accuracy  but believes that such transitions and cycles will continue into the future  beneficially and adversely affecting its business  financial condition and operating results in the near term 
the company s ability to remain successful in these environments is based upon achieving its goals of being a service and technology leader  an efficient solutions supplier  and a company able to continually reinvest in its global infrastructure 
the photomask industry has been  and is expected to continue to be  characterized by technological change and evolving industry standards 
in order to remain competitive  the company will be required to continually anticipate  respond to and utilize changing technologies 
in particular  the company believes that  as semiconductor geometries continue to become smaller  it will be required to manufacture complex optically enhanced reticles  including optical proximity correction and phase shift photomasks 
additionally  demand for photomasks has been  and could in the future be adversely affected by changes in methods of semiconductor manufacturing which could affect the type or quantity of photomasks utilized  such as changes in semiconductor demand that favor field programmable gate arrays and other semiconductor designs that replace application specific integrated circuits 
through fiscal  the company has not experienced a significant loss of revenue as a result of alternative semiconductor design methodologies 
additionally  increased market acceptance of alternative methods of transferring circuit designs onto semiconductor wafers  such as direct write lithography  could reduce or eliminate the need for photomasks 
through fiscal  direct write lithography has not been proven to be a commercially viable alternative to photomasks  as it is considered too slow for high volume semiconductor wafer production 
however  should direct write or any other alternative methods of transferring integrated circuit designs to semiconductor wafers be done without the use of photomasks  the company s business and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
if the company is unable to anticipate  respond to  or utilize these or other changing technologies  due to resource  technological or other constraints  its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
both revenues and costs have been affected by the increased demand for high end technology photomasks that require more advanced manufacturing capabilities but generally command higher average selling prices 
to meet the technological demands of its customers and position the company for future growth  the company continues to make substantial investments in high end manufacturing capability both at existing and new facilities 
the company s capital expenditures for new facilities and equipment to support its customers requirements for high technology products was an aggregate of approximately million for the three fiscal years ended october   resulting in significant increases in operating expenses 
based on the anticipated technological changes in the industry  the company expects these trends to continue 
the manufacture of photomasks for use in fabricating integrated circuits and other related products built using comparable photomask based process technologies has been  and continues to be  capital intensive based upon the need to maintain a technology based infrastructure 
the company s integrated global manufacturing network and employees  which consists of nine sites  represent a significant portion of its fixed operating cost base 
should sales volumes decrease based upon the flow of design releases from the company s customers  the company may have excess and underutilized production capacity that could significantly impact operating margins 
currently  the vast majority of photomasks produced for the semiconductor industry employ geometries of nanometers or larger 
at these geometries  the company can produce full lines of photomasks and there is no significant technology employed by the company s competitors that is not available to the company 
recently  a limited amount of semiconductor fabrication has begun utilizing nanometer processes 
the company is currently capable of producing a broad range of photomasks at still smaller geometries  and has begun accelerating its efforts to support the development and production of photomasks for both the nanometer and nanometer technology nodes 
however  as is typical of industries in the midst of technological change  some of the company s competitors may be able to achieve higher manufacturing yields than the company when producing these smaller geometry photomasks  in part because these competitors may have completed more cycles of learning than the company in this area and in part because of the company s need to replicate production of these complex photomasks at its four advanced technology locations world wide 
the company believes that these cases are not material to its business 
results of operations the following table represents selected operating information expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended october  november  november  net sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses consolidation  restructuring and related charges operating income loss interest expense investment and other income  net income loss before income tax provision benefit and minority interest income tax provision benefit minority interest net income loss note all the following tabular comparisons  unless otherwise indicated  are for the fiscal years ended october   november  and november   in millions of dollars 
net sales percent change to to total net sales net sales for the fiscal year ended october  increased to million as compared to million for the fiscal year ended november  the increase is primarily related to increased design releases in as a result of improved end user demand  consumer and corporate  for devices utilizing semiconductor applications 
as a result  the company experienced increased unit demand across all technology nodes during to a lesser extent  the company s overall average selling prices asp s improved in the increased asp s primarily relate to an improved high end mix  which is defined as revenue at nanometer and below design rules  and increased sales of large area masks which typically have higher asp s 
by geographic area  sales increased by million in asia and million in europe  while sales in north america decreased by million 
net sales for the fiscal year ended november   decreased as compared to million for the fiscal year ended november  the decrease was attributable to a slow down in new design releases  due in part  to decreased end user demand  both consumer and corporate  for devices utilizing semiconductors and continued increased competitive pricing pressures for mature technology products 
during  the company experienced an overall decline in average selling prices and unit volumes as a result of the competitive pricing pressures for mature technology products and a decrease in new design releases 
additionally  in  the company continued to experience a reduction in sales in north america  due in part to the continued migration of semiconductor manufacturing to asian foundries by certain north american customers 
by geographic area  net sales in asia increased million or  while north america sales decreased million or and european sales decreased million or 
gross margin percent change to to gross margin gross margin during and the company was impacted by a severe and prolonged downturn in the semiconductor industry  which resulted in decreased demand  excess capacity and increased competitive pricing pressures 
the company also began to experience increased growth in asia during this time  while north america sales began to decline 
to mitigate the decline in its business  which has impacted its gross margins  in august the company reduced its operating cost structure by closing its milpitas  california facility 
in march  the company began to further restructure its operations in north america by closing its phoenix  arizona facility and reducing its global work force 
the company s gross margin  which is net sales less cost of goods sold  improved to in as compared to in fiscal this improvement was a result of improved utilization of the company s manufacturing network and improved high end product mix as well as stabilization of pricing for mature products 
the company operates in a high fixed cost environment and to the extent that the company s revenues and utilization increase or decrease  gross margin will generally be positively or negatively impacted 
the gross margin percentage in could be negatively impacted by increased depreciation expense associated with the company s and capital expenditures for additional tool sets and corresponding infrastructure for advanced technologies 
gross margin for the fiscal year ended november  decreased to as compared to for the fiscal year ended november  the decrease was primarily associated with decreased sales volume  which decreased the utilization of the company s fixed equipment cost base  due in part to lower than anticipated demand for high end technology products which have design rules of micron and below  and competitive pricing pressures for mature product technologies resulting in lower asp s 
selling  general and administrative expenses percent change to to s  g a expense to net sales selling  general and administrative expenses decreased for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to november  by million 
this decrease is primarily attributable to the full year impact of reduced salaries and wages and selling expenses in north america associated with the company s north american consolidation initiatives coupled with ongoing cost reduction activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended november  decreased to million as compared to november  this decrease was primarily attributable to reduced salary and wages and facility costs in north america as a result of the company s march north american consolidation initiatives 
research and development percent change to to r d expense to net sales research and development expenditures consist primarily of global development efforts of high end process technologies for advanced sub wavelength reticle solutions at and below nanometers 
research and development expenses increased to million for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to the fiscal year ended november  in fiscal  research and development expenditures were million as compared to million in consolidation  restructuring and related charges since  the company closed four manufacturing facilities in north america and one in europe due in part to the migration of semiconductor manufacturing to asia and excess capacity associated with decreased demand 
the decision to close facilities in north america corresponded to the decreased north american sales volume 
the company s north american net sales declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and to million in fiscal the decline in sales in north america from to resulted in increased north america operating losses during and the decline in sales volume and operating profits in north america was attributable to the company s customers migrating their business to lower cost foundries  primarily located in asia 
this created excess capacity in the united states 
competitive pricing pressures and weakened demand further eroded the company s north american operating results 
in march of  the company initiated a plan to close its phoenix  arizona manufacturing facility and further consolidate its north american manufacturing network in order to increase capacity utilization and manufacturing efficiencies 
total consolidation and related charges of million were recorded during the second quarter of fiscal components of the charge include million for workforce reduction of approximately employees in the united states  million for facility lease payments  and million of non cash charges for the impairment in carrying value of fixed assets 
the majority of the photomasks produced at the company s phoenix  arizona facility were cross qualified with other united states manufacturing sites 
consequently  the decision to close the phoenix  arizona facility had minimal impact on united states production or customer service 
in august  the company implemented a plan to reduce its operating cost structure by reducing its work force in the united states by approximately employees and by ceasing the manufacture of photomasks at its milpitas  california facility 
total consolidation and related charges of million were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal of the total charge  million was non cash for the impairment in carrying value of fixed assets  million of cash charges for severance and benefits for terminated employees that were paid during their entitlement periods and million of cash charges for facilities closing costs as well as lease termination costs 
the following tables in millions set forth the company s restructuring reserves as of october   november  and november  and reflects the activities affecting the reserves for years then ended year ended october  november  october  balance charges credits balance manufacturing capacity reduction and other workforce reductions total year ended november  november  november  balance charges credits balance manufacturing capacity reduction and other workforce reductions total year ended november  october  november  balance charges credits balance manufacturing capacity reduction and other workforce reductions total as of october   manufacturing capacity reduction and other of million primarily represents non cancelable lease obligations that will be paid over the respective lease terms through other income expense interest expense investment and other income  net total other income expense interest expense decreased million to million for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to the fiscal year ended november  the decrease in interest expense is a result of reduced debt associated with the company s redemption of million of the company s outstanding convertible subordinated notes in june and the aggregate redemption of million during of the convertible subordinated notes 
investment and other income  net  decreased by million in primarily due to reduced investment gains 
interest expense for the fiscal year ended november  decreased by million to million as compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of reduced overall effective borrowing rates  partially offset by increased borrowings 
investment and other income  net  during fiscal decreased to million as compared to million in fiscal primarily due to a million gain on the repurchase of million of the company s convertible subordinated notes in income taxes the company s operations have followed the recent migration of semiconductor industry fabrication to asia  where the company operates in countries where it is accorded favorable tax treatments 
the company has been granted tax holidays in taiwan and singapore  which expire in and  respectively 
in korea  various investment tax credits have been utilized to reduce the company s effective income tax rate 
the provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended october  was million or of pretax income  which differs from the federal statutory rate of as a result of tax holidays in taiwan and singapore  available tax credits in korea and valuation reserves on losses generated in the united states 
the provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended november  was million on a pre tax loss of million 
the provision differs from the federal statutory rate of a benefit as a result of the company s inability to record additional deferred tax benefits for net operating losses in the united states 
other factors contributing to the effective tax rate in include income from geographic regions for which the company has tax holidays and available tax credits  including taiwan and korea 
the availability of tax holidays in some asian jurisdictions did not have a significant impact in the company s decision to close some of its north american facilities nor in the company s increased asian presence which is in response to fundamental changes taking place in the semiconductor industry that the company serves 
as semiconductor fabrication has migrated to asia  in large part from the united states  the company has followed  in order to avoid a severe loss of business 
on october   the american jobs creation act ajca was signed into law 
the ajca includes a deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the ajca 
the company may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in fiscal the company has started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision  however  the company does not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until after congress or the treasury department provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision 
the company expects to complete its evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision within a reasonable period of time following the publication of the additional clarifying language 
the range of possible amounts that the company is considering for repatriation under this provision is between zero and million 
the related potential range of income tax effects is estimated to be between zero and million taking into account the company s tax attributes 
minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries minority interest charges were million for the fiscal year ended october  and million for the fiscal year ended november   and reflect the minority interest in earnings of the company s non wholly owned subsidiaries located in taiwan and korea 
the company s ownership as of october  in each subsidiary was for korea and for taiwan 
the million increase for over is a result of increased earnings of both locations in in december  the company increased its ownership to approximately of pkl with the acquisition of additional shares of pkl for cash of approximately million 
minority interest charges were million for the fiscal year ended november  and million for the fiscal year ended november   and reflected the minority interest in earnings of the company s non wholly owned subsidiaries located in taiwan and korea 
the decrease in minority interest charge compared to the prior year was due to the company s ownership interest in pkl increasing by in april liquidity and capital resources on april   the company sold million of its convertible subordinated notes due in a private offering pursuant to rule a under the securities act of these notes are convertible into the company s common stock at a conversion price of per share 
net proceeds from the issuance amounted to approximately million 
on june   a portion of the net proceeds was used to redeem all million of the company s outstanding convertible subordinated notes 
pursuant to the terms of the related indenture  the convertible subordinated notes were redeemed at of the principal amount plus accrued interest of million for an aggregate redemption price of million  including a premium of million 
an early extinguishment charge of million was incurred on the redemption of the convertible subordinated notes 
this charge included the aforementioned million premium and million of unamortized deferred financing costs which were expensed at the time of redemption 
the company has a credit agreement that expires in july  with a group of financial institutions that provides for a revolving credit facility with an aggregate commitment of million 
the credit facility allows for borrowings in various currencies with an interest rate that is based on the terms of the agreement and will vary based on currencies borrowed and market conditions 
during most of  the company had borrowed million in korean won denominated borrowings under the facility  which had an effective interest rate of approximately 
the company repaid all of its outstanding borrowings million in korean won under the million credit facility in october and has no outstanding borrowings as of october  the facility fee is of the total aggregate commitment 
the credit facility agreement contains various financial and other covenants  including  but not limited to defined maximum ratio of senior funded debt to ebitda most restrictive covenant  minimum ebitda to interest expense  minimum consolidated net worth and cash balances  limitation on cash dividends available for payment to shareholders and annual capital expenditures 
as of october   million was available under the facility 
on september   the credit facility was amended to increase the limit on the company s annual capital expenditures  and to allow for the company s redemption of a portion of its outstanding convertible notes 
the company s working capital decreased to million at october  as compared to million at november  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at october  as compared to million at november  during  the company financed the million reduction of its outstanding debt through its operating income and cash balances 
cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended october  increased to million from million for the fiscal year ended november  the increase relates to the net income generated in as compared to a net loss in and increased accruals at october  relating to the timing on certain payments for capital equipment 
for the fiscal year ended november   cash from operating activities decreased to million from million for the fiscal year ended november   due in part to the increased net loss in fiscal and payments for certain capital equipment which was accrued for at november  cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended october  was million  which consisted principally of capital equipment purchases of million and a net decrease in short term investments of million 
cash used in investing activities of million in fiscal consisted primarily of capital equipment purchases 
capital expenditures for the fiscal years ended   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the company expects capital expenditures for fiscal to be approximately million to million 
capital expenditures for fiscal will be used primarily to continue to expand the company s high end technical capability 
cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended october  of million consisted principally of the convertible subordinated notes redemptions 
during the fiscal year ended october   the company redeemed million of its convertible notes for million and paid down million of other debt 
cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal consisted principally of the proceeds from the issuance of the company s convertible subordinated notes of million offset by the redemption of the company s convertible subordinated notes and other net debt repayments of million 
the company believes that its currently available resources  together with its capacity for growth and its accessibility to debt and equity financing sources  are sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
on november   the company redeemed an additional million of its subordinated convertible notes resulting in an outstanding principal balance of million at that date 
as part of the early extinguishment  the company incurred a charge of million for the premium on the notes and the write off of deferred financing fees 
the company s commitments represent investments in additional manufacturing capacity as well as advanced equipment for the production of high end  more complex photomasks 
at october   the company had commitments outstanding for capital expenditures of approximately million 
additional commitments for capital requirements are expected to be incurred during fiscal cash requirements the company s cash requirements over the next months will be primarily to fund operations  including spending on research and development  capital expenditures and debt service  as well as any cash acquisitions that it may undertake 
the company expects that cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the next months 
however  the company cannot assure that additional sources of financing would be available to the company on commercially favorable terms should the company s capital requirements exceed cash available from operations and existing cash and short term investments 
the company regularly reviews the availability and terms on which it might issue additional equity or debt securities in the public or private markets 
contractual cash obligations the following table quantifies the company s future contractual obligations as of october  in millions payments due total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total certain transactions the chairman of the board of the company is also the chairman of the board and majority shareholder of a company who is a supplier of secure managed information technology services

the company purchased million and million of photomask blanks from this company in and  respectively  for which the amount owed to this company was million at october  and million at november   respectively 
the company believes that the terms of the transactions described above with affiliated persons were negotiated at arm s length and were no less favorable to the company than the company could have obtained from non affiliated parties 
application of critical accounting procedures the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company s accounting policies that affect its financial condition and results of operations 
estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in them 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company s estimates are based on the facts and circumstances available at the time  different reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period  and changes in the accounting estimates used are likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
actual results reported by the company may differ from such estimates 
the company reviews these estimates periodically and reflects the effect of revisions in the period that they are determined 
derivative instruments and hedging activities the company records derivatives in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are reported in the consolidated statements of operations or as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of shareholders equity  depending on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  the derivative must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged items during the term of the hedge 
the company uses judgment in assessing the fair value of derivatives and related financial instruments including assumptions utilized in derivative fair value models in such areas as projected interest rates and changes in the company s stock price during the contract term 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
repairs and maintenance as well as renewals and replacements of a routine nature are charged to operations as incurred  while those which improve or extend the lives of existing assets are capitalized 
upon sale or other disposition  the cost of the asset and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts  and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations 
depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
buildings and improvements are depreciated over to years  machinery and equipment over to years and furniture  fixtures and office equipment over to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement  whichever is less 
judgment and assumptions are used in establishing estimated useful lives and depreciation periods 
the company also uses judgment and assumptions as it periodically reviews property  plant and equipment for any potential impairment in carrying values whenever events such as a significant industry downturn  plant closures  technological obsolescence or other changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
actual fair values may differ from estimated fair values 
intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles  and software development costs 
these assets are stated at fair value as of the date acquired less accumulated amortization 
amortization is calculated on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of years for software development costs and  prior to november   to years for goodwill and acquisition related assets 
as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized  but the future economic benefit of the carrying value of all intangible assets is reviewed annually and the company uses judgment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an intangible asset may not be recoverable based on discounted cash flows or market factors and an impairment loss would be recorded in the period so determined 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on the company s judgment and estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
income taxes the income tax provision benefit is computed on the basis of consolidated financial statement income or loss before income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
in the event the company determines that future taxable income is not expected to be sufficient  the company uses judgment and assumptions to determine if valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets are required by considering future market growth  forecasted operations  future taxable income  and the mix of earnings in the tax jurisdictions in which it operates in order to determine the need for a valuation allowance 
the company considers income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it operates in order to determine its effective income tax rate 
current income tax exposure is identified along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the actual annual amount of taxable income in each tax jurisdiction may differ from the estimates used to compute the effective income tax rate during the first  second and third quarters 
additionally  the company evaluates the recoverability of deferred income tax assets from future taxable income and establishes valuation allowances if recovery is deemed not likely 
accordingly  the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations is impacted by changes in the valuation allowance 
significant management estimates and judgment are required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when both title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
the company makes estimates and assumptions and uses judgment relating to discounts and estimates for product return and warranties  which are accrued and recognized at the time of sale 
discounts sales discounts are negotiated with customers prior to billing and at the time of billing  sales invoices are prepared net of negotiated sales discounts 
product returns customer returns have historically been insignificant 
however  the company does record a liability for the insignificant amount of estimated sales returns based upon historical experience 
warranties and other post shipment obligations for a day period  the company warrants that items sold will conform to customer specification 
however  the company s liability is limited to repair or replacement of the photomasks at its sole option 
the company inspects photomasks for conformity to customer specifications prior to shipment 
accordingly  customer returns of items under warranty have historically been insignificant 
however  the company records a liability for the insignificant amount of estimated warranty returns based on historical experience 
the company s specific return policies include accepting returns for products with defects  or products that have not been produced to precise customer specifications 
at the time of shipment  a liability is established for these items 
customer acceptance customer acceptance occurs concurrently with the transfer of title and risk of loss based upon the applicable shipping and delivery terms 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company is required to use considerable judgment in estimating the collectibility of its accounts receivable 
this estimate is based on a variety of factors  including the length of time receivables are past due  macroeconomic conditions  significant one time events  and historical experience

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company records derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are reported in the statement of operations or as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of shareholders equity  depending on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  the derivative must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged items during the term of the hedge 
in general  the types of risks hedged are those relating to the variability of future cash flows caused by movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company documents its risk management strategy and hedge effectiveness at the inception of and during the term of each hedge 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company entered into an interest rate swap contract  which effectively converted million of its fixed rate convertible subordinated notes to a variable rate 
contract payments are made on a libor based variable rate at october  and are received at the fixed rate 
the interest rate swap contract is used to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to fixed interest rates
