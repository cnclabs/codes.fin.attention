item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following management s discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and the financial condition of the company 
management s discussion and analysis is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  the company s financial statements and accompanying notes to the financial statements 
the company s results continue to be highly correlated to the direction of the equity markets and are subject to volatility due to changes in interest rates  valuation of financial instruments  economic and political trends and industry competition 
an environment favorable to the company s success is characterized by a stable political environment  low inflation  low unemployment  upward trending financial markets  and strong business profitability which lead to investor confidence 
during  long term inflation expectations remained low and the federal reserve continued its measured and consecutive short term interest rate increases 
the dow jones industrial average  s p and nasdaq indices rose  and  respectively  during the fiscal year 
the average monthly volume of shares traded increased over the prior year on both the nyse and nasdaq 
corporate earnings have also been generally much stronger than expected  with earnings growth generally in double digits over the prior year 
these factors had a positive impact on the levels of equity underwritings and merger and acquisition activity leading to strong results in the capital markets segment 
the impact of higher trading volumes and improved investor confidence is reflected in the increase in both the private client group and capital markets securities commissions 
results of operations total company the company currently operates through the following seven business segments private client group  capital markets  asset management  rjbank  emerging markets  stock loan borrow and various corporate investments and expenses combined in the other segment 
the other segment previously consisted of what is now three segments emerging markets  stock loan borrow  and other 
reclassifications have been made in the segment disclosures for fiscal years and to conform to the current year presentation 
the following table presents consolidated and segment financial information for the company for the years indicated year ended september  september  september  in s total company revenues pretax earnings private client group revenues pretax earnings capital markets revenues pretax earnings asset management revenues pretax earnings rjbank revenues pretax earnings emerging markets revenues pretax earnings stock loan stock borrow revenues pretax earnings other revenues pretax earnings loss year ended september  compared with the year ended september  total company the company had record results for its fiscal year ended september   with both total and net revenues surpassing billion for the first time in the company s history 
net income of over million was up from the prior year 
driven by robust increases in investment banking revenues and net interest earnings see table below combined with solid increases in investment advisory fees and securities commissions and fees  all three of the company s largest segments had significantly higher revenues than in the prior year 
capital markets and asset management had even more impressive increases in pretax profits and  respectively 
private client group earnings were negatively impacted by legal expenses and settlements 
total firm net revenues increased  while pre tax  pre minority interest profits were up over the prior year 
pre tax profits after consideration of minority interest were up over the prior year 
year ended september  compared with the year ended september  total company total revenues increased to a record billion  as each of the company s three largest segments contributed to the growth 
net revenues rose  as interest expense grew only 
scattered throughout several segments  net interest earnings continue to be an important source of profits to the company see the table below 
significantly  the upward trend of the equity markets during most of fiscal led many individual investors to return to the market  which in turn led to a steady rise in margin debits throughout the year 
these balances are the company s best interest spread product  as the risk is well controlled and they are funded by relatively low cost client funds awaiting investment 
margin loan growth is largely responsible for the overall improvement in net interest income

the federal reserve raised short term rates by basis points eight times during fiscal rising rates contribute to the company s net interest earnings by increasing spreads earned on cash balances of brokerage clients  at raymond james bank  and in the securities lending operation 
further  higher rates were earned on the portion of the company s capital that is invested in interest bearing instruments

due to the continued process of upgrading the company s financial advisor population  which encompassed the termination of lower producers  the net increase in the number of financial advisors was only 
the company s branding campaign  which has increased the visibility of the firm name  and the promotion of the advisorchoice platform for financial advisors has helped to increase financial advisor interest in the company 
in particular  the employee firm rja had strong recruiting results in the latter half of the year as the company benefited from industry consolidation 
most of the increase in commission and fee revenue is attributable to the increased average production of financial advisors and was close to the company s goal of a increase per year 
further productivity gains may be expected  provided the market conditions remain favorable  as newly recruited financial advisors complete the transition of their accounts and existing financial advisors grow their businesses 
while average margin balances increased for the fiscal year  interest revenues within pcg increased as a result of rising short term interest rates  which also led to higher than normal spreads 
accordingly  pcg net interest earnings increased  and represented nearly of this segment s earnings 
commission expense grew ratably with commission and fee revenue 
increased administrative compensation costs include cost of living raises  a increase in employee headcount and increased incentive compensation and benefit plan accruals related to increased corporate profitability 
communications and information processing expense increased as the company continues its efforts to provide state of the art technology to its financial advisors 
business development expense includes the marketing expenditures to promote the advisorchoice platform to prospective financial advisors and the company s branding efforts including a new television ad and increased air time 
these efforts  combined with the stadium naming rights for the tampa bay buccaneers football stadium  have increased the company s name recognition nationwide 
business development expense also includes increased travel expenses related to recruiting efforts and increased attendance at sales and education conferences 
other expense continues to be dominated by legal expenses and settlements 
pcg margins  which were in fiscal  were negatively impacted by the losses in the early stage  independent contractor joint venture in the uk  relatively low margins in the private client group in rj ltd as they grow their independent contractor division and historically high legal costs and settlements  which has had an estimated to impact on pcg margins in each of the past two years 
year ended september  compared with the year ended september  private client group the increase in pcg commission revenues was attributable to the combination of several factors 
first  there was a modest net increase in financial advisor headcount of  or  to  in the company s wholly owned subsidiaries 
more importantly  the process of upgrading the sales force by releasing lower producers continued in earnest 
thus  the overall composition of the sales force was improved from the prior year 
finally  there were months of strong market activity during as compared to approximately six strong months in the aforementioned improved quality of the sales force amplified the effect on revenues of the longer duration of good market conditions 
the improved interest spread was due to the steady rise in margin debits throughout the year 
the increase in financial service fees was a result of the increased number of transaction fees from trades in fee based accounts and a higher amount of ira fees as the number of such accounts grew 
other revenues increased due to higher mutual fund networking fees and greater meeting sponsorship revenues 
administrative compensation costs reflect increased home office staffing in the domestic independent contractor subsidiary and higher incentive compensation accruals as profits were significantly improved 
business development expenses rose due primarily to the cost of promoting the advisorchoice platform 
most notably  other expenses  including legal expenses and reserves  declined by one third from the prior year 
as is the case in all of the company s major businesses  there is significant operating leverage in the pcg  particularly with increases in financial advisor average production 
accordingly  the increase in net revenues led to a surge in pretax income of

although the number of managed co managed corporate underwritings was nearly flat  underwriting fees were up as a result of an increased average deal size and a greater number of lead managed deals 
merger and acquisition fees nearly doubled from fiscal equity capital markets has nine strategic business units  real estate  energy and healthcare were the strongest performers during fiscal these record investment banking results contribute significantly to the firm s profits  as incremental revenues produce a high margin 
rjtcf revenues were up and contributed million to the segment s pretax profits 
rjtcf syndicates real estate partnerships that qualify for federal and state low income housing tax credits 
during fiscal  rjtcf invested over million for institutional investors in real estate transactions compared to million in deals in fiscal interest expense  the expense associated with carrying the fixed income trading inventory  was up due to increased interest rates 
non interest expense was up with of that increase related to compensation 
the remaining expenses were relatively flat 
year ended september  compared with the year ended september  capital markets despite a significant decline in fixed income sales volume  the unprecedented activity levels of the equity capital markets operations propelled this segment to record revenues and profits 
most notably  the company was lead or co manager for public offerings for the year  nearly double the number in  as market conditions were conducive for several of the industries on which these efforts are focused 
this deal flow was a major contributing factor to the increase in institutional equity sales commissions 
the decline in fixed income commissions reflects investors hesitancy to commit funds while anticipating a rising interest rate environment 
the rise in interest expense represents the financing costs of the higher average fixed income inventory balances 
commission expense was nearly flat despite the rise in commission revenues as fixed income commissions carry a higher payout than equities 
the increase in administrative expense is primarily attributable to higher profit based incentive compensation in equity capital markets departments 
the operating leverage in this segment was dramatic as the average production of institutional equity salesmen  sales traders and investment bankers rose sharply 
as a result  record profits of million were higher than in the prior year

assets under management in s eagle asset mgmt  inc retail institutional total eagle heritage family of mutual funds money market other total heritage raymond james consulting services awad asset management freedom accounts total assets under management less assets managed for affiliated entities third party assets under management year ended september  compared with the year ended september  asset management investment advisory fees increased roughly 
due to the billing schedules this increase does not correlate directly to the increase in average assets under management 
approximately one half of the company s assets under management are billed based on beginning of quarter balances and slightly less than one third are billed based on average daily balances 
the remaining assets under management are predominantly billed based on end of quarter balances 
the overall growth of managed equity programs was the aggregate result of strong net sales and market appreciation 
eagle asset management has several portfolio managers with strong performance records and the firm has been successful in winning a growing number of institutional accounts 
accordingly  assets managed for institutional accounts increased over the prior year 
several of the same portfolio managers also manage portfolios for the heritage asset management mutual fund family 
assets in these funds  excluding the money market funds  increased over the prior year 
in addition to eagle portfolio managers  the asset management division of rja offers independent investment advisors to the company s clients through its raymond james consulting services program 
assets managed within this program have increased over the prior year 
the company has also seen significant growth in its managed mutual fund product freedom as this concept is extremely popular with financial advisors and clients 
expense growth in this segment was a modest  primarily reflecting increased personnel costs related to profit based incentive compensation and increased business development expenses related to increased travel and proposal costs 
other expense is predominantly fees paid to outside money managers 
with the capacity to increase assets under management significantly in certain disciplines without significant additional costs  there is a higher degree of leverage in this segment and management has a positive outlook on its prospects  provided market conditions do not deteriorate and performance results remain strong 
year ended september  compared with the year ended september  asset management investment advisory fees rose at a rate higher than that of assets under management primarily because the increase in assets consisted entirely of equity accounts  which bear a higher management fee than fixed income and money market assets 
in addition  the company earned approximately  more in performance fees from managed hedge funds than in the prior year 
money market fund balances were the only category that declined  as investors gained confidence in the equity markets and shifted some of these funds accordingly 
the increase in administrative expense relates primarily to performance based and profit based incentive compensation accruals 
once again  operating leverage was evident as a modest increase in revenues led to significant rise in pretax income

in s interest income and expense interest income interest expense net interest income other income net revenues non interest expense employee compensation and benefits communications and information processing occupancy and equipment other total non interest expense pretax earnings year ended september  compared with the year ended september  rjbank interest revenue and expense increased due to the combination of balance sheet growth and rising interest rates during the year 
as a result  net interest income increased to million for fiscal vs 
million in fiscal the increase in loans receivable was predominantly in purchased residential mortgage loan pools  and therefore did not require significant increases in costs  with total non interest expense actually declining 
this decrease is primarily the net impact of a decline in the provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is directly correlated to the net increase in loans outstanding and the mix of such loans 
rj bank has become  and is expected to grow into  a more significant segment within the company during the next several years 
rjf contributed an additional million in equity capital to rj bank in fiscal allowing rj bank to begin to grow its asset base in preparation for offering an improved deposit alternative for certain brokerage accounts 
the company currently offers customers the option of sweeping their cash awaiting investment to the heritage cash trust the money market fund managed by heritage asset management or leaving the cash in the broker dealer in the client interest program 
rjbank anticipates offering customers a competitive option beginning in late fiscal the clients will receive an equivalent money market interest rate in the bank account and their accounts will have fdic insurance 
this program is not expected to have a significant impact on the results of operations in fiscal year ended september  compared with the year ended september  rjbank the improvement in net interest income was a result of further progress in loan growth as a percentage of total assets 
the decline in other income reflects the slowdown of refinancing activity  which led to fewer mortgage originations and lower fees from the subsequent sales of originated fixed rate loans 
the increase in other expense encompasses a higher provision for loan losses due to the increased levels of purchased whole loan pools and outstanding commercial loan balances 
rjbank s policy is to maintain a substantially duration matched portfolio of assets and liabilities 
as the vast majority of liabilities are floating rate demand deposits  certain asset purchases are hedged through entering into interest rate swap contracts 
interest spreads have been negatively impacted by the effect of interest rate swaps which were put in place several years ago to hedge fixed rate assets against interest rate increases  substantially all of these contracts expire by the end of calendar the combination of the factors discussed above resulted in a decline in pretax income 
as mentioned in previous years  current results are negatively impacted during periods of significant net loan growth as a provision for loan losses is recorded in the period of origination or purchase  while the benefit of the higher interest earnings is recognized over subsequent periods

year ended september  compared with the year ended september  emerging markets  stock loan borrow  and other net interest income improved as securities lending balances were much higher than in the prior year and the balance of free cash was also higher  enough so that the parent company s term loan million balance at payoff was repaid in august  more than a year ahead of maturity 
other income reflects the improved performance of the company s consolidated joint ventures in emerging markets  particularly in turkey 
statement of financial condition analysis the company s statement of financial condition consists primarily of cash and cash equivalents a large portion of which are segregated for customers  receivables and payables 
the statement of financial condition is primarily liquid in nature  providing the company with flexibility in financing its business 
total assets of billion at september  were up over september  this increase is made up of increases in cash  receivables from brokerage and bank clients and an increase in the assets held by consolidated variable interest entities vies net of a decline in stock borrowed balances 
the assets of the consolidated vies include cash  other receivables and investments in real estate partnerships 
total liabilities have increased since the prior fiscal year end 
this increase is made up of increased payables to brokerage and bank clients  and an increase in the loans payable of the consolidated vies net of the decrease in stock loaned 
the gross assets and liabilities of the consolidated vies are expected to increase as the tax credit fund business grows and establishes additional multi investor funds 
this growth is expected to have a minimal net impact on the company 
the broker dealer gross assets and liabilities  including stock loan stock borrow  receivables and payables from to brokers  dealers and clearing organizations and clients fluctuate with the company s business levels and overall market conditions 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was approximately million 
cash was provided by earnings and increased brokerage client cash balances 
this increase in cash was offset by increased receivables from clients arising from normal cash and margin transactions and fees receivable 
cash was also impacted by investments in real estate partnerships held by variable interest entities 
since the company s ownership interest in these variable interest entities range from 
to  the net cash impact was offset by the change in minority interest 
the remainder of the cash used is attributed to the net fluctuations in various other asset and liability accounts 
investing activities used million in cash  which is primarily due to loans originated and purchased by rjbank  the purchases of available for sale securities  and capital expenditures  net of loan repayments and the maturation and repayments of available for sale securities

rjbank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require rjbank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier i capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined

critical accounting policies the company s financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the following is a summary of the company s critical accounting policies 
for a full description of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  those described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
these critical accounting policies require estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements 
due to their nature  estimates involve judgments based upon available information 
actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
therefore  understanding these policies is important in understanding the reported results of operations and the financial position of the company

the company also has an outstanding leveraged lease with continental valued at million as of sept 
 the company s equity investment represented of the aggregate purchase price  the remaining was funded by public debt issued in the form of equipment trust certificates 
the residual value of the aircraft at the end of the lease term of approximately years is projected to be of the original cost 
this lease expires in september although continental remains current on its lease payments to the company  the inability of continental to make its lease payments  or the termination of the lease through a bankruptcy proceeding  could result in the write down of the company s investment and the acceleration of certain income tax payments 
given the difficult economic environment for the airline industry  the company is closely monitoring this investment for specific events or circumstances that would allow reasonable estimation of any potential impairment 
goodwill intangible assets consist predominantly of goodwill related to the acquisitions of roney co 
now part of rja and goepel mcdermid  inc now called raymond james ltd 
this goodwill  totaling million  was allocated to the reporting units within the private client group and capital markets segments pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized 
the company reviews its goodwill in order to determine whether its value is impaired on at least an annual basis 
goodwill is impaired when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit 
when available  the company uses recent  comparable transactions to estimate the fair value of the respective reporting units 
the company calculates an estimated fair value based on multiples of revenues  earnings  and book value of comparable transactions 
however  when such comparable transactions are not available or have become outdated  the company uses discounted cash flow scenarios to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
as of september   goodwill had been allocated to the private client group of rja  and both the private client group and capital markets segments of rj ltd 
as of the most recent impairment test  the company determined that the carrying value of the goodwill for each reporting unit had not been impaired 
however  changes in current circumstances or business conditions could result in an impairment of goodwill 
as required  the company will continue to perform impairment testing on an annual basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
reserves the company recognizes liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure that  when fully analyzed  indicates it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
when a range of probable loss can be estimated  the company accrues the most likely amount  if not determinable  the company accrues at least the minimum of the range of probable loss 
the company records reserves related to legal proceedings in other payables 
such reserves are established and maintained in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and financial interpretation no 
the determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management 
management considers many factors including  but not limited to the amount of the claim  the amount of the loss in the client s account  the basis and validity of the claim  the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of an employee of the company  previous results in similar cases  and legal precedents and case law 
each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management 
lastly  each case is reviewed to determine if it is probable that insurance coverage will apply  in which case the reserve is reduced accordingly 
any change in the reserve amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as a charge credit to earnings in that period 
the company also records reserves or allowances for doubtful accounts related to client receivables and loans 
client receivables at the broker dealers are generally collateralized by securities owned by the brokerage clients 
therefore  when a receivable is considered to be impaired  the amount of the impairment is generally measured based on the fair value of the securities acting as collateral  which is measured based on current prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker dealer price quotations 
client loans at rjbank are generally collateralized by real estate or other property 
rjbank provides for both an allowance for losses in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and a reserve for individually impaired loans in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by a creditor for impairment of a loan 
the calculation of the sfas no 
allowance is subjective as management segregates the loan portfolio into different classes and assigns each class an allowance percentage based on the perceived risk associated with that class of loans 
the factors taken into consideration when assigning the reserve percentage to each class include estimates of borrower default probabilities and collateral values  trends in delinquencies  volume and terms  changes in geographic distribution  lending policies  local  regional  and national economic conditions  concentrations of credit risk and past loss history 
in addition  the company provides for potential losses inherent in rjbank s unfunded lending commitments using the criteria above  further adjusted for an estimated probability of funding 
for individual loans identified as impaired  rjbank measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
at september   the amortized cost of all rjbank loans was billion and an allowance for loan losses of million was recorded against that balance 
the allowance for loan losses is approximately of the amortized cost of the loan portfolio 
the company also makes loans or pays advances to financial advisors  primarily for recruiting and retention purposes 
the company provides for an allowance for loan losses on such receivables based on historical collection experience 
additionally  the company provides for a specific reserve on these receivables if a financial advisor is no longer associated with the company and it is determined that it is probable the amount will not be collected 
at september  the receivable from financial advisors was million  which is net of an allowance of million for estimated uncollectibility 
income taxes sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

effects of inflation the company s assets are primarily liquid in nature and are not significantly affected by inflation 
management believes that the changes in replacement cost of property and equipment are adequately insured and therefore would not materially affect operating results 
however  the rate of inflation affects the company s expenses  including employee compensation  communications and occupancy  which may not be readily recoverable through charges for services provided by the company

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management risks are an inherent part of the company s business and activities 
management of these risks is critical to the company s fiscal soundness and profitability 
risk management at the company is a multi faceted process that requires communication  judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets 
the company s senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and requires specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification  assessment  monitoring and control of various risks 
the principal risks involved in the company s business activities are market  credit  operational  and regulatory and legal 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss to the company resulting from changes in interest rates and equity prices 
the company has exposure to market risk primarily through its broker dealer and banking operations 
the company s broker dealer subsidiaries trade tax exempt and taxable debt obligations and act as an active market maker in approximately over the counter equity securities 
in connection with these activities  the company maintains inventories in order to ensure availability of securities and to facilitate client transactions 
additionally  the company  primarily within its canadian broker dealer subsidiary  invests for its own proprietary equity investment account 
the following table represents the fair value of trading inventories associated with the company s broker dealer client facilitation  market making activities and proprietary trading activities 
september  september  securities securities sold but sold but trading not yet trading not yet securities purchased securities purchased in s marketable municipal corporate government agency total debt securities derivative contracts equity securities other securities total changes in value of the company s trading inventory may result from fluctuations in interest rates  credit ratings of the issuer  equity prices and the correlation among these factors 
the company manages its trading inventory by product type and has established trading divisions that have responsibility for each product type 
the company s primary method of controlling risk in its trading inventory is through the establishment and monitoring of limits on the dollar amount of securities positions that can be entered into and other risk based limits  limits are established both for categories of securities eg  otc equities  high yield securities  municipal bonds and for individual traders 
as of september   the absolute fixed income and equity inventory limits were  and  respectively 
the company s trading activities were well within these limits at september  position limits in trading inventory accounts are monitored on a daily basis 
consolidated position and exposure reports are prepared and distributed to senior management 
limit violations are carefully monitored 
management also monitors inventory levels and trading results  as well as inventory aging  pricing  concentration and securities ratings 
for derivatives  primarily interest rate swaps  the company monitors exposure in its derivatives subsidiary daily based on established limits with respect to a number of factors  including interest rate risk  spread  ratio and basis risk and volatility 
these exposures are monitored both on a total portfolio basis and separately for selected maturity periods 
interest rate risk rja is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of maintaining trading inventories of fixed income instruments  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the company monitors  on a daily basis  the value at risk var in its institutional fixed income trading portfolios cash instruments and interest rate derivatives 
var is a technique for estimating the potential loss in the company s fixed income portfolio due to adverse market movements over a specified time horizon with a specified confidence level 
during fiscal and the first three quarters of fiscal the company used a variance covariance methodology  for calculating var 
a standard regulatory type data set was used one year historical observation period  exponential decay and the results were compared daily against those obtained using corresponding data with a exponential decay factor 
during the fourth quarter  the company adopted a new risk management technology which uses historical simulation for calculating var 
simulated scenarios were derived based on a one year observation period  with equal weighting to overnight change scenarios 
var is reported at a confidence level  based on a one day holding period  this is consistent with the company s high turnover trading activity  which is based on supporting client sales activity 
this means that there is a one in chance that on any given day  the daily trading net revenues could fall below the expected daily trading net revenues by an amount at least as large as the reported var 
however  shortfalls on a single day can exceed reported var by significant amounts 
shortfalls can also accumulate over a longer time horizon  such as a number of consecutive trading days 
the following tables set forth the high  low  and daily average var for the company s overall institutional portfolio during the fiscal year ended september   with the corresponding dollar value of the company s portfolio 
because var results based on the two methodologies are not directly comparable  results below are reported separately for the first three quarters and for the fourth quarter of fiscal first three quarters ended june  fourth quarter ended september  high low daily average high low daily average in s var portfolio value net var as a percent of portfolio value the mark to market loss in the portfolio exceeded the reported var once during and four times in the modeling of the risk characteristics of trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations 
while management believes that its assumptions and approximations are reasonable  there is no uniform industry methodology for estimating var  and different assumptions and or approximations could produce materially different var estimates 
given its reliance on historical data  var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions 
an inherent limitation of var is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk  particularly during periods of unusual market events and disruptions  moreover  var calculated for a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges within one day 
accordingly  management also monitors the risk in its trading activities by establishing position limits and daily review of trading results  inventory aging  pricing  concentration  and securities ratings 
additional information is discussed under derivative financial instruments in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
rjbank maintains an investment portfolio that is comprised of mortgage backed securities  as well as mortgage  consumer and commercial loans 
those investments are funded in part by its client obligations  including demand deposits  money market accounts  savings accounts  and certificates of deposit 
based on the current investment portfolio of rjbank  market risk for rjbank is limited primarily to interest rate risk 
rjbank reviews interest rate risk based on net interest income  which is the net amount of interest received and interest paid 
the following table represents the carrying value of rjbank s assets and liabilities that are subject to market risk 
this table does not include financial instruments with limited market risk exposure due to offsetting asset and liability positions  short holding periods or short periods of time until the interest rate resets 
rjbank financial instruments with market risk as described above  in s september  september  mortgage backed securities municipal obligations loans receivable  net total assets with market risk certificates of deposit federal home loan bank advances interest rate swaps total liabilities with market risk as noted above  rjbank reviews interest rate risk based on net interest income and impact on rjbank s equity 
one of the core objectives of rjbank s asset liability management committee is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
the asset liability management committee uses several measures to monitor and limit rjbank s interest rate risk including scenario analysis  interest repricing gap analysis and limits  and net portfolio value limits 
model based scenario analysis is used to monitor and report the interest rate risk positions  and analyze alternative strategies 
net interest income is the net amount of interest received less interest paid 
this involves large volumes of contracts and transactions  and numerous different products 
simulation models and estimation techniques are used to assess the sensitivity of the net interest income stream to movements in interest rates 
assumptions about consumer behavior play an important role in these calculations  this is particularly relevant for loans such as mortgages where the client has the right  but not the obligation  to repay before the scheduled maturity 
on the liability side  the re pricing characteristics of deposits are based on estimates since the rates are not coupled to a specified market rate 
the sensitivity of net interest income to interest rate conditions is estimated for a variety of scenarios 
assuming an immediate and lasting shift of basis points in the term structure of interest rates  rjbank s sensitivity analysis indicates that an upward movement would decrease rjbank s net interest income by in the first year after the rate jump  whereas a downward shift of the same magnitude would decrease rjbank s net interest income by 
these sensitivity figures are based on positions as of september   and are subject to certain simplifying assumptions  including that management takes no corrective action 
the outcome is affected by higher pre payment expectations if rates fall 
equity price risk the company is exposed to equity price risk as a consequence of making markets in equity securities and the investment activities of rja and rj ltd 
the us broker dealer activities are client driven  with the objective of meeting clients needs while earning a trading profit to compensate for the risk associated with carrying inventory 
the company attempts to reduce the risk of loss inherent in its inventory of equity securities by monitoring those security positions constantly throughout each day and establishing position limits 
the company s canadian broker dealer has traders that may hold proprietary trading positions in addition to their customer trading positions 
the average aggregate inventory held for proprietary trading during the year ended september  was cdn  the company s equity securities inventories are priced on a regular basis and there are no material unrecorded gains or losses 
credit risk the company is engaged in various trading and brokerage activities whose counterparties primarily include broker dealers  banks and other financial institutions 
the company is exposed to risk that counterparties may not fulfill their obligations 
the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty and or the issuer of the instrument 
the company manages this risk by imposing and monitoring individual and aggregate position limits within each business segment for each counterparty  conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties  reviewing security and loan concentrations  holding and marking to market collateral on certain transactions and conducting business through clearing organizations  which guarantee performance 
the company s client activities involve the execution  settlement  and financing of various transactions on behalf of its clients 
client activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis 
credit exposure associated with the company s private client group consists primarily of customer margin accounts  which are monitored daily and are collateralized 
when clients execute a purchase the company is at some risk that the client will renege on the trade 
if this occurs  the company may have to liquidate the position at a loss 
however  for over three quarters of the private client group purchase transactions  clients have available funds in the account before the trade is executed 
the company monitors exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and performs analysis on a regular basis in connection with its margin lending activities 
the company adjusts its margin requirements if it believes its risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions 
in addition  rjbank offers a variety of loan products including mortgage  commercial real estate  and consumer loans  which are collateralized  and corporate loans for which the borrower is carefully evaluated and monitored 
rjbank s policy is to require customers to provide collateral prior to the disbursement of approved loans 
the amount of collateral obtained  if it is deemed necessary by rjbank upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  residential real estate  and income producing commercial properties 
by using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates  rjbank exposes itself to credit risk with those counterparties also 
rjbank minimizes the credit or repayment risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions only with high quality counterparties whose credit rating is investment grade 
the company is subject to concentration risk if it holds large positions  extends large loans to  or has large commitments with a single counterparty  borrower  or group of similar counterparties or borrowers eg in the same industry 
securities purchased under agreements to resell consist entirely of securities issued by the us government 
receivables from and payables to clients and stock borrow and lending activities are conducted with a large number of clients and counterparties and potential concentration is carefully monitored 
inventory and investment positions taken and commitments made  including underwritings  may involve exposure to individual issuers and businesses 
the company seeks to limit this risk through careful review of the underlying business and the use of limits established by senior management  taking into consideration factors including the financial strength of the counterparty  the size of the position or commitment  the expected duration of the position or commitment and other positions or commitments outstanding 
the company is the lessor in two leveraged commercial aircraft transactions with two major domestic airlines delta and continental 
the company s ability to realize its expected return is dependent upon the airlines ability to fulfill their lease obligations 
in the event that the airlines default on their lease commitments and the trustee for the debt holders is unable to re lease or sell the planes with adequate terms  the company would suffer a loss of some or all of its investment 
delta airlines filed for bankruptcy protection on september  accordingly  the company recorded a million pretax charge to fully reserve the balance of its investment in the leveraged lease of an aircraft to delta 
the company took a million pretax charge in the prior year to partially reserve for this investment 
in addition  the company is closely monitoring its lease to continental airlines 
although continental has not defaulted on its obligations under this lease  continental s financial condition has continued to deteriorate  thus increasing the likelihood of such a default 
operational risk operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from the company s operations  including  but not limited to  business disruptions  improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions  deficiencies in the company s technology or financial operating systems and inadequacies or breaches in the company s control processes 
the company operates different businesses in diverse markets and is reliant on the ability of its employees and systems to process a large number of transactions 
these risks are less direct than credit and market risk  but managing them is critical  particularly in a rapidly changing environment with increasing transaction volumes 
in the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems or improper action by employees  the company could suffer financial loss  regulatory sanctions and damage to its reputation 
in order to mitigate and control operational risk  the company has developed and continues to enhance specific policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels throughout the organization and within such departments as accounting  operations  information technology  legal  compliance and internal audit 
these control mechanisms attempt to ensure that operational policies and procedures are being followed and that the company s various businesses are operating within established corporate policies and limits 
business continuity plans exist for critical systems  and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate 
a compliance and standards committee comprised of senior executives meets monthly to consider policy issues 
the committee reviews material customer complaints and litigation  as well as issues in operating departments  for the purpose of identifying issues that present risk exposure to customers or to the company 
the committee adopts policies to deal with these issues  which are then disseminated throughout the company 
the company has established a quality of markets committee that meets regularly to review execution of customer orders by the otc  option and listed trading departments 
this committee is comprised of representatives from the otc  listed trading  options  compliance and legal departments and is under the direction of a senior officer of the company 
this committee reviews reports from otc  option and listed trading departments and recommends action for improvement when necessary 
regulatory and legal risk legal risk includes the risk of private client group customer claims  the possibility of sizable adverse legal judgments and non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
the company is generally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which it conducts business 
regulatory oversight of the securities industry has become increasingly demanding over the past several years and the company  as well as others in the industry  has been directly affected by this increased regulatory scrutiny 
the company has comprehensive procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of customer funds  extension of credit  collection activities  money laundering and record keeping 
the company and its subsidiaries have designated anti money laundering compliance officers who monitor compliance with regulations adopted under the usa patriot act 
the company acts as an underwriter or selling group member in both equity and fixed income product offerings 
particularly when acting as lead or co lead manager  the company has financial and legal exposure 
to manage this exposure  a committee of senior executives review proposed underwriting commitments to assess the quality of the offering and the adequacy of due diligence investigation 
the company s major business units have compliance departments that are responsible for regularly reviewing and revising compliance and supervisory procedures to conform to changes in applicable regulations 
during the past two years  the number of claims declined but it is still above long term historic levels 
while these claims may not be the result of any wrongdoing  the company does  at a minimum  incur costs associated with investigating and defending against such claims
