governmental approvals and regulation regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of embrex s products and in its on going research and development activities 
although the use of the inovoject system or its other devices are not subject to regulatory approval in the united states  animal health products being developed by embrex and other companies must receive approval for marketing from either the usda or the food and drug administration the fda and from similar regulatory agencies in foreign countries where the company has begun or contemplates doing business 
these countries also may require approval of the inovoject system or its other devices 
regulatory agencies require that products be tested and demonstrate appropriate levels of safety and efficacy 
generally  with respect to animal health products in the united states  the usda has regulatory authority over products which are biological in origin or which stimulate or affect an animal s immune system and the fda has authority over all other animal health products 
the time and cost for usda approvals are generally less than those for fda approvals 
fda approvals generally require more extensive animal and toxicology testing than usda approvals and may take five or more years to obtain  whereas usda approvals generally take one to three years to obtain

introduction embrex is an international agricultural biotechnology company engaged in the development of innovative in ovo solutions that meet the needs of the global poultry industry 
the company derives most of its global revenues from lease fees for the number of eggs processed by the inovoject system 
other revenue sources for the company come from lease fees related to the egg remover system and vaccine saver option 
in addition to these sources  the company may sell each of these devices to distributors under special circumstances in selected countries and to human flu vaccine manufacturers 
revenues from these sources are categorized as device revenues in the company s financial statements 
another source of revenues for the company is product sales  which currently consist of sales of in ovo vaccines  bursaplex and newplex 
the company also derives some revenues from contract research and development r d  grant sources and other minor products 
the company s cost of revenue is primarily attributable to the costs of supporting the company s devices at customer locations around the world 
these costs include the labor  travel and parts necessary to ensure proper operation and maintenance of embrex s devices located at hatcheries of the company s customers  as well as associated depreciation  sales and property tax expenses 
during the company experienced consolidated revenue growth of primarily due to an increase in device revenues 
approximately of the device revenue increase occurred outside of the united states primarily driven by new inovoject system customers in latin america 
the revenue increase and maintaining the company s gross margin at resulted in a increase in gross profit 
a increase in general and administrative expenses partially offset by a decrease in research and development expenses resulted in a decrease in operating profit due primarily to additional sarbanes oxley compliance related expenses  inovocox production facility expenses and other increases described below 
total other income was million higher in than primarily due to the million fort dodge settlement  which netted million after legal fees 
these changes resulted in a decrease in income before taxes 
income taxes were higher in than and the effective tax rate increased from to due to changes described below

table of contents consolidated net income for decreased to million  lower than net income of million  which was higher than net income of million 
diluted earnings per share were in  in and in the decrease in net income compared to was primarily due to the million settlement of the company s litigation with fort dodge in net of legal fees and million spent on accounting fees for sarbanes oxley compliance in  which is a million increase over outstanding shares in thousands weighted average shares outstanding diluted average shares outstanding the weighted average shares outstanding increased by  shares from to  or less than  and decreased by  shares from to  or 
the decrease in outstanding shares from to is primarily due to the repurchase of shares in pursuant to the company s share repurchase programs 
the diluted average shares outstanding decreased by  shares from to  or approximately  which was due to common stock repurchases by the company during as well as the decrease in the average closing share price of the company s common stock from per share in to per share in the decrease in stock price lowered the number of outstanding stock options with exercise prices that were less than the market price of embrex s stock ie  in the money stock options 
because only in the money stock options are counted in computing diluted average shares outstanding  the lower average closing price for the company s common stock in as compared to resulted in less stock options being taken into account in diluted average shares outstanding decreased  shares  or less than from to this decrease is due to the repurchase of shares in pursuant to the company s share repurchase programs  which was partially offset by the increase in the average closing share price of the company s common stock from in to in  which resulted in more in the money stock options being taken into account in computing diluted average shares outstanding

device revenues totaled million in compared to million in and million in  representing increases of from to  and from to the revenue increase derives mainly from increased device fees  which is primarily due to an increase in the inovoject system customer base  as well as new egg remover installations 
other revenues decreased from million in to million in and from million in to in both the and other revenues were derived from miscellaneous revenues for minor products  refunds and miscellaneous grants 
the other revenues were primarily derived from funding provided by cobb vantress in support of the gender sort project  federal advanced technology program atp funds supporting the company s collaborative development project with origen therapeutics  inc and small business innovation research funding for device development work 
the decrease from to is primarily due to grant funding from cobb vantress in support of the gender sort project that occurred in that did not recur in  as well as the withdrawal of the atp grant 
during  the us dollar weakened against select currencies compared to the same period during if average exchange rates during had remained the same 
table of contents as the average exchange rates for these currencies during  the company s revenues would have been approximately million lower and the overall increase would have been million rather than the actual increase of million 
the revenues include device lease fees for use of inovoject and egg remover systems and vaccine saver option by poultry producers in the united states and foreign countries  and the sale of devices to distributors and human flu vaccine manufacturers 
the sporadic nature of device sales to distributors and human flu vaccine companies may cause variability in revenue and gross profit on an annual and quarterly basis 
embrex estimates that as of december   it was vaccinating in excess of of the estimated nine billion broiler birds grown in the united states and canada in given its market penetration  the company expects only limited inovoject systems revenue and earnings growth in this market  most of which is anticipated to come from new egg remover installations 
in addition  the introduction of competitor machines could affect growth and or the maintenance of the company s revenues 
sales of bursaplex  the company s proprietary vaccine for the treatment of avian infectious bursal disease  was the source of approximately million of product revenues in both and  and million of product revenues in bursaplex sales growth from to was restrained mainly by continued challenges in asia resulting from avian influenza outbreaks and poor economic conditions 
if the effects of avian influenza subside and production and consumption levels  as well as exports from the asian region increase  the company anticipates that increased injection activity and bursaplex sales could occur 
bursaplex sales decreased from to primarily due to lower sales caused by the company s japanese distributor s excess inventory  a weak market in latin america and a weak market in asia caused primarily by lower poultry production in korea resulting from an oversupply of poultry and poor economic conditions at the end of limited initial sales of newplex  the company s proprietary vaccine for the treatment of newcastle disease  were generated in the company anticipates sales growth of this product in as registrations to sell newplex are approved in markets outside the us like bursaplex  newplex registrations and sales are affected by economic conditions in non us markets  particularly in asia with its challenges related to avian influenza 
although several registrations to sell newplex were approved in and more approvals are anticipated in  there can be no assurance that newplex will be commercially accepted in these markets 
management anticipates minor revenue and earnings growth in from existing inovoject system operations in the united states and canada  higher revenue and earnings growth from new inovoject system leases in other countries  and sales of bursaplex and newplex products to poultry producers worldwide 
however  the rate at which the marketplace will accept the inovoject system technology outside the united states and canada  the degree of acceptance of our competitor s machines within the united states and elsewhere  the timing of regulatory approvals of third party vaccines for in ovo use outside the united states and canada  costs associated with market expansion  possible variability in united states hatchery bird production as a result of grain price fluctuations  and variability in the demand for  and pricing of  us poultry and poultry products both inside and outside the united states  will impact the pace of revenue growth  if any  and sustained profitability from the installation and operational throughputs of inovoject systems 
in addition  avian disease outbreaks in markets where embrex has device placements and sales also may affect future revenues 
demand for both bursaplex and newplex is affected by local poultry producers perceived degree of viral challenge 
this may impact future revenues as well

consequently  gross margin was for both and  and for gross margin is affected by material costs related to servicing the company s devices and changes in the company s product mix  described in revenues above 
the decrease in gross margin between and was primarily due to higher material costs related to servicing the company s devices  resulting in an increase in the cost of parts used to maintain the company s devices 
stainless steel prices caused an increase in depreciation expenses due to increased capital cost for new devices 
if material costs and stainless steel prices increase in the future  these increases could cause gross margins to decrease in the future if the company is unable to pass these increases through to customers 
also  downward pressure on device lease fees  upward changes in other input costs and modifications in product mix could cause gross margins to decrease in the future

operating expenses for r d in were million  compared to and expenses of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in operating expenses from to is primarily due to reclassification of patent related legal fees previously recorded as r d expense that now are reflected as g a expense  as well as the allocation of indirect expenses related to the early delivery project from g a to r d that were not allocated in due to suspension of the atp grant in late reorganization of r d staff to global product development supply gpds and lower contract r d expenses contribute to the decrease in operating expenses as well 
the decrease in operating expenses from to is primarily due to lower contract r d expenses  which partially resulted from a change in the inovocox team s focus from pure research to the design and building of the embrex poultry health facility 
the second of these departments  gpds  is responsible for development and testing of commercial machine devices and supply of vaccine products

actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies are material to the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition revenues for devices subject to lease agreements are recognized based on eggs processed during the period in accordance with lease terms 
device and product sales are recognized upon delivery  as that is when title passes to the customer 
contract research revenue is recognized as services are performed or as milestones are met over the term of the contract 
grant revenue is recognized as expenses related to the specific grants are incurred 
revenue received  but not yet earned  is classified as deferred revenue 
the revenue section of the consolidated statement of operations divides revenues into three sections device revenues which include device lease fees and device sales  product sales which include sales of the company s vaccines  bursaplex and newplex  and other revenues which includes income derived from contract research  grants from federal agencies and other miscellaneous sources 
allowance for uncollectible accounts to date  the company has not experienced any material trade accounts receivable collection issues 
however  based on a review of cumulative balances  industry experience and the current economic environment  the company currently reserves from to of trade accounts receivable  depending on the credit terms in various markets  as an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
in addition  adjustments due to the financial stability of individual customers will affect the overall percentage reserved 
once the company determines an account is uncollectible it writes off the receivable balance against the reserve 
accounts are written off based on individual circumstances and only after all efforts of collection have been exhausted 
the consolidated balance reserved for uncollectible accounts as of december  was million  which represents of the trade accounts receivable balance at december  warranty accruals to date  the company has not experienced any material device or product warranty issues in excess of amounts reserved 
based on the sale and lease of devices and sale of products  the company has established a reserve for future claims 
the reserve is based on the estimated damages that a customer would experience if an inovoject system or batch of bursaplex or newplex should fail to perform to product specifications 
the consolidated balance reserved for warranties as of december  was million 
inventory obsolescence to date  the company has not experienced any material inventory obsolescence 
however  based on a percentage of the current product and device parts inventory levels  the company has established a reserve against future device parts obsolescence due to technological improvements and limited shelf life of product inventories 
the percentage used to calculate the reserve is based on a historical percentage rate adjusted for anticipated technological advances on devices and shelf life of existing vaccine product inventories 
the consolidated balance reserved for product and parts obsolescence as of december  was million 
deferred tax assets the company records deferred tax assets based upon amounts that are likely to be realized 
based on the company s recent profitability and belief that will result in an overall profit  the company has recorded net current and long term deferred tax assets of million 
the company s net deferred tax assets include a valuation allowance for two items that the company may not be able to realize in future periods 
the two items are research and development tax credits and deferred tax assets in a foreign subsidiary 
this determination is based  in part  on historical operating performance as well as the likelihood of future income 
the valuation allowance will be recognized when the company believes that the likelihood of recognition is more likely than not 
in the event the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
however  in the event the company was to determine that it would not be able to realize its net recorded deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease income in the period such determination was made 
employee fringe benefit plan accrual the company has established a reserve related to embrex s employee fringe benefit plan 
the most significant component of the accrual is the amount reserved for the employee self insured health plan 
the amount of the reserve is based on management s estimate of future employee health claims 
the reserve covers expected short term claims and is based on historical data adjusted for major events and anticipated changes in headcount or participation 
the net balance reserved for the employee self insured health plan as of december  was million 

table of contents effect of inflation the company expects cost of product sales and device revenues  operating expenses and capital equipment costs to change in line with periodic inflationary changes in price levels 
while the company generally believes that it will be able to offset the effect of price level changes by adjusting selling lease prices and effecting operating efficiencies  any material unfavorable changes in price levels could have a material adverse affect on its results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company s cash and cash equivalents balances totaled million compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the decrease from to is primarily attributable to a million decrease in cash provided by long term debt  as well as the million reduction in net income resulting from the million settlement with fort dodge in and an increase in sarbanes oxley act related expenses 
a million increase in cash used to repurchase shares of common stock contributed to the decrease in cash balances as well 
this was partially offset by a million decrease in cash used for investing in capital expenditures 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents from to reflects the cash received from debt financing the building of the embrex poultry health inovocox manufacturing facility and a favorable currency translation adjustment  offset by a million decrease in cash provided by operations and an million increase in cash used for investing in capital expenditures  including building of the embrex poultry health facility 
during  operating activities generated million in cash  primarily due to net income  non cash depreciation  a change in the deferred tax asset and the increase in accounts receivable 
for investing activities  device purchases and other capital expenditures used million and the embrex poultry health facility required million 
financing activities used million primarily due to common stock repurchases of million and payoff of million of short term debt under the credit facility with company s bank  branch banking and trust company bb t as described below 
these were partially offset by the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options and employee stock purchase plan purchases for million and the issuance of million of long term debt from bb t  under the construction term loan described below 
the company obtained a million construction term loan from bb t  in august that was used for building and equipping the embrex poultry health coccidiosis vaccine manufacturing facility located in scotland county  north carolina 
at december   million of the construction term loan had been borrowed 
the company has a million secured revolving line of credit with bb t  which may be used for working capital purposes 
the term of this line of credit previously has been extended to may and the company anticipates bb t will renew this credit facility for a renewal term beyond may the line of credit carries an interest rate of the current libor rate plus 
at december   the company had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility 
in august  the company announced that the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program the repurchase program to purchase up to of outstanding shares of common stock  or up to approximately  shares over months  in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
in november  the board of directors extended the term of the repurchase program to june  during the first half of  the company purchased  shares of its common stock for million at an average price of per share 
the company repurchased an aggregate of  shares of its common stock for million at an average price of per share during the entire term of the repurchase program 
in may  the company announced that the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program the repurchase program to purchase up to  of outstanding shares of common stock through december  in open market or privately negotiated transactions on or after july  during the second half of  the company purchased  shares of its common stock for million at an average price of per share 

table of contents see note  shareholders equity of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s repurchase programs 
based on its current operations  management believes that the company s available cash and cash equivalents  together with cash flow from operations and its bank line of credit  will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements as these currently exist 
however  embrex may continue to explore additional alternative funding opportunities with respect to collaborative ventures and product expansion and would evaluate its cash requirements as appropriate 
contractual obligations embrex s known contractual obligations as of december  are summarized below contractual obligations payments due by period thousands of dollars total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet under gaap total the long term debt obligation listed in the chart represents the total amount due plus interest under embrex s construction term loan with bb t 
embrex borrowed million as of december   and will be obligated to repay the debt as shown in the chart 
see note  debt of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s long term debt obligation 
long term debt and certain lease obligations contain acceleration provisions requiring immediate repayment in the event of default as defined in each agreement 
short term obligations recorded on the consolidated balance sheet equaled million as of december  of the outstanding purchase obligations included in the table above a total of million were purchased during off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that may have a current or future material effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capitalization resources 
risk factors if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition  or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our future growth depends on expansion of international revenues and we will be subject to increased risks in the international marketplace we estimate that our inovoject system inoculates more than of all eggs produced for the united states and canada broiler poultry markets 
given this market penetration  we expect only limited growth in the number of system installations and only minor system revenue growth in this market 
additionally  due to our market penetration and the significance of the united states and canada poultry markets to our revenue  any adverse conditions in these markets could have a material and adverse affect on our revenues 
for this reason  we must expand our device installations and product sales in markets outside the united states and canada in order to realize revenue growth 
in  international sales accounted for of our consolidated revenues 
in and  international sales accounted for and of our consolidated revenues  respectively 
revenue growth outside the united states and canada depends on gaining market acceptance of our devices and in ovo administration of vaccine products in markets outside the united states and canada to treat prevailing poultry diseases in those markets 
lack of market acceptance of our devices and in ovo products in these markets would materially adversely affect our revenue growth 

table of contents international sales are also subject to a variety of risks  including risks arising from the following exchange rate risks  tariffs  trade barriers and taxes  adverse changes in local investment or exchange control regulations  potential restrictions on the flow of international capital  and the possibility of confiscatory taxation  price controls or the taking or modification of our property rights by a country in the exercise of its sovereignty  economic and political conditions beyond our control  including country specific conditions such as political instability  government corruption and civil unrest  the risk that current product registrations subject to periodic re registration in certain foreign countries may not be granted a renewal license due to regulatory changes or other reasons  and trade restrictions and economic embargoes imposed by the united states and other countries 
for example  we have an arrangement for the distribution of burasplex in syria  but currently are not distributing any product in syria and have no intention of doing so in the foreseeable future whether or not the trade restrictions existed 
our future growth also depends on the development and market acceptance of new products in addition to international expansion  we need to develop and market new products to continue to generate increased revenues and growth of our business 
we currently are developing  both independently and in collaboration with others  various products which address poultry health and performance needs 
these products are being designed to be delivered in ovo through the inovoject system or in conjunction with the inovoject system  and are in various stages of development 
the company may increase  decrease or eliminate funding for any product under development at any time depending on the company s assessment of its priorities  its available funding  the probability that the product can be successfully commercialized  potential return on investment and other factors 
there is no guarantee that any new products will be successfully developed and marketed 
in addition  we have not initiated the regulatory approval process for some of these potential products  and we cannot assure you that regulatory approval will be obtained 
our inability to develop new products or any delay in our development of them may materially adversely affect our revenue growth 
because of a number of factors  a new product may not reach the market without lengthy delays  if at all 
some of the factors that may affect our development and marketing of new products include the following our research and evaluations of compounds and new technologies may not yield product opportunities  potential products may involve extensive and time consuming clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness  and the results of such trials are uncertain  potential products may require collaborative partners and we may be unable to identify partners or enter into arrangements on terms acceptable to us  we may not be able to contract for the manufacture of new products at a cost or in quantities necessary to make them commercially viable  domestic and international regulatory approval of these products may not be obtained or may be obtained only with lengthy delays  
table of contents we may not be able to secure additional financing that may be needed to bring a potential product to market  we may experience unexpected safety  regulatory or efficacy concerns with respect to marketed products  whether or not scientifically justified  leading to adverse public reaction  product recalls  withdrawals or declining sales  marketing products developed jointly with other parties may require royalty payments or other payments by us to our co developers  which may materially adversely affect our profitability  we may be unable to accurately predict market requirements and evolving standards  and we may not be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified development personnel 
we have developed and commercialized two devices that work with the inovoject system the egg remover and vaccine saver 
the egg remover can also be used without an inovoject system in specific situations where customers do not need injection services 
these two products have had initial success  however  there is no guarantee that acceptance of these products will continue to grow 
embrex has initiated the united states department of agriculture  or usda  regulatory approval process with respect to our in ovo coccidiosis vaccine  inovocox 
although this product has begun the regulatory review process  there is no assurance that usda approval will be obtained 
marketing this product in foreign countries will require us to pursue separate approvals from foreign regulatory agencies 
we completed construction of a million vaccine manufacturing facility in the first quarter of to commercially produce the inovocox vaccine 
in addition to usda approval for inovocox  our coccidiosis vaccine manufacturing facility must receive a separate usda approval to manufacture the inovocox vaccine 
we cannot assure you that the facility will receive usda approval to manufacture inovocox 
delays in obtaining either product or manufacturing facility approvals may materially adversely affect our marketing of  and our ability to receive revenues from  inovocox 
additionally  even if we receive usda product and facility approvals  we cannot assure you that inovocox will be sold in commercial quantities or that product sales will be sufficient to offset our investment in development of the product and construction of the coccidiosis vaccine manufacturing facility 
we are also developing a device to separate poultry by gender while still in the egg 
we cannot assure you that our development work will lead to a successful commercial device 
we have developed and commercialized antigen antibody complex  or aac  technology which the company uses in its bursaplex vaccine 
bursaplex has been sold in commercial quantities during the past six years  however  there is no assurance that the product will continue to be sold in commercial quantities 
in may  the usda provided regulatory approval of newplex  our in ovo newcastle disease vaccine  within the united states 
newplex vaccine is also based on aac technology 
we are now seeking regulatory approval for newplex in key markets worldwide 
although we have received approval to sell newplex in five countries  there is no assurance that other registrations will be granted or that newplex will be sold in commercial quantities 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully complete the development and commercialization of any new products or that such products  if developed and commercialized  will meet revenue and profit expectations 
economic factors affecting our customers may adversely affect our financial results our revenues principally come from leases and sales to the poultry industry 
if there is a general economic decline in that industry  our operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
also  domestic and global economic factors beyond our control may adversely impact our customers and  as a result  our revenues and earnings 
examples of these factors include the following fluctuations in the prices of energy and poultry feed  disease outbreaks that adversely affect poultry production  
table of contents market demand for poultry products  including the supply and pricing of alternative proteins  costs to comply with applicable laws and regulations  including those relating to environmental protection  food safety  market regulation and genetically modified organisms or ingredients  product recalls and related adverse publicity and consumer reaction  access to foreign markets together with foreign economic conditions  including currency fluctuations and trade restrictions  and the extent to which our cost of products and operating expenses increase faster than contractual price adjustments with our customers 
for example  if rising poultry feed prices increase the production costs of commercial poultry producers or a foreign government bans the importation of us chicken  these producers may reduce production 
this decreased production could adversely impact our revenues  since a principal component of our revenues are fees charged to customers for the number of eggs injected or processed by embrex devices 
we face risks of competition and changing technology the inovoject system uses a process that was patented in the united states by the usda in we held the exclusive license to the sharma patent until june  when the sharma patent expired 
with the expiration of the sharma patent  competitive in ovo delivery systems are being developed and marketed 
embrex is aware of four companies that are marketing in ovo injection systems to poultry companies 
although there has not been widespread commercial acceptance of any of these competing systems  the company is aware of direct competition for customers and limited commercial placements by two of these companies 
competition could result in lower prices for our products  reduced demand for our products  and a corresponding reduction in our ability to recover development  engineering  manufacturing and service costs 
in addition  if a competitor become successful selling its devices  embrex may have to evaluate the viability of its current leasing model 
also  a significant portion of our revenues comes from a relatively small number of customers 
if we lose one or more large customers due to competition  our revenues could be significantly lower 
any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the poultry vaccine business is especially competitive and dominated by a few large companies with an established global presence 
in order for us to expand our sales of in ovo vaccines  these products must be commercially accepted worldwide and compete effectively against the vaccines of these other companies 
our inability to compete successfully in the poultry vaccine sector could materially adversely affect our revenue growth 
our competitors and potential competitors include independent companies that specialize in biotechnology  as well as major agricultural or animal health companies  pharmaceutical companies  chemical companies  universities  and public and private research organizations 
many of these competitors are well established and have substantially greater marketing  financial  technological and other resources than we have 
competitors may succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any that have been or are being developed by us or that could render our technology and products obsolete or non competitive 
we face risks related to compliance with laws impacting corporate governance and financial reporting standards the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as related new rules and regulations implemented by the securities and exchange commission  nasdaq and the public company accounting oversight board  have required changes in the corporate governance practices and financial reporting standards for public companies 
these new laws  rules and regulations  including compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  have materially increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time consuming and more burdensome 
the costs of compliance with these laws  rules and regulations have adversely affected our financial results 
moreover  we run the risk of non compliance which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations or the trading price of our stock 
for example  recently when conducting our assessment of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section  we identified a material weakness in our internal controls in the area of accounting for income taxes 
although we are taking steps to address this material weakness  there is no assurance that we will be successful in remedying the material weakness or preventing future material weaknesses 

table of contents poultry health and disease factors affecting our customers may adversely affect our financial results any widespread poultry health problem or disease outbreak could have a negative impact on global poultry production 
our revenues and earnings derived from both the us and international poultry industry could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  the emergence of new disease variants  serotypes and strains in the domestic and or global markets may reduce the efficacy of our vaccine products and result in reduced revenues and earnings 
on the other hand  poultry disease could also positively affect our financial results if an infectious bursal disease or newcastle disease outbreak occurs in a country where bursaplex or newplex is registered and available 
we do not manufacture most of our devices or any of our vaccine products  and are dependent on one contract manufacturer for inovoject and egg remover devices and another contract manufacturer for aac production 
we are also dependent on single contract manufacturers for production of both bursaplex and newplex 
we currently do not have facilities for the production of most of our devices and vaccine products 
therefore  we rely principally upon relationships with contract manufacturers 
there can be no assurance that we can maintain manufacture and supply agreements on terms and at costs acceptable to us 
we have various relationships with manufacturers and suppliers  including those described below 
the loss of any of these relationships could materially adversely affect our operating results 
there are a number of risks associated with our dependence on contract manufacturers  including reduced control over delivery schedules  potential inability to monitor and maintain inventory levels  reduced control over quality assurance  reduced control over manufacturing yields and costs  potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of unanticipated demand  limited warranties on products supplied to us  increases in prices  reduced control over regulatory efforts  potential misappropriation of our intellectual property  catastrophic loss of production capacity due to property damage  either man made or by nature  the loss of these contract manufacturers due to financial circumstances in their respective businesses or their exit from the business lines that manufacture our devices and products  and minimum purchase requirements  which could result in excessive inventories if the demand for products falls short of such minimum purchase requirements 
if our contract manufacturers failed to provide us with an adequate supply of finished devices or vaccine products  our business would be harmed 
we do not have long term contracts or arrangements with several of our vendors that guarantee product availability or the continuation of particular payment terms 
in addition  we are currently dependent on a single contract manufacturer for several of our key products as described below 
although we believe our relationship with each of the manufacturers is sound  we cannot assure you that we will continue to maintain relationships with them or that they will continue to exist 

table of contents inovoject and egg remover systems we rely on precision automation company  inc precision to fabricate all of our inovoject and egg remover systems 
while other machine fabricators exist and have constructed limited numbers of inovoject systems  we do not currently have alternative sources for production of either the inovoject or egg remover systems 
if precision is unable to carry out its manufacturing obligations to our satisfaction  we may be unable to obtain alternative manufacturing  or to obtain such manufacturing on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis 
any delays in the manufacturing process may adversely impact our ability to meet commercial demands for inovoject and egg remover system installations and delay receipt of revenues from those installations 
vaccines and aac technology we obtain all of our requirements for the active ingredient in aac technology from charles river laboratories  inc through its spafas avian products services division  or spafas 
under our agreement with spafas  we are required to purchase minimum amounts of aac based antigen on an annual basis 
the manufacture of aac must be performed in licensed facilities and is subject to usda regulation 
the regulatory approvals granted by the usda for bursaplex in january and for newplex in may specifically cover vaccines produced with spafas manufactured aac 
although there are other manufacturers that may be capable of manufacturing aac  we do not currently have alternative sources for production of aac 
we obtain all of our requirements for bursaplex from merial select  inc  or select  a merck and sanofi aventis company  and all of our requirements for newplex from lohmann animal health international  or lahi 
the manufacture of all vaccine products must be performed in licensed facilities  under approved regulatory methods 
as the usda licensed manufacturers of record  select holds the usda permit for bursaplex and lahi holds the usda permit for newplex 
although there are other manufacturers that may be capable of manufacturing avian viral vaccines  we do not currently have alternative sources for production of either product 
if spafas  select or lahi is unable to carry out its respective manufacturing obligations described immediately above to our satisfaction  we may be unable to obtain alternative manufacturing  or to obtain such manufacturing on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis 
a change of supplier for the company could materially adversely affect our future operating results due to the time it would take a new supplier to obtain regulatory approval by the usda of its production process or manufacturing facilities 
current regulatory approvals in foreign countries are or will be based on product manufactured with aac as manufactured by spafas or bursaplex as manufactured by select or newplex as manufactured by lahi 
a change of manufacturer would result in the need to reapply for regulatory approval in those countries and may lead to suspended sales of that product until new approvals could be secured 
any delays in securing new approvals would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and growth prospects 
we cannot guarantee that we would be able to secure new approvals in every country or that such approvals would be granted in a timely fashion 
we are dependent on distributors in certain markets we market and distribute our devices principally by leasing and licensing the systems directly to hatcheries 
in some markets  such as japan  we instead rely upon distributors for our devices 
we also rely on third parties to market certain of our vaccine products  such as products containing aac technology  and we may enter into other arrangements in the future 
there can be no assurance that we can maintain these relationships on terms acceptable to us 
the loss of any of these relationships could materially adversely affect our operating results 
there are a number of risks associated with our dependence on distributors and other third parties including reduced control over regulatory efforts which may delay local regulatory approvals and thus market introduction  reduced control over marketing and sales efforts and in turn the extent of resulting market penetration or acceptance  
table of contents reduced control over distribution and related customer satisfaction  and potential delays in distribution associated with securing new distributors  including the possible need to seek re registration in markets where a distributor may hold product registration  if current relationships are not maintained 
the loss of key customers could adversely affect our financial results historically  a significant portion of our revenues has come from a relatively small number of customers 
tyson foods  inc accounted for approximately and of our consolidated and revenues  respectively 
during  tyson extended its contract with embrex through tyson is continuing its lease of devices while embrex and tyson are in negotiations for a new contract 
our top three customers  including tyson  accounted for approximately and of our consolidated and revenues  respectively 
we expect a similar level of customer concentration to continue in future years 
the poultry market is highly concentrated  with the largest poultry producers dominating the market 
for example  in  tyson supplied approximately of all broilers grown in the united states 
the concentration of our revenues with these large customers means factors affecting those customers also will impact our revenues and earnings 
if we lose a large customer and fail to add new customers to replace lost revenues  our operating results will be materially and adversely affected 
also  if these customers reduce the number of eggs they incubate at hatcheries  we will receive lower device revenues since our fees are based on the number of eggs injected 
if we lose the protection of our patents and proprietary rights  our financial results could suffer some of our products and processes used to produce our products involve proprietary rights  including patents 
we own some of the technologies employed in these processes  and some are owned by others and licensed to us 
the inovoject system utilizes a process that was patented by the usda in the united states 
we held an exclusive license to the sharma patent  which expired in june we have supplemented the sharma patent with additional us and foreign patents and have submitted additional patent applications covering specific design features of the inovoject system  as well as embrex s egg remover system and vaccine saver option 
our competitors or potential competitors may have filed for  or have received  united states and foreign patents and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights relating to in ovo technology  vaccines  uses and or processes which may compete with our existing products and our products under development 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that our patent applications will result in patents being issued or that  if issued  the claims under our patents will afford protection against competitors with similar technology 
we cannot be sure that others will not obtain patents of different technology that we would need to license or circumvent in order to practice our inventions 
even though we strive to take appropriate action to protect our intellectual property  there is a risk that competitive systems currently being developed and marketed could gain acceptance in the united states or elsewhere 
we believe that patent protection of materials or processes we develop and any products that may result from the research and development efforts of our licensors and us are important to the commercial success of our products 
the loss of the protection of these patents and proprietary rights could materially adversely affect our business and our competitive position in the market 
the patent position of companies such as ours generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions 
some of the reasons for this uncertainty include the following to date  no consistent regulatory policy has emerged regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents 
consequently  there can be no assurance that patent applications relating to our products or technology will result in patents being issued or that  if issued  the patents will afford protection against competitors with similar technology  some patent licenses held by us may be terminated upon the occurrence of specified events or become non exclusive after a specified period  companies that obtain patents claiming products or processes that are necessary for or useful to the development of our products could bring legal actions against us claiming infringement though we currently are not the subject of any patent infringement claim  
table of contents issuance of a valid patent does not prevent other companies from using alternative  non infringing technology so we cannot be sure that any of our patents or patents issued to others and licensed to us will provide significant commercial protection  we may not have the financial resources necessary to obtain patent protection in some countries or to enforce any patent rights we may hold  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting their proprietary rights in these foreign countries  we may be required to obtain licenses from others to develop  manufacture or market our products 
we may not be able to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms  and we cannot be sure that the patents underlying the licenses will be valid and enforceable  and we also rely upon unpatented  proprietary technology  which we may not be able to protect fully if others independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques  improperly gain access to our proprietary technology  or disclose this technology to others 
we attempt to protect our proprietary materials and processes by relying on trade secret laws and non disclosure and confidentiality agreements with our employees and other persons with access to our proprietary materials or processes or who have licensing or research arrangements with us 
we plan to continue to use these protections in the future but we cannot be sure that these agreements will not be breached or that we would have adequate remedies for any breach 
even with these protections  others may independently develop or obtain access to these materials or processes  which may materially adversely affect our competitive position 
if we are sued for infringing the patent or other proprietary rights of a third party  we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management and technical personnel  whether or not the litigation is ultimately determined in our favor 
we have been involved in the patent litigations summarized below embrex v 
service engineering corporation and edward g 
bounds  jr 
in september  we filed a patent infringement suit against service engineering corporation and edward g 
bounds  jr 
in the us district court for the eastern district of north carolina 
this suit concluded in july with the jury finding the patent valid and willfully infringed by the defendants and a judgment being entered in september  which included a monetary award of  in july  the us court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed the award to embrex of approximately million in litigation expenses and costs and upheld the finding of willful infringement 
however  the appeals court vacated the award of direct infringement damages and remanded that issue to the district court for further proceedings 
these proceedings were opened in august  but were stayed early in embrex v 
breuil sa and new tech solutions  inc in december  we filed suit in the us district court for the eastern district of north carolina against breuil sa of landivisiau  france  and new tech solutions  inc of gainesville  ga  asserting patent infringement 
we allege that each of the defendants development of an in ovo selective injection device  designed to compete with our patented inovoject system injection method  vaccine saver option and egg remover system  infringes two of our patents related to our proprietary apparatus and methods for distinguishing live eggs from infertile or dead eggs and for selectively injecting specific eggs identified as suitable for inoculation as well as the apparatus performing this function 
we seek injunctive relief and monetary damages and have asked for a jury trial 
the defendants have denied infringement and alleged that our two patents are invalid 
because of this lawsuit  our results of operations have been impacted and will continue to be impacted by the costs of pursuing this litigation 
moreover  there can be no assurance we will prevail in our claims against breuil sa or new tech solutions  inc even if the court finds in our favor  we have no assurances that any damage award will exceed our costs of pursuing this litigation or that we would be able to collect any damages from either defendant 

table of contents embrex v 
avitech  llc in august  we filed suit in the us district court for the middle district of north carolina against avitech  llc of hebron  maryland asserting patent infringement 
we allege that avitech s injection system  designed to compete with embrex s patented inovoject system  infringes one of the our patents related to our proprietary apparatus and methods for accurately and precisely injecting eggs to the same depth and location when the eggs are of varying sizes and may be presented to the injection apparatus in somewhat different orientations 
we seek injunctive relief and monetary damages and have asked for a jury trial 
the defendant has denied that the north carolina court has jurisdiction and has moved to dismiss or  in the alternative  for transfer to the united states district court in maryland 
we assert that the north carolina court has jurisdiction and have requested jurisdictional discovery to confirm our belief 
if the defendant s motion is resolved in our favor  the lawsuit will proceed in the north carolina court 
because of this lawsuit  our results of operations have been impacted and will continue to be affected by the costs of pursuing this litigation 
moreover  there can be no assurance we will prevail in our claims against avitech  llc 
even if the court finds in our favor  we have no assurances that any damage award will exceed our costs of pursuing this litigation or that we would be able to collect any damages from the defendant 
the loss of key collaborators  suppliers and other key parties could adversely affect our financial results we currently conduct our operations with various third party collaborators  suppliers  licensors or licensees 
we plan to continue developing these relationships and believe our present and future collaborators  suppliers  licensors and licensees will perform their obligations under their agreements with us  based on an economic motivation to succeed 
however  financial or other difficulties facing these parties may affect the amount and timing of funds and other resources devoted by the parties under these agreements 
in addition  disagreements may arise with these third parties which could delay or lead to the termination of the development or commercialization of new products  or result in litigation or arbitration  which would be time consuming and expensive 
thus  there is no assurance that we will develop any new products or generate any revenues from these collaborative agreements 
we are subject to an inherent risk of product liability the development  manufacture  distribution and marketing of our products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity 
these claims may be made even with respect to those products that are manufactured in licensed and approved facilities or that otherwise possess regulatory approval for commercial sale 
these claims could expose us to significant liabilities that could prevent or interfere with the development and marketing of our products 
product liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or pay significant damages 
although we currently maintain liability insurance that we believe is adequate to cover the company s potential exposure in this area  there can be no assurance that the coverage limits of our policies will be adequate 
such insurance is expensive  difficult to obtain and may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or at all 
government regulation and the need for regulatory approval may adversely affect our business regulatory approval required in various areas of our business may materially adversely affect our operations 
the primary emphasis of these requirements is to assure the safety and effectiveness of our products 
while the use of the inovoject system is not subject to regulatory approval in the united states  it may require regulatory approval by foreign agencies 
also  research and development activities and the investigation  manufacture and sale of poultry health products are subject to regulatory approval in the united states by either the usda or the united states food drug administration  or fda  and state agencies  as well as by foreign agencies 
obtaining regulatory approval is a lengthy  costly and uncertain process 
approval by the usda generally takes to years  while approval by the fda may take or more years 
various problems may arise during the regulatory approval process and may have an adverse impact on our operations 
changes in the policies of us and foreign regulatory 
table of contents bodies could increase the time required to obtain regulatory approval for each new product 
delays in obtaining approval may materially adversely affect the marketing of  and the ability to receive revenues and royalties from  products developed by us 
there is no assurance that any future products developed by us or by our collaborative partners will receive regulatory approval without lengthy delays  if at all 
even when approved  regulators may impose limitations on the uses for which the product may be marketed and may continue to review a product after approving it for marketing 
regulators may impose restrictions and sanctions  including banning the continued sale of the product  if they discover problems with the product or its manufacturer 
pursuant to some of our licensing or joint development agreements  the licensees or joint developers bear the costs associated with the regulatory approval process for some products 
we plan to continue to enter into these types of agreements in the future 
if we cannot generate sufficient funds from operations or enter into licensing or joint development agreements to develop products  we may not have the financial resources to complete the regulatory approval process with respect to all or any of the products currently under development 
we may need to obtain approval from appropriate regulators before we can sell our products in a particular jurisdiction 
other regulations apply or may apply to research and manufacturing activities  including federal  state and local laws  regulations and recommendations relating to the following safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  and use and disposal of hazardous substances used in conjunction with research activities 
it is difficult to predict the extent to which these or other government regulations may adversely impact the production and marketing of our products 
our inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our business we must continue to attract and retain experienced and highly educated scientific and management personnel and advisors to be able to develop marketable products and maintain a competitive research and technological position 
competition for qualified employees among biotechnology companies is intense 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified staff 
the departure of any key executive or our inability to recruit and retain key scientific or management personnel could have an adverse affect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our ability to replace key individuals may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the biotechnology industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to develop and commercialize products successfully 
competition to hire from this limited pool is intense  and we may be unable to hire  train  retain or motivate such individuals 
we have obtained insurance in the amount of  on the life of randall l 
marcuson  our president and chief executive officer  of which we are the sole beneficiary 
this amount may not be sufficient to compensate us for the loss of his services 
if we cannot continue to provide timely support and maintenance to our customers  our business may suffer we are required to supply  support  and maintain large numbers of inovoject systems at our customers hatcheries on a timely basis at a reasonable cost to us 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to provide these services on a timely or cost effective basis 
if we are unable to do so  our customers may reduce their use of our products  which could materially adversely affect our operating results 
we have anti takeover defenses that could discourage or delay a takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of discouraging or delaying an acquisition of our company 
for example  the board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to determine the designations  preferences and relative rights and qualifications  limitations or restrictions of the shares constituting any series of preferred stock  without any further 
table of contents vote or action by the shareholders 
the issuance of preferred stock by the board of directors could affect the rights of the holders of common stock 
for example  an issuance could result in a class of securities outstanding that would have preferences with respect to voting rights and dividends and in liquidation over the common stock  and could upon conversion or otherwise enjoy all of the rights applicable to common stock 
the authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock potentially could be used to discourage attempts by others to obtain control of us through merger  tender offer  proxy contest or otherwise by making these attempts more difficult to achieve or more costly 
the board of directors may issue the preferred stock without shareholder approval and such preferred stock could have voting and conversion rights that could materially adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common stock 
no agreements or understandings currently exist for the issuance of preferred stock  and the board of directors has no present intention to issue any preferred stock 
the board adopted a shareholder rights plan that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover of us 
the rights plan  if triggered  would make it more difficult to acquire us by  among other things  allowing existing shareholders to acquire additional shares at a substantial discount  thus substantially inhibiting the ability of an interested party to obtain control of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is in changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
approximately  and of embrex s revenues for the years ended  and  respectively  were derived from our operations outside the united states 
our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and  accordingly  changes in the exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the translation of our subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results 
from to  the british pound and euro each strengthened against the us dollar and to a lesser extent select latin american currencies also strengthened against the us dollar 
if average exchange rates during had remained the same as the average exchange rates for these currencies during the same period of  then the company s revenues would have been approximately million instead of million representing a year to year growth rate of as compared to the actual exchange adjusted growth rate of 
accumulated currency translation adjustments recorded as a separate component reduction of shareholders equity were million at december  as compared with million at december  this million change was mainly attributable to the weakening us dollar with respect to most of the currencies in which the company has an exchange rate risk 
since embrex europe is embrex s largest subsidiary  the exchange rate change between the us dollar and british pound and the british pound and the euro were the primary contributors to the million change in currency translation adjustments 
to date  the company has not utilized any derivative financial instruments or other hedging instruments to affect this exposure 
in addition to currency translation risk  the company is subject to transaction risk 
transaction risk is the risk of potential loss arising from adverse changes in exchange rates from the date invoices are issued until the receipts are collected 
most of embrex s transaction risk resides in the company s largest subsidiary  embrex europe  where accrued revenues are recorded in the functional currency  british pounds 
however  most of embrex europe s revenues are invoiced in us dollars or euros 
when revenues are collected  there is a risk that changes in the respective exchange rates could cause the amount collected when converted to british pounds to be less than originally accrued 
as of december   the company s exposure to market risk for a change in interest rates is related solely to debt outstanding under the term loan used for construction and equipping of the embrex poultry health coccidiosis vaccine manufacturing facility 
at december   variable rate debt outstanding that is exposed to fluctuations in the market rate of interest under this term loan totaled million 
the definitive extent of the company s interest rate risk under this term loan is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
based on the current balance outstanding  an increase in the libor rate of basis points would increase the company s annualized interest expense by approximately million
