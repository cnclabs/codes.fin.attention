overview the company has experienced nearly three years of suppressed earnings largely driven by the following factors the sustained low interest rate environment  the overall health of the equity markets and increased competition within its market 
however  as discussed later  the fourth quarter of has begun to reflect improvements in these factors 
the sustained low interest rate environment adversely impacts the net interest income as the company s balance sheet is structured to be both very short in duration and liquid 
management believes that liquidity and capital are necessary given the types of products and services the company offers  particularly as it relates to treasury and cash management products and services 
thus  the company does not anticipate that the structure of its balance sheet will change substantially in the near future 
the company s liquidity and capital position is designed to provide assurances that the cash needs of the company can be met 
this position adversely impacts the company s net interest income in a declining rate environment 
however  in an increasing rate environment  this position should  over time  benefit the company 
management believes that we will be entering into a period of rising interest rates given the overall expansion of the economy 
item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk discusses in detail the impact of rising and declining rates on net interest income 
net interest income is a main source of revenue for the company 
net interest income is negatively impacted by smaller spreads between the yield on earning assets and the interest free sources of funds 
as the yield on loans and investments have declined  interest free sources of funds could not  by definition  be lowered to match the decrease in yield on earning assets 
in addition  a competitive deposit pricing environment prevented the lowering of rates on interest bearing deposits to match the decrease in yields on earning assets 
during the second half of  interest rates began to rise but the repricing of funds occurred faster than the repricing of rates on loans and investments 
table appearing in the results of operations net interest 
table of contents income section of the management s discussion and analysis shows the impact of the declining rate environment and also shows the declining benefits derived from the company s interest free source of funds 
management continues to focus on diversifying its revenue sources so that the net income of the company is less susceptible to changes in interest rates 
management has also focused on reducing expenses that are not necessary to the delivery of products and services to the company s customer base 
as some of the company s fee based business is the direct result of the market value of its customer s investments  the overall health of the equity markets plays an important role in the recognition of fee income  particularly in the trust  mutual fund servicing and investment management areas of the company 
as the overall equity markets improve  the basis on which certain fee income is calculated is expected to grow 
the company is also facing increased competition from other banks in its markets as well as other competitors such as non bank financial institutions  brokers  insurance companies and investment advisory firms 
the company faces intense competition for retail customers and competes nationally with respect to its asset management business 
this increased competition continues to have the impact of compressing margins and income from the company s fee based businesses 
to counteract this competitive pressure  the company s goal is to differentiate itself from its large super regional and national competitors through superior service  attention to detail  customer knowledge and responsiveness 
management believes that the company s size should allow it to meet this goal and at the same time offer the wide range of products most customers need 
the company has experienced growth in markets outside of the kansas city metropolitan area and is developing its customer base in those outlying regions 
in particular  the company will be focusing on the st 
louis and colorado markets 
the company believes that there is demand in these markets for bank services delivered with a customer centric focus 
earnings summary the company recorded consolidated net income of million for the year ended december  this represents a decrease over net income for increased compared to earnings per share for the year ended december   were per share compared to in and in earnings per share for decreased over per share earnings  which had increased over the federal reserve board has reduced the interest rate basis points since in the second half of  the federal reserve board increased interest rates five times aggregating basis points 
this overall reduction in rates caused repricing pressures on loans and securities and thus contributed significantly to a decrease in interest income for  and into although this decrease in interest income was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense  the company s net interest income declined to million in compared to million in and million in with the five rate increases in the second half of  the company is beginning to see a turn around in its yield on earning assets as these rate increases are beginning to have a positive impact 
to illustrate the company s yield on earning assets reached a low in the first quarter of at and increased to during the fourth quarter of the company anticipates that its yields will continue to slowly improve if rates gradually rise or remain stable 
the company had a decrease of in noninterest income in as compared to and a increase in compared to this decrease of million in is due to two factors in  the company sold its merchant discount operation  which processes credit and debit card activity for commercial and retail merchants  and realized a one time gain of million 
decreases in trading  trust and investment banking income and service charges on deposit accounts in contributed to an absolute decrease in noninterest income for compared to trust income was down in primarily because of the sale of the employee benefit accounts in except for its receipt later in of the final payment on the sale of such accounts  no significant income or expenses are expected in the future with respect to employee benefit accounts 

table of contents noninterest expense declined in by compared to and decreased in by compared to the million decrease in compared to was primarily due to lower salaries and employee benefit costs as fully realized from the sale of its employee benefits business as well as other personnel related efficiencies 
this decrease in salaries and benefits was partially offset by increases in occupancy largely due to the refurbishment of the headquarters building in kansas city and the construction of new branches equipment  legal and consulting and processing fees linked to the company s upgrading of its core operating systems  and marketing expenses the company s creation of its branding strategy as well as product support 
the decrease in compared to was primarily due to lower salaries and employee benefit related costs 
results of operations net interest income net interest income is a significant source of the company s earnings and represents the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds the interest expense paid on liabilities 
the volume of interest earning assets and the related funding sources  the overall mix of these assets and liabilities and the rates paid on each  affects net interest income 
table summarizes the change in net interest income resulting from changes in volume and rates for  and table also shows the impact of the declining rate environment on net interest income over the last three years 
net interest margin is calculated as net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis fte as a percentage of average earning assets 
a critical component of net interest income and related net interest margin is the percentage of earning assets funded by interest free funding sources 
table analyzes net interest rate margin for the three years ended december   and table also shows the decline in the benefit of interest free funds as a result of the declining interest rate environment over the last three years 
net interest income  average balance sheet amounts and the corresponding yields earned and rates paid for the years through are presented in a table following the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
net interest income is presented on a tax equivalent basis to adjust for the tax exempt status of earnings from certain loans and investments  which are primarily obligations of state and local governments 

table of contents table rate volume analysis in thousands this analysis attributes changes in net interest income either to changes in average balances or to changes in average rates for earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the change in net interest income is due jointly to both volume and rate and has been allocated to volume and rate in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amount of the change in each 
all rates are presented on a tax equivalent basis and give effect to the disallowance of interest expense  for federal income tax purposes  related to certain tax free assets

these decreases in net interest income have occurred due to several factors  primarily a reduction in demand for loans due to the soft economy  a reduction in mutual fund and trust related money market balances largely driven by both economic factors and a residual lack of public confidence impacting the overall securities industry  and an earning asset portfolio that  by design  is very short in duration and has been negatively impacted by the overall decline in interest rates over the past three years 
as discussed below  management believes these factors will gradually improve 
management believes that the overall outlook in its net interest income is positive 
outstanding loans have increased from billion at the end of to billion at the end of as the economy continues to strengthen  this will spur higher demand for commercial and consumer loans 
loan related earning assets tend to have a higher spread than those earned in the company s investment portfolio  as  by design  its investment portfolio is very short in duration and liquid in its composition of assets 
in addition  as evidenced by the rate increases in  most economists believe that the federal reserve board will slowly apply the brake to the economy by increasing rates in given the term of the company s earning assets  a rising rate environment has historically had a positive impact on the company s net interest income and management expects that this will occur in the future  especially once rates stabilize 
finally  management is continuing a strategic initiative that it launched in the early part of to focus additional efforts on marketing  product enhancements and streamlining the approval process for its consumer loan product suite 
these efforts are expected to result in increased volumes of new applications and booked loans 
provision and allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses all represents management s judgment of the probable losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses is the amount necessary to adjust its all to the level considered appropriate by management 
the adequacy of the all is reviewed quarterly  considering such items as historical loss trends  a review of individual loans  current economic conditions  loan growth and characteristics  industry or segment concentration and other factors 
bank regulatory agencies require that the adequacy of the all be maintained on a bank by bank basis for each of the company s subsidiaries 
furthermore  a joint interagency advisory was issued on march   by the federal banking  thrift and credit union regulators providing clarification on the guidance on the accounting for loan and lease losses 
management estimates its probable losses in accordance with this guidance 
in  the company partially decentralized its loan approval process by increasing the lending authority limits for its regions 
however  the company maintained its centralized credit administration function  which 
table of contents provides information on affiliate bank risk levels  delinquencies  an internal ranking system and overall credit exposure 
in addition  larger loan requests are still centrally reviewed to ensure the consistent application of the loan policy and standards 
management of the company decreased the all from of total loans as of december  to of total loans as of december  this decrease was due to both a decrease in nonperforming loans in and sustained low charge offs in and in the all was increased from of total loans as of december  to of total loans as of december  this increase was due to an increase in nonperforming loans in as shown in table  the all has been allocated to various loan portfolio segments 
the company manages the all against the risk in the entire loan portfolio and therefore  the allocation of the all to a particular loan segment may change in the future 
in the opinion of management  the all is appropriate based on the inherent losses in the loan portfolio at december  although no assurance can be given  management of the company believes the present all is adequate considering the company s loss experience  delinquency trends and current economic conditions  and does not anticipate material increases in the all or in the level of provisions to the all  in the near future 
future economic conditions and borrowers ability to meet their obligations  however  are uncertainties which could affect the company s all and or need to change its current level of provision 
table allocation of allowance for loan losses in thousands this table presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan categories 
the breakdown is based on a number of qualitative factors  therefore  the amounts presented are not necessarily indicative of actual future charge offs in any particular category

fee based services provide the opportunity to offer multiple products and services to customers and  therefore  more closely align the customer with the company 
the company s ongoing focus is to develop and offer multiple products and services to its customers  the quality of which will differentiate it from the competition 
fee based services that have been emphasized include trust and securities processing  securities trading brokerage and cash management 
management believes that it can offer these products and services both efficiently and profitably as most of these are driven off of common platforms and support structures 
to further leverage these common platforms and support structures  management has developed a strategic initiative centered around developing hsa health savings account healthcare initiatives where the company provides the payment mechanisms to support these hsas which the company foresees as having an impact on the health care industry similar to that which k s have had on mutual funds 
to date  the company has entered into agreements with certain major healthcare providers 
management believes that  along with institutional asset management and mutual fund servicing  hsas have the potential to be a significant new noninterest income growth engine for the company 

table of contents table summary of noninterest income in thousands year ended december trust and securities processing trading and investment banking service charges on deposit accounts insurance fees and commissions brokerage fees bankcard fees gains on sales of securities available for sale  net other total noninterest income noninterest income summarized in table decreased in compared to an increase of in the decrease in was primarily a result of a decrease in trading and investment banking  the sale of the merchant discount operation in december which was recorded in as a one time noninterest income item  and a decline in trust income due to the one time sale of the employee benefit accounts in as the sale of the employee benefit accounts enabled the company to avoid significant capital expenditures  management believes that this sale will not have a significant impact on future earnings 
simultaneous with the sale of the merchant discount operation  a marketing agreement was executed whereby the company receives a share of future merchant discount income 
therefore  management believes that this sale will not have a significant impact on future earnings 
the growth in noninterest income in was driven primarily by the sale of the merchant discount business in december and an increase in trading and investment banking income and an increase in service charges on deposit accounts 
trust and securities processing consists of fees earned on personal and corporate trust accounts  custody of securities services  trust investments and money management services and servicing of mutual fund assets 
these fees decreased in compared to primarily because of the sale of the company s employee benefits business 
fees from mutual fund servicing increased slightly during although increased regulatory compliance costs have slowed the formation of new funds who represent potential customers of the company  there has been a growth of alternative investment products whose business is a target of the company s sales efforts 
also  the company has been able to obtain business from existing mutual funds 
the company expects this trend to continue  although it is uncertain as to the level or volume of new business it may be able to obtain or the extent that the traditional mutual fund business may change 
mergers and liquidations of equity funds appear to be slowing  but increased costs and receding margins will likely force further consolidation 
the decline in compared to was partially due to the decline in equity and financial markets as trust fees are derived from the market value of the assets in the trust 
in addition  due to the overall market decline in mutual fund volumes  fees relating to the custody of the securities and the servicing of mutual fund assets were negatively impacted 
management believes that the overall quality and performance of both its investment management and scout funds will attract both increased and new investable dollars to it assets under management 
the company also introduced a wrap product that will allow its brokerage operations to sell its scout funds to retail clients 
finally  the company has put a special emphasis on selling the scout funds through our institutional channels by the establishment of a dedicated sales force 
through the end of  this dedicated sales force has increased the net inflows into the company s scout funds primarily its worldwide and small cap funds by approximately million 
although any forecast of future growth of such funds is uncertain  it is believed the continued efforts of the sales force will positively affect such future growth 
trading and investment banking consists mostly of fees earned from the sale of bonds to the company s correspondent bank and non financial institution client base 
fees from such activity decreased million in 
table of contents compared to and as compared to an increase of million in compared to the decrease was mainly market driven as customers changed their positions of mortgaged backed securities  in  due to the heavy refinancing of real estate loans 
this returned to more normal trading levels in management intends to focus its sales efforts on increasing our correspondent bank client base in which is expected to have a positive affect on trading and investment banking income 
service charges on deposit accounts increased million in compared to and million in compared to the increase in was primarily related to an increase in overdraft and return item charges due to pricing increases and new overdraft decision and collection procedures 
these increased consumer overdraft and return item fees are expected to increase deposit service charge income  however  some of this increase will be offset by reduced consumer service charge income with the introduction of new free checking products 
commercial deposit service charge income growth slowed due to a rapid increase in earnings credits during the second half of with the possibility of more increases to the earnings credit rates in  growth in commercial service charge income could be challenged 
management believes the shift of customer payments from paper to electronic will continue at a rapid pace 
the cash management service providers that weather this environment will be those who kept pace with the technological changes and the changing nature of the payments cycle 
management is expending of its discretionary capital expenditure budget in to upgrade its product capabilities 
in addition  more targeted commission and incentive plans have been put in place to help foster more concerted sales efforts to both attract new and retain current clients 
although the company has focused significant resources into maintaining its cash management income levels  the external challenges facing the company make the impact of these changes on its income uncertain 
bankcard fees were flat in compared to and increased million in compared to merchant product revenue decreased million due to the sale of the merchant bankcard portfolio in december income from commercial credit and debit card programs grew rapidly in both and continued growth in the commercial segments and rapid transfer from offline to online debit card activity in the consumer segment is anticipated 
with the company s launch of hsas  management is expecting an increase in bankcard income within the hsa segment in other income decreased million in compared to and increased million in compared to the decrease in was largely due to the one time sale of the merchant discount operation for an million gain in partially offset by income recognized on the one time sale of the employee benefit accounts in noninterest expense noninterest expense in decreased million compared to primarily due to lower salary and benefits costs partially offset by increases in occupancy  equipment  marketing and business development  processing fees and related legal and consulting expenses 
noninterest expense decreased million in compared to due to lower equipment expenses and lower salary expenses 
the decrease in salary and benefits is primarily attributed to the reduction of employee benefit staff 
as discussed below  noninterest expense will increase in primarily due to salary and benefit expense increases 

table of contents table summary of noninterest expense in thousands year ended december salaries and employee benefits occupancy  net equipment supplies and services marketing and business development processing fees legal and consulting amortization of intangibles other total noninterest expense salaries and employee benefits declined million in compared to and decreased million in compared to the decrease in salary and benefits in were primarily the result of the savings achieved through the reduction of staffing levels due to the sale of the company s employee benefit business 
this was a continuation of the and decrease in staffing levels 
to illustrate  the company s full time equivalent employees dropped from  at year end to  at year end to  in management anticipates salary and benefit expenses to go up in as a result of a new short term incentive plan and the adoption of new accounting rules for equity based compensation related to the company s incentive stock option and long term incentive plans 
a voluntary separation plan was rolled out in january although an overall reduction in staff is anticipated as a result of this plan  the full savings associated with this plan will not be realized during the overall impact on salary expense will be dependent on the number of individuals accepting the offer 
net occupancy expense increased million or in over due largely to the amortization of costs associated with the refurbishment of a building in the company s downtown kansas city campus  as well as the construction of new branches 
occupancy remained flat in compared to additionally  rental income from our office buildings decreased significantly during whether this decrease will continue into future years depends upon the company s ability to fully lease its vacant space  and the timing and conditions of any such leases are currently unknown 
equipment costs increased million in compared to and decreased million in compared to the increase was primarily due to a million increase in software costs from upgrades to core systems during offset by a decrease in equipment depreciation 
the decrease in was a result of lower depreciation and equipment maintenance costs 
management expects these expenses to continue to increase in due to the ongoing upgrading of our core systems 
marketing and business development increased million or over due to brand positioning and product enhancement and support costs as well as increased emphasis on business development 
marketing expenses decreased by million in over management anticipates that marketing costs will decrease in due to a shift in television and other media advertising to more local community sponsorships 
processing fees increased million in compared to and increased million in compared to this increase was primarily the result of an increase in distribution fees for the scout funds as a result of increased flows into the funds and an increase in the distribution fee rate 
the increase in was due to an increase in federal reserve bank processing charges because of the decreased earnings credit on balances and increased volumes of activity 
legal and consulting fees were up million in over and were up million in over the increases were largely due to consulting costs associated with the upgrades to core systems in 
table of contents and as most core systems upgrades have occurred  management expects such consulting fees to decrease in the increase was also attributable to increased legal costs associated with the scout funds and with professional fees associated with the sarbanes oxley act of compliance 
management expects the legal and professional fees to remain flat or slightly decrease in the future 
other expense remained flat in compared to and decreased from to income taxes income tax expense totaled million in  compared to million in  and compared to million in these expense levels equate to effective rates of  and for   and respectively 
the primary reason for the difference between the company s effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate is the effect of non taxable income from municipal securities and state and federal tax credits realized 
the amount of municipal interest income received has not decreased proportionately to the decrease in the company s pretax income  causing an overall reduction in the effective tax rate for each of the three years 
the decline in the effective tax rate between and resulted mainly from a net million reduction in federal and state tax expense as a result of federal and state historic rehabilitation tax credits received on the on going renovation of a downtown kansas city office building 
the net effect of the sale of state historic rehabilitation tax credits was approximately million 
the effective income tax rate for and includes a reduction in the tax reserve resulting from a reassessment of ongoing risks associated with tax matters 
management believes that the effective tax rate will increase in as a result of a decrease in the overall impact of municipal interest income 
strategic lines of business the company s operations are strategically aligned into six major lines of business commercial banking and lending  corporate services  banking services  consumer services  asset management  and investment services group 
the lines of business in were commercial banking  retail banking  trust and wealth management  and investments services group 
this change was made by management to better reflect the current organizational structure 
this resulted in breaking commercial banking into three separate sectors commercial banking and lending  corporate services  and banking services 
this breakout was done to better reflect how the company markets its products and services as well as adding more granularity to better identify the primary drivers of our profitability 
in addition  the company merged consumer oriented business lines into the retail banking business segment and created consumer services 
finally  to reflect our desire to focus on both personal and institutional lines of business  the trust and wealth management business segment has been renamed asset management 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  the prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the reporting structure 
the lines of business are differentiated by both the customers and the products and services offered 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes how these segments are identified and presents financial results of the lines of business for the years ended december   and the treasury and other adjustments category includes items not directly associated with the other lines of business 
commercial banking and lending s pre tax net income increased million  or percent  to million in  compared to a decrease of million  or percent to million in for  the increase in net income was driven primarily by an increase in net interest margin of million or percent over this increase in margin was largely fueled by lower cost of funding million or  which was partially offset by lower average loans of million  or 
the cost of funding outstanding loans dropped from to largely driven by the company s overall lower funding costs resulting from the drop in interest rates over the past few years 
loans outstanding have dropped due to a slow economy in most of the company s footprint  increased competition and current clients and prospects having excess liquidity resulting 
table of contents in their not drawing down on lines or increasing existing lines 
a lower provision for loan losses  due to a reduction in non performing loans  also contributed to the improvement in net income 
net interest income declined in due to the sustained low interest rate environment and the corresponding impact on repricing of earning assets 
an increase in interest rates  as expected by most economists  would have the most significant impact on this business segment  causing net interest income to rise 
management also believes that an anticipated improving economy would spur an increase in both loan commitments and outstandings that would generate increased net interest income 
loan authority increases have been made in and will continually be reviewed for further increases in  which management believes should motivate and empower associates to make decisions locally and improve the turnaround time for clients 
in addition  a new bonus program is being rolled out in to reward associates for acquiring profitable business 
management anticipates that the amounts to be paid under this program will not be material 
although the intent of the plan is to increase loan volume  the effectiveness of such plan is unknown 
corporate services pre tax net income decreased million to million compared to an increase of million or percent to million in for  the decrease is largely due to lower net interest income of million 
the decline in margin is due to lower yields on deposit balances partially offset by an increase in average deposit balances of or million 
yields dropped from in to in noninterest income remained relatively flat from to  but increased by million or from to challenges for this line of business arise from competitive pressures  as well as the technological challenges due to the movement from paper to electronic processing 
management believes interest rates will continue to increase in  thus putting pressure on deposit service charge income which is impacted by earnings credits 
new products are being developed to keep the company in step with the client s changing needs 
in addition to the new products  the new business development incentive program that has been rolled out for is expected to fuel an increase in customer acquisitions and sales to existing clients 
management believes corporate trust will expand its market share in regions where the company has a physical presence outside of kansas and missouri due to an enhanced marketing emphasis 
the company has focused significant resources into maintaining its cash management income despite the external challenges facing the company from the shift in customer payments from paper to electronic form 
the impact on income from these changes is uncertain 
banking services pre tax net income was million in  a decrease of million from the net income increased by million from for  the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in noninterest income of million 
this was primarily driven by lower demand from brokerage income related to the sale of mortgage backed agencies to correspondent banks 
the noninterest income increased from due to increased demand of agency products 
banking services also saw a decline in net interest margin of million in due to a shift in the deposit mix from noninterest bearing deposits to interest bearing repurchase agreements 
if this trend continues  future increases in interest rates would have an adverse affect on interest margin 
management believes that reorganizing the banking services group around delivering major umb product sets through its community bank relationships should improve income within this segment 
consumer services pre tax net income decreased million to a net loss of million  compared to a decrease of million from to consumer services is a source of funding for other activities within the company 
due to the competitive nature of deposit pricing within the company s markets  the company s affiliates and subsidiaries increased deposit rates at a higher pace than its increases in earning asset yields during the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in net interest income before provision of million or from net interest income is lower because of a million decrease  or drop in average retail branch deposits from to  combined with a higher rate of interest paid on deposits during the majority of the decline in deposits was from time deposits 
growth was experienced in interest checking  savings and regular checking accounts during the decrease in net interest income was partially offset by lower provision for loan loss expense due to sustained lower charge offs  as well as an increase in noninterest income 
noninterest income increased during primarily as a result of higher deposit service 
table of contents charge income due to new overdraft decision and collection procedures 
this was partially offset by a decrease in atm interchange income due to overall reduced volume 
management believes that consumer services will improve net interest margin in by growing noninterest bearing deposits with the introduction of a free checking product and redesigning in a deposit product set 
further  variable rate consumer loan products such as home equity lines of credit will be a focus in this rising interest rate environment 
management believes that noninterest expense will increase in as a result of planned new branch openings and expansions and will evaluate operational efficiencies and branch realignment to offset such expenses 
asset management s pre tax net income was million  which is a decrease of million or from this is compared to a million increase in income from to the million increase in noninterest income from to was offset by a million increase in noninterest expense 
noninterest income increased as a result of increased inflows into the scout funds  in particular the umb scout worldwide and umb scout small cap funds which grew by over million and million  respectively 
noninterest expense also increased related to increases in distribution  accounting and administration fees from the funds 
another significant expense in was the related to the amortization of a new trust system placed in service in february management believes that income will increase as it continues to focus its marketing efforts on increasing the inflows into the scout funds 
total assets under management for the umb scout funds are over billion as of december  investment services group s net income decreased million or percent to million in  compared to a decrease of to million in from for  the decrease is due to a decline in net interest income and an increase in noninterest expense 
net interest income declined due to a reduction of deposits from mutual fund clients 
the noninterest expense increased by million in over primarily because of increased personnel costs and credits received in for  decreased revenues related to a sluggish mutual fund industry had the greatest impact on earnings 
management believes that income from new customers added in are expected to result in increased revenues in  subject to the overall uncertainties within the mutual fund industry and the overall health of the equity markets 
the net loss for the treasury and other adjustments category was million for  compared to a net loss of million for the net loss for all years includes unallocated income tax expense for the consolidated company 
the smaller loss in was due primarily to the gain on the one time sale of the merchant discount processing activity that appears as noninterest income in this is partially offset by income from the one time sale of the employee benefits accounts during and decreased income tax expense as a result of federal and state rehabilitation tax credits 
balance sheet analysis loans loans represent the company s largest source of interest income 
loan balances increased by million in due to management s effort to focus on new commercial and consumer loan relationships  as well as the overall improvement in the economy 
management plans to continue to focus on growing our consumer and middle market business as these market niches represent our best opportunity to cross sell fee related services  such as cash management 
additionally  management has implemented a new incentive plan for loan officers  as well as increased the loan authority for the regional presidents 
included in table is a five year breakdown of loans by type 
during the first quarter of the company reviewed the classifications of loans to ensure that loans were properly recorded on the loan system  which resulted in the reclassification of million in loans from the commercial category to the commercial real estate category 
business related loans continue to represent the largest segment of the company s loan portfolio  comprising approximately of total loans

bankcard loans have increased slightly as a percentage of total loans 
the increase in was due primarily to increased promotional activity  for which the continued impact of such activities is unknown 
a significant portion of the decrease in volume of bankcard loans in and was caused by a reduction in the private label portion of the portfolio 
this type of loan is generally less profitable than traditional bankcard loans and is likely to continue to decrease in volume 
other consumer installment loans have decreased as a percentage of loans 
future loan volumes may be affected by the competitive environment including financing terms from auto makers  the overall economy and consumer debt levels 
the effects of such factors are uncertain 
real estate residential loans have increased as a percentage of loans 
the increase was due to the success of a low rate home equity line promotion and product enhancements

securities the company s security portfolio provides liquidity as a result of the composition and average life of the underlying securities 
this liquidity can be used to fund loan growth or to offset the outflow of traditional funding sources 
in addition to providing a potential source of liquidity  the security portfolio can be used as a tool to manage interest rate sensitivity 
the company s goal in the management of its securities portfolio is to maximize return within the company s parameters of liquidity goals  interest rate risk and credit risk 
the company maintains very high liquidity levels while investing in only high grade securities 
the security portfolio generates the company s second largest component of interest income 
securities available for sale and securities held to maturity comprised of earning assets as of december   compared to at year end securities totaled billion at december   compared to billion at year end loan demand is expected to be the primary factor impacting changes in the level of security holdings 
securities available for sale comprised of the company s securities portfolio at december  compared to at year end in order to improve the yields of the securities portfolio the company has altered the mix of the portfolio from us treasury notes to mortgage backed securities of us agencies and state and political subdivisions 
securities available for sale had a net unrealized loss of million at year end  compared to a gain of million the preceding year 
these amounts are reflected  on an after tax basis  in the company s other comprehensive income in shareholders equity  net of tax  as an unrealized loss of million at year end  compared to a gain of million for the securities portfolio achieved an average yield on a tax equivalent basis of for  compared to in and in the yield on the portfolio decreased by basis points in as a result of low  sustained short term interest rates 
a significant portion of the investment portfolio must be reinvested each year as a result of its liquidity 
the average life of the securities portfolio was months at december  compared to months at year end management has adopted a portfolio modification plan designed to improve noninterest margin which it intends to implement over the course of the next two years 
this plan calls for a modest extension of months  to the portfolio average life 
implementation of this plan is subject to market conditions including sufficient supply of securities with acceptable risk reward characteristics 
the effectiveness of this plan is uncertain as it is dependent on future market conditions including interest rate changes 
included in tables and are analyses of the cost  fair value and average yield tax equivalent basis of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity 
the securities portfolio contains securities that have unrealized losses and are not deemed to be other than temporarily impaired see the table of these securities in footnote on page of this document 
there are us treasury obligations  federal agency mortgage backed securities  and municipal securities that have had unrealized losses for greater than months 
these unrealized losses are a result of interest rate volatility in the markets and not related to the credit quality of the investments 
the company had the ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value is achieved  which may be maturity 
therefore  management does not consider these securities to be other than temporarily impaired at december

risk based capital guidelines established by regulatory agencies establish minimum capital standards based on the level of risk associated with a financial institution s assets 
a financial institution s total capital is required to equal at least of risk weighted assets 
at least half of that must consist of tier core capital  and the remainder may be tier supplementary capital 
the risk based capital guidelines indicate the specific risk weightings by type of asset 
certain off balance sheet items such as standby letters of credit and binding loan commitments are multiplied by credit conversion factors to translate them into balance sheet equivalents before assigning them specific risk weightings 
due to the company s high level of core capital and substantial portion of earning assets invested in government securities  the tier capital ratio of and total capital ratio of substantially exceed the regulatory minimums

the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to customers and suppliers  allowance for loan losses  bad debts  investments  financing operations  long lived assets  taxes  other contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which have formed the basis for making such judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from the recorded estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents management believes that the company s critical accounting policies are those relating to allowance for loan losses  goodwill and other intangibles  impairment of long lived assets  revenue recognition  and  accounting for stock based compensation 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s judgment of the losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
the adequacy is reviewed quarterly  considering such items as historical trends  a review of individual loans  current economic conditions  loan growth and characteristics 
the allowance for loan losses are maintained on a bank by bank basis  however  the company uses a centralized credit administration function  which provides information on affiliate bank risk levels  delinquencies  and internal ranking systems 
goodwill is tested periodically for impairment 
the company has performed three impairment tests of goodwill since inception of the new standard 
as a result of those tests  the company has not recorded an impairment charge 
the company is amortizing other intangibles over their estimated useful life of years 
long lived assets including goodwill  other intangible assets and premises and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or a group of assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill and other intangibles were addressed above 
the impairment review for long lived assets other than goodwill includes a comparison of future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or group of assets to their current carrying value 
if the carrying value of the asset or group of assets exceeds expected cash flows undiscounted and with interest charges  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds its fair value 
revenue recognition is the recording of interest on loans and securities and is recognized based on rate multiplied by the principal amount outstanding 
interest accrual is discontinued when  in the opinion of management  the likelihood of collection becomes doubtful 
annual bankcard fees are recognized on a straight line basis over the period that cardholders may use the card 
other noninterest income is recognized as services are performed or revenue generating transactions are executed 
stock based compensation is recognized using the intrinsic value method for disclosure purposes 
pursuant to the requirements of fas proforma net income and earnings per share are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements and discloses the impact on earnings as if the fair value method had been applied 
please see the discussion on fas r issued december   under note  new accounting pronouncements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under item on pages and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management market risk is a broad term for the risk of economic loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument 
these changes may be the result of various factors  including interest rates  foreign exchange prices  commodity prices or equity prices 
financial instruments that are subject to market risk can be classified either as held for trading or held for purposes other than trading 
the company is subject to market risk primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates of its assets held for purposes other than trading 
the following discussion of interest risk  however  combines instruments held for trading and instruments held for purposes other than trading because the instruments held for trading represent such a small portion of the company s portfolio that the interest rate risk associated with them is immaterial 
interest rate risk in the banking industry  a major risk exposure is changing interest rates 
to minimize the effect of interest rate changes to net interest income and exposure levels to economic losses  the company manages its exposure to 
table of contents changes in interest rates through asset and liability management within guidelines established by its funds management committee fmc and approved by the company s board of directors 
the fmc has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with asset liability management policies  including interest rate exposure 
the company uses the following methods simulation tools for measuring and analyzing consolidated interest rate risk market value of equity modeling net portfolio value  net interest income simulation analysis  and repricing mismatch analysis 
the company does not use hedges or swaps to manage interest rate risk except for the use of futures contracts to offset interest rate risk on specific securities held in its trading portfolio 
market value of equity net portfolio value modeling the company uses the net portfolio value to measure and manage interest rate sensitivity 
the net portfolio value measures the degree to which the market values of the company s assets and liabilities will change given a change in interest rates 
this model is designed to represent  as of the respective date selected  the increase or decrease in the market value of assets and liabilities that would result from a hypothetical change in interest rates on such date 
the company uses a hypothetical rate change rate shock of basis points and basis points  up or down 
to perform these calculations  the company uses the current loan  investment and deposit portfolios 
the company then makes certain cash flow assumptions regarding non maturity deposits based on historical analysis  and management s outlook 
the company also analyzes loan prepayments and other market risks from industry estimates of prepayments and other market changes 
given the low level of current interest rates  the down basis point scenario could not be completed as of december  table sets forth  for december  and  the increase or decrease as applicable in net portfolio value  that would be caused by the following hypothetical immediate changes in interest rates on such date an immediate increase of basis points  an immediate increase of basis points  an immediate decrease of basis points  and  an immediate decrease of basis points 
table includes both instruments entered into for trading purposes  and the instruments entered into for other than trading purposes  since the former represents such a small portion of the company s portfolio that any difference in the interest rate risk associated with it as compared with the risk associated with instruments entered into for other than trading purposes is immaterial 
net portfolio value as of december  is higher than december  at both the and basis points increases 
this is due primarily to a modeling change in which longer term non maturity deposit cash flows are now being discounted with a longer term wholesale funding replacement versus in the past where they were discounted with a short term wholesale funding replacement rate 
the company is indicated to benefit from rate increases because a majority of its earnings assets are shorter in duration that its deposits have been repriced 
also  the company had higher loans at december  than december  the indicated benefit from rising rate on npv may not necessarily translate into improved earnings over the near term 
table market risk in thousands rates in basis points rate shock net portfolio value december  december  amount change change amount change change static net interest income modeling another tool used to measure interest rate risk and the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income and net interest margin is net interest income simulation analysis 
this analysis incorporates substantially all of 
table of contents the company s assets and liabilities together with forecasted changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment 
through these simulations management estimates the impact on net interest income of a basis point upward or downward gradual change of market interest rates over a one year period 
assumptions are made to project rates for new loans and deposits based on historical analysis  management outlook and repricing strategies 
asset prepayments and other market risks are developed from industry estimates of prepayment speeds and other market changes 
since the results of these simulations can be significantly influenced by assumptions utilized  management evaluates the sensitivity of the simulation results to changes in assumptions 
due to the low level of interest rates  the scenarios that simulate a basis point and a basis point decrease could not be completed as of december  table shows the net interest income increase or decrease over the next twelve months as of december  and both years show that if rates rise or basis points  net interest income will increase 
table market risk in thousands net interest income rates in basis points rate shock december  amount of change december  amount of change static repricing mismatch analysis the company also evaluates its interest rate sensitivity position in an attempt to maintain a balance between the amount of interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities which are expected to mature or reprice at any point in time 
while a traditional repricing mismatch analysis gap analysis provides a snapshot of interest rate risk  it does not take into consideration that assets and liabilities with similar repricing characteristics may not in fact reprice at the same time or the same degree 
also  it does not necessarily predict the impact of changes in general levels of interest rates on net interest income 
management attempts to structure the balance sheet to provide for the repricing of approximately equal amounts of assets and liabilities within specific time intervals 
table is a static gap analysis  which presents the company s assets and liabilities  based on their repricing or maturity characteristics 
this analysis shows that the company is in a positive gap position because assets maturing or repricing exceed liabilities

table of contents trading account the company s subsidiary umb bank  na carries taxable governmental securities in a trading account that is maintained according to a board approved policy and relevant procedures 
the policy limits the amount and type of securities that can be carried in the trading account as well as requiring that any limits under applicable law and regulations also be complied with  and mandates the use of a value at risk methodology to manage price volatility risks within financial parameters 
the risk associated with the carrying of trading securities is offset by the sale of exchange traded financial futures contracts  with both the trading account and futures contracts marked to market daily 
this account had a balance of million as of december  compared to million as of december  the manager of the investment banking division of umb bank  na presents documentation of the methodology used in determining value at risk at least annually to the board for approval in compliance with occ banking circular  risk management of financial derivatives  and other banking laws and regulations 
the aggregate value at risk is reviewed quarterly 
the aggregate value at risk in the trading account was negligible as of december  and other market risk the company does not have material commodity price risks or derivative risks 
credit risk credit risk represents the risk that a customer or counterparty may not perform in accordance with contractual terms 
credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers 
the company utilizes a centralized credit administration function  which provides information on affiliate bank risk levels  delinquencies  an internal ranking system and overall credit exposure 
in addition  loan requests are centrally reviewed to insure the consistent application of the loan policy and standards 
in addition  the company has an internal loan review staff that operates independently of the affiliate banks 
this review team performs periodic examinations of each bank s loans for credit quality  documentation and loan administration 
the respective regulatory authority of each affiliate bank also reviews loan portfolios 
another means of ensuring loan quality is diversification of the portfolio 
by keeping its loan portfolio diversified  the company has avoided problems associated with undue concentrations of loans within particular industries 
commercial real estate loans comprise only of total loans  with no history of significant losses 
the company has no significant exposure to highly leveraged transactions and has no foreign credits in its loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses  all is discussed on pages and also  please see table for a five year analysis of the all 
the adequacy of the all is reviewed quarterly  considering such items as historical loss trends  a review of individual loans  current economic conditions  loan growth and characteristics  industry or segment concentration and other factors 
a primary indicator of credit quality and risk management is the level of nonperforming loans 
nonperforming loans include both nonaccrual loans and restructured loans 
the company s nonperforming loans decreased million at december   compared to an increase of million a year earlier 
the major portion of nonperforming loans is due to three commercial loan customers 
the company s nonperforming loans have not exceeded of total loans in any of the last five years 
while the company plans to increase its loan portfolio  management does not intend to compromise the company s high credit standards as it grows its loan portfolio 
the impact of future loan growth on the allowance for loan losses is uncertain as it is dependent on many factors including asset quality and changes in the overall economy 

table of contents the company has no other real estate owned as of december   compared to  at december  loans past due more than days totaled million at december  compared to million at december  a loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when payments are past due days or more and or when management has considerable doubt about the borrower s ability to repay on the terms originally contracted 
the accrual of interest is discontinued and recorded thereafter only when actually received in cash 
certain loans are restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal due to deterioration in the financial condition of the respective borrowers 
in  there was no reduction or deferral of interest due 
the company had no restructured loans at december   compared to  at december  table loan quality in thousands december nonaccrual loans restructured loans total nonperforming loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets loans past due days or more reserve for loans losses ratios nonperforming loans as a of loans nonperforming assets as a of loans plus other real estate owned nonperforming assets as a of total assets loans past due days or more as a of loans reserve for loan losses as a of loans reserve for loan losses as a multiple of nonperforming loans x x x x x liquidity risk liquidity represents the company s ability to meet financial commitments through the maturity and sale of existing assets or availability of additional funds 
the company believes that the most important factor in the preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that facilitates the retention and growth of a large  stable supply of core deposits and wholesale funds 
ultimately  public confidence is generated through profitable operations  sound credit quality and a strong capital position 
the primary source of liquidity for the company is regularly scheduled payments on and maturity of assets  which include billion of high quality securities available for sale 
the liquidity of the company and its affiliate banks is also enhanced by its activity in the federal funds market and by its core deposits 
neither the company nor its subsidiaries are active in the debt market 
the traditional funding source for the company s subsidiary banks has been core deposits 
the company has not issued any debt since when million of medium term notes were issued to fund bank acquisitions 
prior to being paid off in february  these notes were rated a by moody s investor service and a by standard and poor s 
based upon regular contact with investment banking firms  management is confident in its ability to raise debt or equity capital on favorable terms  should the need arise 

table of contents the company also has other commercial commitments that may impact liquidity 
these commitments include unused commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and financial guarantees  and commercial letters of credit 
the total amount of these commercial commitments at december  was billion 
the company believes that since many of these commitments expire without being drawn upon  the total amount of these commercial commitments does not necessarily represent the future cash requirements of the company 
the company s cash requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders  debt service and treasury stock purchases 
management fees and dividends received from subsidiary banks traditionally have been sufficient to satisfy these requirements and are expected to be sufficient in the future 
the company s subsidiary banks are subject to various rules regarding payment of dividends to the company 
for the most part  all banks can pay dividends at least equal to their current year s earnings without seeking prior regulatory approval 
from time to time  approvals have been requested to allow a subsidiary bank to pay a dividend in excess of its current earnings 
all such requests have been approved 
operational risk the company is exposed to numerous types of operational risk 
operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from the company s operations  including  but not limited to the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside the company  the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees or others  errors relating to transaction processing and systems  and breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements 
this risk of loss also includes the potential legal or regulatory actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency  or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards 
included in the legal and regulatory issues with which the company must comply are a number of recently imposed rules resulting from the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of the company operates in many markets and places reliance on the ability of its employees and systems to properly process a high number of transactions 
in the event of a breakdown in the internal control systems  improper operation of systems or improper employee actions  the company could suffer financial loss  face regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation 
in order to address this risk  management maintains a system of internal controls with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and execution  safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft  and ensuring the reliability of financial and other data 
the company maintains systems of controls that provide management with timely and accurate information about the company s operations 
these systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate levels given the company s financial strength  the environment in which it operates  and considering factors such as competition and regulation 
the company has also established procedures that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct  ethics and business practices are followed on a uniform basis 
in certain cases  the company has experienced losses from operational risk 
such losses have included the effects of operational errors that the company has discovered and included as expense in the statement of income 
while there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer such losses in the future  management continually monitors and works to improve its internal controls  systems and corporate wide processes and procedures
