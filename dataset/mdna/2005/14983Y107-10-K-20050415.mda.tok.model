restructuring of senior notes debt on january   the company completed a  private placement of senior subordinated notes the senior notes and warrants with three financial institutions 
the senior notes originally bore interest at per annum and are subordinate to all senior debt including the company s fleet facility 
for a description of the fleet facility  see liquidity and capital resources 
under the terms of the senior notes  as amended  the company was required to maintain certain financial ratios and comply with other financial conditions contained in the senior notes agreement 
at march   the company owed  on the senior notes 
on april   an agreement was reached among the company  the original noteholders and the investors as to the financial restructuring of the senior notes 
the original noteholders agreed to convert a portion of the existing debt due from cd l into equity and to modify the terms of the senior notes if the investors purchased a portion of the notes and accepted similar modifications 
the nature of the restructuring is as follows a the original noteholders exchanged senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of  for shares of the series a convertible redeemable preferred stock of the company  par value 
per share preferred stock  with a liquidation preference of  the preferred stock is convertible into  shares of common stock  does not pay dividends unless dividends are declared and paid on the common stock and is redeemable by the company for the liquidation value 
the conversion price is per share which was equal to the average closing price for the company s common stock for the days prior to the closing 
holders of the preferred stock have the right to elect two directors 
b the original noteholders and the company amended the terms of the  balance of the senior notes  and then exchanged the amended notes for the new notes  which consist of two series of convertible notes  the series a convertible subordinated notes the series a convertible notes in the principal amount of  and the series b convertible subordinated notes series b convertible notes in the principal amount of  collectively  the convertible notes 
the loan agreement that governed the senior notes was amended and restated to reflect the terms of the substituted series a convertible notes and the series b convertible notes  including the elimination of most financial covenants 
the principal amount of the convertible notes is due in a balloon payment at the maturity date of april  the convertible notes bear interest at a rate of for the first two years of the term  for the next two years and for the final three years of the term and will be paid quarterly 
the terms of the two series of convertible notes are identical except for the conversion price for the series a convertible notes  the average closing price for the company s common stock for the days prior to the closing and for the series b convertible notes 
c the investors purchased the series a convertible notes from the original noteholders for a price of  d the company issued an additional  of series a convertible notes to the investors for an additional payment of  the proceeds of which were used to reduce short term debt 
e the investors  the original noteholders and the company entered into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which the shares of the company s common stock issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock and the convertible notes may be registered for resale with the securities and exchange commission sec 
the company cannot be compelled to redeem the preferred stock for cash at any time 
as the interest on the convertible notes increases over the term of the convertible notes  the company records the associated interest expense on a straight line basis  giving rise to accrued interest over the early term of the convertible notes 
as a result of the debt restructuring described above  the company has taken a charge of  recorded in other expense in the second quarter of  representing the unamortized balance of the original issue discount and deferred financing costs related to the original private placement of the senior notes 
costs incurred relative to the aforementioned transactions amounted to approximately  of this amount   has been accounted for as deferred financing costs and is being amortized over the term of the new financing agreements 
the remaining  has been accounted for as a reduction in paid in capital 
these amounts have been allocated based on the proportion of debt to equity raised in the aforementioned transactions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  intangible assets  insurance reserves  income taxes and contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make payments when due or within a reasonable period of time thereafter 
the company estimates allowances for doubtful accounts by evaluating past due aging trends  analyzing customer payment histories and assessing market conditions relating to its customers operations and financial condition 
such allowances are developed principally for specific customers 
as of december   the company has estimated that an allowance for doubtful accounts of  is needed to cover the current receivable base 
as a result of this estimate  the company recorded  of expense in related to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  additional allowances may be required 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
the company interprets the timing of revenue recognition to be when services are rendered to customers  and expenses are recognized as incurred 
this policy applies to all of the company s same day  time critical delivery service options  including rush  scheduled  facilities management and dedicated contract logistics 
certain customers pay in advance  giving rise to deferred revenue 
this policy is consistent with prior years and as such  the increase in revenue from relates solely to additional sales volume 
goodwill the value of the company s goodwill is significant relative to total assets and stockholders equity 
the company reviews goodwill for impairment on  at least  an annual basis using several fair value based tests  which include  among others  a discounted cash flow and terminal value computation as well as comparing the company s market capitalization to the book value of the company 
the discounted cash flow and terminal value computation is based on management s estimates of future operations 
during  an annual impairment test was performed and the company determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
as such  there was no impact on the statement of operations related to goodwill 
changes in business conditions or interest rates could materially impact management s estimates of future operations and consequently the company s evaluation of fair value  and this could result in an impairment of goodwill 
such impairment  if any  could have a significant impact on the company s reported results from future operations and financial condition 
examples of changes in business conditions include  but are not limited to  bankruptcy or loss of a significant customer  a significant adverse change in regulatory factors  a loss of key personnel  increased levels of competition from companies with greater financial resources than the company and margin erosion caused by the company s inability to increase prices to its customers at the same rate as that of the associated cost increases 
insurance reserves the company insures certain of its risks through insurance policies  but retains risk as a result of its deductibles related to such insurance policies 
the company s deductible for workers compensation is  per loss 
the deductible for employee health medical costs is  per loss 
effective july   automobile liability coverage is maintained for covered vehicles through a fully insured indemnity program with no deductible 
the company reserves the estimated amounts of uninsured claims and deductibles related to such insurance retentions for claims that have occurred in the normal course of business 
these reserves are established by management based upon the recommendations of third party administrators who perform a specific review of open claims  which include fully developed estimates of both reported claims and incurred but not reported claims  as of the balance sheet date 
actual claim settlements may differ materially from these estimated reserve amounts 
as of december   the company has accrued approximately  for estimated losses incurred but not reported 
the company has also accrued  for incurred but unpaid employee health medical costs as of december income taxes the company files income tax returns in every jurisdiction in which it has reason to believe it is subject to tax 
historically  the company has been subject to examination by various taxing jurisdictions 
to date  none of these examinations has resulted in any material additional tax 
nonetheless  any tax jurisdiction may contend that a filing position claimed by the company regarding one or more of its transactions is contrary to that jurisdiction s laws or regulations

management believes that cash flows from operations and its borrowing capacity are sufficient to support the company s operations and general business and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
such conclusions are predicated upon sufficient cash flows from operations and the continued availability of a revolving credit facility 
the risks associated with cash flows from operations are mitigated by the company s low gross profit margin 
unless extraordinary  decreases in revenue should be accompanied by corresponding decreases in costs  resulting in minimal impact to liquidity 
the risks associated with the revolving credit facility are as discussed above
