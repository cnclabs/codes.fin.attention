these swaps mitigate the risk of changes in the fair value of million of five year senior notes attributable to changes in libor 
for accounting purposes  the difference between the fixed rate received and the libor rate paid on the notional amount of the swap is recorded as interest expense on the company s consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  the company adjusts the value of the swap to its fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged liability by an offsetting amount on a quarterly basis 
during  the company entered into two day forward starting swaps each having a million notional amount 
these pay fixed swaps which were effective in september  had rates of and  had seven year and ten year terms  respectively  and were used to lock in swap rates related to a portion of planned future corporate unsecured fixed rate bond issuances

in connection with stars  series in may  the company entered into a libor interest rate cap struck at in the notional amount of million  and simultaneously sold a libor interest rate cap with the same terms 
since these instruments do not change the company s net interest rate risk exposure  they do not qualify as hedges and changes in their respective values are charged to earnings 
as the terms of these arrangements are substantially the same  the effects of a revaluation of these two instruments substantially offset one another 
in connection with stars  series in may  the company entered into a libor interest rate cap struck at in the notional amount of million 
the company utilizes the provisions of sfas no 
with respect to such instruments 
sfas no 
provides that the up front fees paid on option based products such as caps should be expensed into earnings based on the allocation of the premium to the affected periods as if the agreement were a series of caplets 
these allocated premiums are then reflected as a charge to income as part of interest expense in the affected period 
on may   in connection with the stars  series transaction  the company paid a premium of million for this interest rate cap 
using the caplet methodology discussed above  amortization of the cap premium is dependent upon the actual value of the caplets at inception 
during the year ended december   the company refinanced its million term loan maturing march  with a million term loan maturing march  the term loan bears interest at per annum  payable monthly  and amortizes over an approximately year schedule 
the term loan represented forecasted transactions for which the company had previously entered into us treasury based hedging transactions 
the net million cost of the settlement of such hedges has been deferred and is being amortized as an increase to the effective financing cost of the term loan over its effective ten year term 
credit risk concentrations concentrations of credit risks arise when a number of borrowers or customers related to the company s investments are engaged in similar business activities  or activities in the same geographic region  or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations  including those to the company  to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions 
the company regularly monitors various segments of its portfolio to assess potential concentrations of credit risks 
management believes the current portfolio is reasonably well diversified and does not contain any unusual concentration of credit risks 
substantially all of the company s ctl assets including those held by joint ventures and loans and other lending investments are collateralized by facilities located in the united states  with significant concentrations ie  greater than as of december  in california 
as of december   the company s investments also contain greater than concentrations in the following asset types office ctl  industrial  office lending and entertainment leisure 
the company underwrites the credit of prospective borrowers and customers and often requires them to provide some form of credit support such as corporate guarantees  letters of credit and or cash security deposits 
although the company s loans and other lending investments and corporate customer lease assets are geographically diverse and the borrowers and customers operate in a variety of industries  to the extent the company has a significant concentration of interest or operating lease revenues from any single borrower or customer  the inability of that borrower or customer to make its payment could have an adverse effect on the company

because no shares had been issued prior to march   dividends received on these phantom shares were reflected as compensation expense by the company 
for accounting purposes  this arrangement was treated as a contingent  variable plan and no additional compensation expense was recognized until the shares became irrevocably vested on march   at which time the company reflected a charge equal to the fair value of the shares irrevocably vested 
in addition  during the year ended december   the company entered into a three year employment agreement with its former president 
under the agreement  in lieu of salary and bonus  the company granted the executive  restricted shares 
these shares became fully vested on september  as a result of the company achieving a total shareholder rate of return dividends plus share price appreciation since january  upon the restricted shares becoming fully vested  the company withheld  of such shares from the executive to cover the tax obligations associated with the vesting of such shares

high performance unit program in may  the company s shareholders approved the istar financial high performance unit hpu program 
the program  as more fully described in the company s annual proxy statement dated april   is a performance based employee compensation plan that only has material value to the participants if the company provides superior returns to its shareholders 
the program entitles the employee participants hpu holders to receive distributions in the nature of common stock dividends if the total rate of return on the company s common stock share price appreciation plus dividends exceeds certain performance levels 
initially  there were three plans within the program the plan  the plan  and the plan 
each plan has  shares of high performance common stock associated with it 
each share of high performance common stock carries votes per share 
for these three plans  the company s performance is measured over a one  two  or three year valuation period  beginning on january  and ending on december   december  and december   respectively 
the end of the valuation period ie  the valuation date will be accelerated if there is a change in control of the company 
the high performance common stock has a nominal value unless the total rate of shareholder return for the relevant valuation period exceeds the greater of   or for the plan  the plan and the plan  respectively  and a weighted industry index total rate of return consisting of equal weightings of the russell financial index and the morgan stanley reit index for the relevant period

if the total rate of return on the company s common stock does not exceed the threshold performance levels for a particular plan  then the shares of high performance common stock related to that plan will have only nominal value 
in this event  each of the  shares will be entitled to dividends equal to times the dividend paid on a share of common stock  if and when dividends are declared on the common stock 
regardless of how much the company s total rate of return exceeds the threshold performance levels  the dilutive impact to the company s shareholders resulting from distributions on high performance common stock in each plan is limited to the equivalent of of the average monthly number of fully diluted shares of the company s common stock outstanding during the valuation period

as a result of this superior performance  the participants in the plan are entitled to receive distributions equivalent to the amount of dividends payable on  shares of the company s common stock  as and when such dividends are paid 
such dividend payments began with the first quarter dividend 
the company will pay dividends on the plan shares in the same amount per equivalent share and on the same distribution dates that shares of the company s common stock are paid

note fair values of financial instruments sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments sfas no 
 requires the disclosure of the estimated fair values of financial instruments 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
quoted market prices  if available  are utilized as estimates of the fair values of financial instruments 
because no quoted market prices exist for a significant part of the company s financial instruments  the fair values of such instruments have been derived based on management s assumptions  the amount and timing of future cash flows and estimated discount rates 
the estimation methods for individual classifications of financial instruments are described more fully below 
different assumptions could significantly affect these estimates 
accordingly  the net realizable values could be materially different from the estimates presented below 
the provisions of sfas no 
do not require the disclosure of the fair value of non financial instruments  including intangible assets or the company s ctl assets 
in addition  the estimates are only indicative of the value of individual financial instruments and should not be considered an indication of the fair value of the company as an operating business 
short term financial instruments the carrying values of short term financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents and short term investments approximate the fair values of these instruments 
these financial instruments generally expose the company to limited credit risk and have no stated maturities  or have an average maturity of less than days and carry interest rates which approximate market 
loans and other lending investments for the company s interests in loans and other lending investments  the fair values were estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows excluding participation interests in the sale or refinancing proceeds of the underlying collateral using estimated current market rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the same remaining maturities 
marketable securities securities held for investment  securities available for sale  loans held for sale  trading account instruments  long term debt and trust preferred securities traded actively in the secondary market have been valued using quoted market prices 
other financial instruments the carrying value of other financial instruments including  restricted cash  accrued interest receivable  accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate the fair values of the instruments 
debt obligations a portion of the company s existing debt obligations bear interest at fixed margins over libor 
such margins may be higher or lower than those at which the company could currently replace the related financing arrangements 
other obligations of the company bear interest at fixed rates  which may differ from prevailing market interest rates 
as a result  the fair values of the company s debt obligations were estimated by discounting current debt balances from december  and to maturity using estimated current market rates at which the company could enter into similar financing arrangements 
interest rate protection agreements the fair value of interest rate protection agreements such as interest rate caps  floors  collars and swaps used for hedging purposes see note is the estimated amount the company would receive or pay to terminate these agreements at the reporting date  taking into account current interest rates and current creditworthiness of the respective counterparties
