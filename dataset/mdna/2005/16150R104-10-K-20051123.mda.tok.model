loss on impairment of goodwill as discussed in the notes of the company s consolidated financial statements  in fiscal year  the company recorded a  charge related to the impairment of goodwill in connection with its sale of sunburst 
goodwill related to sunburst  having a pre impairment book value of  was written down to its fair value of  which was realized upon the december  sale of sunburst 
the impairment was recorded in the company s first fiscal quarter ended november  while the effective date of the sale of sunburst was december  interest expense interest expense was  in fiscal compared to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the change in interest expense is a direct result of rising interest rates over the past twelve months 
additionally  increases in the company s outstanding debt primarily related to the following items contributed to the increased interest expense in fiscal a the december repurchase of common stock  b the december acquisition of paper tyger  c the january acquisition of manufacturing equipment located in taylorsville  north carolina and d the april acquisition of e poxy 
the increase in interest expense was offset by the company s ability to reduce overall debt balances through principal payments from operating cash flow 
the company anticipates an increase to interest expense in fiscal due in part to its loan agreement related to the acquisition of concoat holdings limited 
the company expects to continue to pay down its debt through operating cash flow in fiscal and receive the benefits from favorable borrowing rates from its financial institutions 
other income expense other income increased  to  for the year ended august  compared to an expense of  in the prior year 
the increase in fiscal year is primarily a result of monthly rental income of  on property building and land owned by the company and leased to sunburst under a month rental agreement entered into in conjunction with the company s sale of sunburst 
other expense in the year ended august  also included  related to foreign currency translation loss which was realized upon the closing of the company s canadian facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal year income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
in all three years  the company has received the benefit of strong export sales and foreign tax credits 
in fiscal  the sale of sunburst created a capital loss carryforward for income tax purposes of approximately million 
this capital loss expires in and will be used to offset any capital gains generated by the company in future periods 
at the time of the sale of sunburst  management concluded that it was more likely than not that the company would not realize the benefit of this capital loss carryforward and thus this deferred tax asset was offset by a full valuation allowance 
accordingly  the company s annual fiscal effective income tax rate reflects this valuation allowance in the form of a higher effective tax rate compared to the current year period 
although the company continues to look for opportunities that will generate capital gains and enable it to utilize this deferred tax asset  as of august   management continues to believe that it is more likely than not that the company will not realize the benefit of this capital loss carryforward 
income before minority interest income before minority interest decreased  or to  in fiscal compared to  in the prior year and decreased  or in fiscal compared to  in fiscal income loss from unconsolidated joint venture the income loss from unconsolidated joint venture relates to a equity position in the stewart group  inc sgi  located in toronto  canada

of canada  to produce various products for the fiber optic cable market 
in accordance with the company s accounting policies  the carrying value of this investment was reviewed periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable and impairment may exist 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  an impairment of  related to the company s investment in sgi was recorded due to changes in sgi s projected future cash flows due to the expected future loss of a key customer 
this impairment charge was determined based upon an updated understanding of sgi s businesses through discussions with sgi s majority shareholder as well as an analysis of sgi s projected future cash flows

the higher cash balance at august  was primarily the result of the timing of year end cash collections that had not yet been used by the company to pay down its revolving line of credit prior to fiscal year end 
consequently  the increased cash at august  was offset by a corresponding increase in the balance of the company s line of credit as of august  cash flow provided by operations was  in fiscal compared to  and  during fiscal and  respectively 
cash provided by operations during fiscal was primarily due to operating income offset by increased inventory and accounts receivable balances which were higher as a direct result of an increased customer backlog and increased sales volume in fiscal additionally  the company received the benefit of lower income taxes payable due to the exercise of stock options 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was as of august  compared to as of august  and as of august  the increase of the company s current ratio at year end was primarily attributable to increases in accounts receivable  inventories and prepaid expenses combined with a decrease in the current portion of long term debt

as of october   the company had million in available credit under this credit facility 
under the terms of the company s credit facility  the company must comply with certain debt covenants related to a the ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth and b the ratio of operating cash flow to debt service on a rolling twelve month basis 
the company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of august  in addition to this primary credit facility  the company borrowed  from citizens bank of massachusetts in october in order to fund its acquisition of concoat holdings limited 
this borrowing involved an unsecured  five year term note with interest payments due monthly and principal payments due quarterly 
interest is calculated at the applicable libor rate plus a margin of per annum 
interest payments are due on the first day of each month 
in addition to monthly interest payments  chase corporation must make quarterly payments of principal in the amount of  on each quarterly anniversary of the first interest payment date during the term of the note 
the loan is subject to certain covenants which require chase corporation to maintain certain financial ratios  including total liabilities to tangible net worth and debt service coverage rations

key topics covered by sab include a valuation models sab reinforces the flexibility allowed by sfas r to choose an option pricing model that meets the standard s fair value measurement objective  b expected volatility the sab provides guidance on when it would be appropriate to rely exclusively on either historical or implied volatility in estimating expected volatility  and c expected term the new guidance includes examples and some simplified approaches to determining the expected term under certain circumstances 
the company will apply the principles of sab in conjunction with its adoption of sfas r 
critical accounting policies  judgments  and estimates the us securities and exchange commission sec requires companies to provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies 
the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and operating results  and require management to make its most significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company s critical accounting policies are described below 
accounts receivable the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
in cases where the company is aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to it  a specific allowance against amounts due to the company is recorded  and thereby reduces the net recognized receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
for all other customers  the company recognizes allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  industry and geographic concentrations  the current business environment and its historical experience 
if the financial condition of the company s customers deteriorates or if economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be required in the future  which could have an adverse impact on the future operating results of the company 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
management assesses the recoverability of inventory based on types and levels of inventory held  forecasted demand and changes in technology 
these assessments require management judgments and estimates  and valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory may be recorded based on these assessments 
the company estimates excess and obsolescence exposures based upon assumptions about future demand  product transitions  and market conditions and records reserves to reduce inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
the failure to accurately forecast demand may lead to additional excess an obsolete inventory and future charges 
goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets long lived assets consist of goodwill  identifiable intangible assets  trademarks  patents and agreements and property  plant  and equipment 
intangible assets and property  plant  and equipment  excluding goodwill  are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful life 
the company reviews long lived assets and all intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill is also reviewed at least annually for impairment 
factors which the company considers important and that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the company determines whether an impairment has occurred based on gross expected future cash flows  and measures the amount of the impairment based on the related future discounted cash flows 
the cash flow estimates used to determine impairment  if any  contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
see notes to consolidated financial statements 
the estimates of expected cash flows require the company to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of the company s control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue at the time of shipment which is typically when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  performance of its obligation is complete  its price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and the company is reasonably assured of collecting 
if a loss is anticipated on any contract  a provision for the entire loss is made immediately 
revenue recognition involves judgments and assessments of expected returns  and the likelihood of nonpayment due to insolvent customers 
the company analyzes various factors  including a review of specific transactions  historical experience  creditworthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions in determining when to recognize revenue 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income 
commissions are recognized when earned and confirmed on commission statements received from the manufacturers represented 
royalty revenue is recognized based on licensee production statements received from the authorized manufacturers 
billed shipping and handling fees are recorded as sales revenue with the associated costs recorded as costs of products and services sold 
deferred income taxes the company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
pension benefits the company sponsors a non contributory defined benefit pension plan pension plan covering substantially all employees of certain businesses of the company 
in calculating its retirement plan obligations and related expense  the company makes various assumptions and estimates 
these assumptions include discount rates  benefits earned  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the company s pension obligations and future expense 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings 
in the event of significant inflation  the company s efforts to recover cost increases would be hampered as a result of the competitive nature of the industries in which it operates 
forward looking information from time to time  the company may publish  verbally or in written form  forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  business prospects  technological developments  new products  research and development activities and similar matters 
in fact  this form k or any other periodic reporting documents required by the act may contain forward looking statements reflecting the current views of the company concerning potential future events or developments 
the private securities litigation reform act of the act provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  the company cautions investors that any forward looking statements made by the company are not guarantees of future performance and that a variety of factors could cause the company s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements

risk factors the company currently operates in a mature market where increases or decreases in market share could be significant 
the company s sales and net income are dependent on recurring sales from a consistent and established customer base 
organic growth opportunities are minimal  however  the company has and will continue to use strategic acquisitions as a means to build and grow the business 
the company s business strategy includes the pursuit of strategic acquisitions 
from time to time  the company engages in discussions with potential target companies concerning potential acquisitions 
in executing its acquisition strategy  the company may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates 
in addition  the company may face competition from other companies for acquisition candidates  making it more difficult to acquire suitable companies on favorable terms 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company faces limited exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results

if the company places its funds in other than demand deposit accounts  it uses instruments that meet high credit quality standards such as money market funds  government securities  and commercial paper 
during fiscal  the company had very limited currency exposure since all invoices were denominated in us dollars 
historically  the company has maintained minimal cash balances outside of the united states and  other than the currency conversion effects on the fixed assets in canada which were deferred and recorded directly in equity due to the canadian dollar being designated as the functional currency  and reported in the statement of changes in equity  there were no significant assets held in foreign currencies
