critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  accounts receivable  inventories  recoverability of long lived assets  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  pensions and other employee benefit plan obligations  and contingencies 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition products are shipped utilizing common carriers direct to customers or  for consignment products  to customer specified warehouse locations 
sales are recognized when the company s products are shipped direct or transferred from a warehouse location to the customer  at which time transfer of ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer 
the company reduces sales revenues for discounts based on past experience 
differences may result in the amount of discounts if actual experience differs significantly from management estimates  such differences have not historically been material 
accounts receivable accounts receivable is comprised of balances due from customers net of estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts 
in determining allowances  historical trends are evaluated and economic conditions and specific customer issues are reviewed to arrive at appropriate allowances 
allowance levels change as customer specific circumstances and the other analysis areas noted above change 
differences may result in the amount for allowances if actual experience differs significantly from management estimates  such differences have not historically been material 
inventory valuation the company uses certain estimates and judgments to value inventory 
inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market 
the company reviews its inventories for excess or obsolete products or components 
based on an analysis of historical usage and management s evaluation of estimated future demand  market conditions and alternative uses for possible excess or obsolete parts  reserves are recorded or changed 
significant fluctuations in demand or changes in market conditions could impact management s estimates of necessary reserves 
excess and obsolete inventory is periodically disposed through sale to third parties  scrapping or other means  and the reserves are appropriately reduced 
differences may result in the amount for reserves if actual experience differs significantly from management estimates  such differences have not historically been material 
goodwill and other intangible assets under the requirements of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is no longer amortized  however it is tested for impairment annually or more frequently whenever events or change in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired 
the company performs impairment reviews for its reporting unit using future cash flows based on management s judgments and assumptions 
an asset s value is impaired if our estimate of the aggregate future cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  to be generated are less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill 
such cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income and historical trends  as well as the effects of demand and competition 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill over the fair value 
such estimates require the use of judgment and numerous subjective assumptions  which  if actual experience varies  could result in material differences in the requirements for impairment charges 
income taxes under the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  which  if actual experience varies  could result in material adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities 
warranty obligations warranty terms are generally two years from date of manufacture or one year from date of installation 
warranty liability is recorded when revenue is recognized and is based on actual historical return rates from the most recent warranty periods 
while the company s warranty costs have historically been within its calculated estimates  it is possible that future warranty costs could exceed those estimates 
pension and employee benefit obligations with the assistance of actuaries and investment advisors the company selects the discount rate to be used to determine pension and post retirement plan liabilities based on a review of moody s aa bond ratings and u 
s treasury rates 
a change in the discount rate selected by the company of basis points would result in a change of about million of employee benefit expense 
the company consults with actuaries  asset allocation consultants and investment advisors to determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets based on historical and projected rates of return on the types of assets in which the plans have invested 
a change in the long term rate of return selected by the company of basis points would result in a change of about million of employee benefit expense
