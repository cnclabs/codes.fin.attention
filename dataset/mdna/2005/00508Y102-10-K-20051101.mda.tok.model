index to financial statements critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses the financial condition and results of operations as reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to inventory valuation  depreciation  amortization and the recoverability of long lived assets  including intangible assets  medical  product warranty  and other reserves  litigation  and environmental matters 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its substantial historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management discusses the development of accounting estimates with the company s audit committee 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the accounting policies of acuity brands 
the management of acuity brands believes the following represent the company s critical accounting estimates inventories acuity brands records inventory at the lower of cost on a first in  first out or average cost basis or market 
management reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on estimated future demand and current market conditions 
a significant change in customer demand or market conditions could render certain inventory obsolete and thus could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results in the period the change occurs 
long lived and intangible assets and goodwill acuity brands reviews goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of the long lived asset below its carrying value 
all other long lived and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value  which would be determined based on either discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods 
the evaluation of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives for impairment requires management to use significant judgments and estimates including  but not limited to  projected future net sales  operating results  and cash flow of each of the company s businesses 
although management currently believes that the estimates used in the evaluation of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are reasonable  differences between actual and expected net sales  operating results  and cash flow could cause these assets to be deemed impaired 
if this were to occur  the company would be required to charge to earnings the write down in value of such assets  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position  but not its cash flow from operations 
specifically  acuity brands has two unamortized trade names with an aggregate carrying value of million 
management estimates the fair value of these unamortized trade names using a fair value model based on discounted future cash flows 
future cash flows associated with each of the company s unamortized trade names are calculated by applying a theoretical royalty rate a willing third party would pay for use of the particular trade name to estimated future net sales 
the present value of the resulting after tax cash flow is management s current 
table of contents 
index to financial statements estimate of the fair value of the trade names 
this fair value model requires management to make several significant assumptions  including estimated future net sales  the royalty rate  and the discount rate 
differences between expected and actual results can result in significantly different valuations 
if future operating results are unfavorable compared to forecasted amounts  the company may be required to reduce the theoretical royalty rate used in the fair value model 
a reduction in the theoretical royalty rate would result in lower expected  future after tax cash flow in the valuation model 
accordingly  an impairment charge would be recorded at that time 
to illustrate the potential impact of unfavorable changes in the assumptions underlying the fair value model  a one hundred basis point reduction in the theoretical royalty rate related to the valuation of the holophane trade name acquired in would result in a pre tax impairment charge of approximately million  or of the carrying value of the trade name 
self insurance it is the policy of the company to self insure for certain insurable property and casualty risks consisting primarily of physical loss to property  business interruptions resulting from property losses  workers compensation  comprehensive general liability  and auto liability 
insurance coverage is obtained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract 
based on an independent actuary s estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred  a provision for claims under the self insured program is recorded and revised annually 
the actuarial estimates are subject to uncertainty from various sources  including  among others  changes in claim reporting patterns  claim settlement patterns  judicial decisions  legislation  and economic conditions 
although acuity brands believes that the actuarial estimates are reasonable  significant differences related to the items noted above could materially affect the company s self insurance obligations and future expense 
the company is also self insured for the majority of its medical benefit plans 
the company estimates its aggregate liability for claims incurred by applying a lag factor to the company s historical claims and administrative cost experience 
the appropriateness of the company s lag factor is evaluated and revised  if necessary  annually 
although management believes that the current estimates are reasonable  significant differences related to claim reporting patterns  legislation  and general economic conditions could materially affect the company s medical benefit plan liabilities and future expense 
product warranty acuity brands records an allowance for the estimated amount of future warranty costs when the related revenue is recognized  primarily based on historical experience of identified warranty claims 
excluding costs related to recalls due to faulty components provided by third parties  historical warranty costs have been within expectations 
however  there can be no assurance that future warranty costs will not exceed historical amounts 
if actual future warranty costs exceed historical amounts  additional allowances may be required  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results in future periods 
litigation acuity brands recognizes expense for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
due to the difficulty in estimating costs of resolving legal claims  actual costs may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved 
environmental matters the company recognizes expense for known environmental claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
the actual cost of resolving environmental issues may be higher or lower than that reserved primarily due to difficulty in estimating such costs and potential changes in the status of government regulations
