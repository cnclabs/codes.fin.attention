item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our audited financial statements and the related notes thereto 
overview we invest primarily in single tenant properties under long term leases to the us government  state governments  local governments  and government sponsored enterprises 
we are a self managed  self administered company that has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust  or reit  under the federal tax laws 
we believe that we are the only public company focused solely on investing in government leased properties 
we own each of our properties through separate wholly owned entities 
our business consists of buying and managing recently built or renovated office properties primarily leased to the federal government  acting through the general services administration gsa  the federal government s property management arm  under long term leases 
our portfolio consisted of twelve properties totaling  rentable square feet as of december  these properties are occupied and have a 
table of contents weighted average remaining lease term of approximately years based on the square footage of the properties as of december  our tenants include drug enforcement administration social security administration department of justice federal bureau of investigation bureau of public debt food drug administration veterans administration outpatient clinic hollings judicial center federal courthouse citizenship immigration services we own each of our properties through separate wholly owned entities 
we intend to expand our portfolio by acquiring additional government leased properties 
based on the credit worthiness of our governmental tenants  our policy is to use debt to finance  on average  approximately of the acquisition cost of the properties that we buy 
we intend to finance our future acquisitions with a combination of cash  common stock  long term fixed rate debt and short term credit lines 
we intend to use our credit lines to finance acquisitions and deposits on a short term basis 
our objective is to finance each property with long term fixed rate debt whose maturity matches or exceeds  to the extent possible  the remaining term of the lease 
this strategy minimizes interest rate risk and should result in more consistent and reliable cash flow 
leases for governmental tenants vary widely and include net leases  gross leases and modified gross leases 
net leases require the tenant to pay all operating expenses  gross leases require the landlord to pay all operating expenses  and modified gross leases require the landlord and the tenant each to pay a portion of the operating expenses 
we intend to acquire properties with all three types of leases  as well as variations of these leases  because we believe that gross leases and modified gross leases may provide higher returns for us than net leases 
in our experience  gsa leases are generally modified gross leases 
we plan to mitigate the higher risk of gross leases and modified gross leases through strict underwriting  due diligence and intensive property management 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize rental revenue on the straight line method over the terms of the related lease agreements for new leases and the remaining terms of existing leases for acquired properties 
differences between rental revenue earned and amounts due per the respective lease agreements are credited or charged  as applicable  to deferred rent receivable 
rental payments received prior to their recognition as income are classified as rent received in advance 
our leases are generally only subject to annual inflation increases over the term of the lease for a portion of the rent due 
our leases generally contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse us for real estate taxes incurred by us over a specified base amount 
such amounts are recognized as tenant reimbursement revenue in the period in which the real estate tax expenses over the specified base amount are incurred 
we make estimates related to the collectibility of our accounts receivable related to rent  expense reimbursements and other revenue 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  tenant concentrations  tenant credit worthiness  geographic concentrations and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
these estimates have a direct impact on our net income because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net income 

table of contents real estate we record real estate at depreciated cost 
expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred 
significant renovations and improvements that improve or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life 
all development projects and related carrying costs are capitalized and reported on the consolidated balance sheet as real estate under development 
as each project is completed and becomes available for lease up  the total cost of the building is depreciated over the estimated useful life 
interest and personnel support cost directly related to the development are capitalized as part of the real estate under development to the extent that such charges do not cause the carrying value of the asset to exceed its net realizable value 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of years for buildings and improvements  five to seven years for equipment and fixtures and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements  tenant origination costs and intangible lease costs 
we must estimate the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate we would depreciate these investments over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis 
when circumstances such as adverse market conditions indicate a possible impairment of the value of a property  we review the recoverability of the property s carrying value 
our review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the real estate investment s use and eventual disposition 
our cash flow estimate considers factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if an impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
these estimates have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
purchase price allocation we allocate the purchase price of properties we acquire to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we utilize a number of sources  including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data 
we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we allocate a portion of the purchase price to above market and below market in place lease values for acquired properties based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii our estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
in the case of below market leases  we consider the remaining contractual lease period and renewal periods  taking into consideration the likelihood of the tenant exercising its renewal options 
the capitalized above market lease values which would be presented as lease intangibles in consolidated balance sheet would be amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases  which currently range from seven to years 
the capitalized below market lease values which would be presented as deferred income would be amortized as an addition to rental income over the remaining contractual lease period and any renewal periods included in the valuation analysis 
we currently have no above market or below market leases 
we also assume that our at market rate tenants would not exercises any early terminations clauses in determining the value allocated to their lease or 
table of contents the amortization of the related lease costs 
if a tenant terminates its lease  the unamortized portion of the lease intangibles would be charged to expense 
we allocate a portion of the purchase to the value of leases acquired based on the difference between i the property valued with existing in place leases adjusted to market rental rates and ii the property valued as if vacant 
we utilize independent appraisals or our estimates to determine the respective in place lease values 
our estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers 
factors we consider in our analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods 
we also estimate costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
we also consider an allocation of purchase price to in place leases that have a related customer relationship intangible value 
characteristics we consider in allocating these values include the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals  among other factors 
we currently have the us government as our major tenant  but have not yet developed a relationship that we would consider to have any current intangible value 
the value of in place leases presented as tenant origination costs in consolidated balance sheet is amortized to expense over the remaining initial term of the respective leases 
the value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the remaining initial term  including any renewal periods included in the valuation analysis for the respective leases considered in our valuation analysis  but in no event does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building 
should a tenant terminate its lease  the unamortized portion of the tenant origination costs and customer relationship intangibles would be charged to expense 
amounts allocated to tangible land  building  tenant improvements  equipment and fixtures are based on independent appraisals or our own analysis of comparable properties in the existing portfolio

in april  we entered into a million revolving credit facility led by first national bank of omaha 
outstanding amounts under this facility accrue interest at the floating prime rate  as published by the wall street journal  which will not be lower than

we incurred the debt in june and it accrued interest at prime at december  
our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for property acquisitions  scheduled debt maturities  renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically to our properties  the costs associated with acquisitions of properties that we pursue and dividend payments to stockholders 
historically  we have satisfied our long term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital  including our existing working capital  cash provided by operations  sales of 
table of contents equity securities  and long term mortgage indebtedness 
we intend to establish sinking fund reserves  based on independent third party reports  for future capital expenditures 
since we became self managed in january  we have increased cash expenditures for general and administrative expenses  including salaries  directors and officers insurance  rent  professional fees  public company expense  and other corporate level activity 
we estimate that our annualized general and administrative cash expenses for the year ending december  to be in the range of million to million 
the increase in general and administrative cash expenses as compared to the amount incurred in is in part due to the expected increase in professional fees to be incurred to be in compliance with sarbanes oxley section the remaining expected increase in as compared to is due a full year s effect of being fully staffed in as compared to only a portion of general and administrative cash expenses exclude compensation expense from the issuance of stock grants which amounted to  in we believe that our existing cash will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  less than after year years years years total mortgage notes payable fixed rate we intend to refinance our mortgage notes payable as they become due or repay them if the related property is being sold 
total interest paid on the mortgage notes payable were  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
see note in the financial statements for more information about the mortgages 
cash distribution policy we have elected to be treated as a reit under the federal tax laws commencing as of our taxable year beginning january  to qualify as a reit  we must  among other things  distribute at least of our ordinary taxable income to our stockholders 
we intend to comply with these requirements and maintain our reit status 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on taxable income we distribute in accordance with the federal tax laws and applicable regulations to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent tax years 
even as a reit  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income  ie  taxable income not distributed in the amounts and in the time frames prescribed by the federal tax laws and applicable regulations thereunder 
we intend to pay to our stockholders  within the time periods prescribed by the federal tax laws in our case by january of the following year  all or substantially all of our annual taxable income  including gains from the sale of real estate and recognized gains on sale of securities 
we will continue our policy of making sufficient cash distributions to stockholders for us maintain reit status under the federal tax laws and to avoid corporate income and excise tax on undistributed income 
inflation our gsa leases generally contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
these provisions increase rental rates during the terms of the leases by indexed escalations based on the consumer price index 
in addition  our gsa leases generally require the tenant to pay a share of increases in operating expenses and all increases in real estate taxes 
this may reduce our exposure to increases in costs and 
table of contents operating expenses resulting from inflation 
however  increases in property operating costs above the escalation amount would harm our cash flow and may harm our ability to pay dividends 
funds from operations reit analysts generally consider funds from operations or ffo an alternative measure of performance for an equity reit 
the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  defines funds from operations as net income  computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as one of several measures of the performance of an equity reit 
we further believe that by excluding the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs  which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo can facilitate comparison of operating performance between periods and between other equity reits 
investors should review ffo along with gaap net income available for common shares and cash flow from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  when evaluating an equity reit s operating performance 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than us 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  determined in accordance with gaap  as an indication of our financial performance  or to cash flow from operating activities  determined in accordance with gaap  as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
the following table presents a reconciliation of gaap to our funds from operations for the periods presented year ended december  net loss adjustments to reconcile to funds from operations gain from disposal of property real estate depreciation and amortization a funds from operations funds from operations per common share weighted average common shares outstanding a excludes depreciation of non real estate assets of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
risk factors risks related to our business and properties our management joined us in and did not have prior experience operating a reit or a public company 
our president and chief executive officer joined us in september  our chief financial officer joined us in september  our director of asset acquisition joined us in december  our director of asset management joined us in december  and the remainder of our management joined us in our management did not have any prior experience operating a reit or a publicly owned company 
given our 
table of contents management s limited experience with our company  you should be cautious in drawing conclusions about our ability to execute our business plan and to operate as a public company 
the pace of our property acquisitions to date has resulted in cash flow that is insufficient to cover dividends at their current level 
we acquired one property for an amount of million in the first quarter of  two properties for an aggregate amount of million in the second quarter of  two properties for an aggregate amount of in the third quarter of  and three properties for an aggregate amount of million in the fourth quarter of net income from the properties we own has been significantly less than the dividends we have paid to date 
to continue to pay dividends at their current level the company will be required to use some of the equity capital we raised in its january offering for at least the remainder of the closings of our property acquisitions are subject to conditions that may prevent us from acquiring such properties 
our ability to complete acquisitions depends upon many factors  such as the negotiation of definitive purchase agreements  the satisfactory results from the due diligence work  completion of construction  and satisfaction of customary closing conditions 
we have abandoned several prospective purchases due to the failure of one or more of these circumstances 
the inability to complete future acquisitions within our anticipated time frames may harm our financial results and undercut our ability to pay dividends at their current level 
our use of debt financing could decrease our cash flow and expose us to risk of default under our debt documents 
our policy is to use debt to finance  on average  approximately of the acquisition cost of the properties that we buy 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding indebtedness representing of the acquisition cost of properties  we owned as of that date 
since we anticipate that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to repay all of our indebtedness prior to maturity  we expect that we will have to repay debt through refinancing  sale of properties or sale of additional equity 
if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms  or at all  we might be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties on unfavorable terms  which might result in losses to us and which might adversely affect our cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of a refinancing result in higher interest rates on such refinancing  our interest expense would increase  which could seriously harm our operating results and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends 
our debt and any increase in our debt may be detrimental to our business and financial results by requiring us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest  which reduces the amount available for the operation of our properties or the payment of dividends  imposing restrictive covenants in our loan documents  which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations and foreclose on our properties  if materially violated  placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have less debt  making us more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns and reducing our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  requiring us to sell one or more properties  possibly on unfavorable terms  and limiting our ability in the future to borrow funds for operations and to finance property acquisitions and to refinance our indebtedness at maturity on acceptable terms 

table of contents our ability to obtain debt financing could be impaired or delayed due to underwriting restrictions applicable to the type of properties we acquire 
our policy is to obtain debt financing related to properties we buy 
because of the single tenant nature of the properties we acquire  mortgage underwriters take certain additional precautions intended to assure that the remaining mortgage balance is paid at the end of the loan term 
also  for mortgages which have an amortization schedule longer than the lease term  due to the high initial per square foot cost of the property being acquired  mortgage lenders consider the high per square foot remaining principal balance at the end of the mortgage term as a negative with regard to the potential approval of the loan 
these and other similar negative factors associated with our properties may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to finance or refinance our properties compared to other types of commercial real estate 
because our principal tenant is the us government  our properties may have a higher risk of terrorist attack than similar properties leased to non governmental tenants 
because our principal tenant is the us government  our properties may have a higher risk of terrorist attack than similar properties that are leased to non governmental tenants 
some of our properties could be considered high profile targets because of the particular government tenant eg  the fbi 
certain losses resulting from terrorist attacks may be uninsurable 
additional terrorism insurance may not be available at a reasonable price or at all 
we depend on the us government for most of our revenues 
any failure by the us government to perform its obligations or renew its leases upon expiration may harm our cash flow and ability to pay dividends 
rent from the us government represented of our revenues from continuing operations for the year ended december  in addition  the us government leased of our total leased square feet of property not held for sale as of december  any default by the us government  or its failure to renew its leases with us upon their expiration  could cause interruptions in the receipt of lease revenue or result in vacancies  or both  which would reduce our revenue until the affected property is leased  and could decrease the ultimate value of the affected property upon sale 
further  failure on the part of a tenant to comply with the terms of a lease may cause us to find another tenant 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to find another tenant without incurring substantial costs  or at all  or that  if another tenant were found  we would be able to enter into a new lease on favorable terms 
an increase in the operating costs of our government leased properties would harm our cash flow and ability to pay dividends 
leased properties in which the tenant is wholly responsible for any increases in operating costs that apply to the property are not typical of the leases entered into through the gsa  the principal leasing agency of the federal government 
under present practice  most gsa leases only cover increases in real estate taxes above a base amount and these gsa leases also increase that portion of the rent applicable to other operating expenses by an agreed upon percentage based upon the consumer price index 
typically  operating expenses in these leases does not include insurance cost 
to the extent operating costs other than real estate taxes and insurance increase at a rate greater than the specified percentage  our cash flow would be harmed and our ability to pay dividends may be harmed 
if we are unable to lease properties that are partially or completely vacant  we may be required to recognize an impairment loss with respect to the carrying values of these properties  which may seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 
any of our properties could become partially or completely vacant in the future 
if we are unable to re lease these properties and generate sufficient cash flow to replace or exceed that amount lost due to the vacancy  we will be required to recognize financial loss as to that property  which could harm our operating results and our ability to pay dividends 

table of contents restrictive covenants in our loan documents may restrict our operating or acquisition activities  which may harm our financial condition and operating results 
the mortgages on our properties contain customary restrictive covenants  including provisions that may limit the borrowing subsidiary s ability  without the prior consent of the lender  to incur additional indebtedness  further mortgage or transfer the applicable property  purchase or acquire additional property  discontinue insurance coverage  change the conduct of its business or make loans or advances to  enter into any transaction of merger or consolidation with  or acquire the business  assets or equity of  any third party 
in addition  our future lines of credit or loans may contain financial covenants  further restrictive covenants and other obligations 
if we materially breach such covenants or obligations in our debt agreements  the lender can legally declare a default and may require us to repay the debt immediately and  can foreclose on property securing the loan 
we may then have to sell properties either at a loss or at a time that prevents us from achieving a higher price 
any failure to pay our indebtedness when due or failure to cure events of default could result in higher interest rates during the period of the loan default and could ultimately result in the loss of properties through foreclosure 
increasing competition for the acquisition of government leased properties may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitions 
we compete with many other entities for the acquisition of government leased properties 
our competitors include financial institutions  institutional pension funds  other reits  other public and private real estate companies and private real estate investors 
these competitors may prevent us from acquiring desirable properties or increase the price we must pay for properties 
our competitors may have greater resources than we do and may be willing to pay more for similar property 
in addition  the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for government leased properties may increase in the future  resulting in increased demand and increased prices paid for these properties 
if we are forced to pay higher prices for properties  our profitability may decrease  and our stockholders may experience a lower return on their investment 
we may have limited time to perform due diligence on many potential property acquisitions  which could result in the loss of acquisition opportunities 
when we enter into an agreement to acquire a property we often have limited time to complete our due diligence prior to acquiring the property 
pursuant to company policy if we cannot complete our full due diligence review process within the time allotted  we will decline to proceed with an attempt to acquire the property 
accordingly  we may lose property acquisitions due to lack of sufficient time to complete our due diligence 
our cash flow is not assured 
we may not pay dividends in the future 
our ability to pay dividends may be adversely affected by the risks described herein 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to pay dividends in the future 
we also cannot assure you that the level of our dividends will increase over time or the receipt of income from additional property acquisitions will necessarily increase our cash available for distribution to stockholders 
the failure to make expected cash dividend distributions will likely result in a decrease in the market price of our stock 
our board of directors may alter our investment policies at any time without stockholder approval 
our board of directors may alter our investment policies at any time without stockholder approval 
changes to these policies may adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to maintain or pay dividends 

table of contents we have incurred historical losses and may incur future losses 
we have had historical accounting losses of million for the year ended december   and had an accumulated deficit of million  of which million was for dividends  as of december  we cannot assure you that we will not have similar losses in the future 
risks related to our organization and structure we depend on key personnel with long standing business relationships  the loss of whom could threaten our ability to operate our business successfully 
our future success depends  to a significant extent  upon the continued services of thomas d 
peschio  our president and chief executive officer  and of the other members of our management team 
in particular  the relationships that mr 
peschio and the other members of our management team have developed with owners and developers of government leased properties are critically important to the success of our business 
although we have an employment agreement with mr 
peschio  we cannot assure you that he and the other key acquisition personnel will remain employed with us 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers 
a majority of the voting power over our shares is currently concentrated in a relatively small number of unrelated investment managers our shareholder records show that less than investment managers  who have been granted the right by their respective clients to vote our shares  control a majority of our stock 
accordingly  this relatively small number of unrelated investment managers could  if acting in concert based on a common interest or concern  vote a majority of the company s shares to achieve a common objective 
this result could be deemed harmful to the company and its other shareholders 
our board of directors may authorize the issuance of additional shares that may cause dilution 
in connection with future equity offerings  as well as stock grants pursuant to the company s equity incentive plan  the board of directors may authorize the issuance of additional shares of common stock 
the issuance of additional shares could cause either immediately or at a later date a dilution with per share value to our existing stockholders 
our board of directors may authorize the issuance of shares with differing dividend rights that could harm our stockholders right to receive dividends 
our board of directors has the power to issue preferred stock or other securities that have distribution rights senior to that of the common stock 
any superior dividend rights could prevent us from paying dividends to the holders of our common stock 
our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against directors and officers are limited 
maryland law provides that a director has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith  in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances 
our governing documents obligate us to indemnify our directors and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities to the extent permitted by maryland law which applies broadly 
additionally  we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers 
finally  our governing documents limit the liability of our directors and officers for money damages  except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money  property or services  or a final judgment based upon a finding of active and deliberate dishonesty by the director  trustee or officer that was material to the cause of action adjudicated 

table of contents as a result  we and our stockholders have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist without these conditions 
our ownership limitations may restrict business combination opportunities 
to preserve our reit status  our charter generally prohibits direct or indirect ownership through affiliates by any person of more than of the number or value of outstanding shares of any class of our securities  including our common stock 
any transfer of our common stock that would disqualify our reit status will be null and void  and the intended transferee will acquire no rights in such stock 
these ownership limitations could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control or other transaction in which holders of common stock might receive a premium for their common stock over the then current market price or which such holders might believe to be otherwise in their best interest 
further  shares that are transferred in excess of the ownership limit will be designated as excess shares subject to redemption 
the ownership limitation provisions also may make our common stock an unsuitable investment vehicle for any person seeking to obtain  either alone or with others as a group  ownership of more than of the number or value of outstanding shares of any class of our securities 
maryland law grants broad authority to our board to reject any outside proposal involving a change in control 
maryland law provides broad discretion to our board of directors with respect to its duties in considering a change in control of our company  including that a board is subject to no greater level of scrutiny in considering a change in control transaction than with respect to any other action within its authority that it considers 
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have employment agreements that provide them with benefits in the event their employment is terminated  which could prevent or deter a potential acquirer from pursuing a change of control of our company 
we have entered into employment agreements with thomas d 
peschio  our president and chief executive officer  and nancy d 
olson  our treasurer and chief financial officer  which provide them with severance benefits if their employment ends due to a termination by us without cause 
in the case of such termination  we would have to pay severance and the vesting of their restricted stock will accelerate 
mr 
peschio also has the right to terminate his employment agreement upon a change of control of our company and receive severance benefits 
these agreements could prevent or deter a change of control of our company that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 
mr 
peschio s employment agreement is further discussed in our registration statement on form s and is included as exhibit in the registration statement 
risks related to the real estate industry mortgage debt obligations expose us to increased risk of property losses  which could harm our financial condition  cash flow and ability to satisfy our other debt obligations and pay dividends 
incurring mortgage debt increases our risk of property losses because defaults on indebtedness secured by properties may result in our loss of the property securing any loan for which we are in default 
for tax purposes  a foreclosure is treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage 
the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage could exceed our tax basis in the property  which would cause us to recognize taxable income on foreclosure  without receiving corresponding cash proceeds 
as a result  we may be required to utilize other sources of cash to pay our taxes  which may result in a decrease in cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
in addition  our default under any one of our mortgage debt obligations may increase the risk of our default on our other indebtedness 
if this occurs  our financial condition  cash flow and ability to satisfy our other debt obligations or ability to pay dividends may be harmed 

table of contents illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties and harm our financial condition 
because real estate investments are relatively illiquid  our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to changing economic  financial and investment conditions is limited 
the real estate market is affected by many factors that are beyond our control  including adverse changes in national and local economic and market conditions  changes in interest rates and in the availability  cost and terms of debt financing  changes in governmental laws and regulations  fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and costs of compliance with laws and regulations  fiscal policies and ordinances  the ongoing need for capital improvements  particularly in older structures  changes in operating expenses  and civil unrest  acts of war and natural disasters  including earthquakes and floods  which may result in uninsured and underinsured losses 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us  or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us 
we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property 
these factors and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties could harm our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to pay dividends to stockholders 
compliance with environmental laws could materially increase our operating expenses 
there may be environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware 
if environmental contamination exists on our properties  we could become subject to strict liability for the contamination 
the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell the property and we may incur substantial remediation costs 
in addition  although we may require in our leases that tenants operate in compliance with all applicable laws and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from a tenant s activities on the property  we could nonetheless be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest  and we cannot be sure that our tenants would satisfy their indemnification obligations such environmental liability exposure associated with our properties could harm our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends to stockholders 
our properties may contain or develop harmful mold  which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediating the problem 
the presence of significant mold at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property 
in addition  the presence of significant mold could expose us to liability from our tenants  employees of our tenants and others if property damage for health concerns arise 
compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire  safety and other regulations may require us to make unexpected expenditures that adversely impact our ability to pay dividends 
our properties may be required to comply with the americans with disabilities act  or the ada 
compliance with the ada requirements could necessitate removal of access barriers and non compliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants  or both 
we could be required to expend our funds to comply with the provisions of the ada  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to make distributions to stockholders 
in addition  we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations  building codes and other land use regulations  as they may be adopted and become applicable to our properties 
we 
table of contents may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and which could harm our ability to pay dividends 
an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties 
our comprehensive loss insurance policies may involve substantial deductibles and certain exclusions and may not be fully in place to cover all conditions when a property is acquired 
in certain areas  we may have to obtain earthquake insurance on specific properties as required by our lenders or by law 
we have also obtained terrorism insurance on all of our gsa leased properties  but this insurance is subject to exclusions for loss or damage caused by nuclear substances  pollutants  contaminants and biological and chemical weapons 
should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above  or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy  we could lose all or part of our capital invested in  and anticipated revenue from  one or more of the properties  which could harm our operations results and financial condition as well as our ability to pay dividends 
tax risks of our business and structure an investment in our common stock has various tax risks that could affect the value of our stockholders investment 
special tax risks associated with owning stock in our company include those associated with the treatment of distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits to the extent that they exceed the adjusted basis of an investor s common stock  as long term capital gain or short term capital gain if the shares have been held for less than one year  the treatment of any dividend declared by us in october  november or december of any year payable to a stockholder of record on a specific date in any such month as being paid by us and received by the stockholder on december of such year  the treatment of any gain or loss realized upon a taxable disposition of shares by a stockholder who is not a dealer in securities as a long term capital gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year  otherwise as short term capital gain or loss  the treatment of distributions that we designate as capital gain dividends taxable to stockholders as gains to the extent that they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year from the sale or disposition of a capital asset held for greater than one year  and distributions we make and gains arising from the sale or exchange by a stockholder of shares of our stock not qualifying to be offset by passive losses 
distribution requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility in executing our business plan 
as a reit  we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least of our taxable reit income each year to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
taxable reit income is determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and by excluding net capital gains 
we are also required to pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than of our taxable income including net capital gains each year 
in addition  we are required to pay nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which certain distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of of our ordinary income for that calendar year  of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and any amount of our income that was not distributed in prior years 
we may incur additional indebtedness to meet our distribution requirements 
while we have not borrowed for the specific purpose of paying distributions  our prior borrowings allowed us to pay distributions from our cash flow from operations 
it is possible that the differences between the time we actually receive revenue or pay expenses and the period we report those items for distribution purposes  and potentially insufficient cash  could result in our having to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the distribution requirement to qualify for reit tax status 
while we have not borrowed for the specific purpose of paying distributions  our prior borrowings allowed us to pay distributions from our operations 
these borrowings may decrease cash available for distribution 

table of contents our disposal of properties may have negative implications  including unfavorable tax consequences 
if we make a sale of a property directly  and it is deemed to be a sale of dealer property or inventory  the sale may be deemed to be a prohibited transaction under the provisions of the federal tax laws applicable to reits  in which case our gain from the sale would be subject to a penalty tax 
if we believe that a sale of a property might be treated as a prohibited transaction  we will attempt to structure a sale through a taxable reit subsidiary  in which case the gain from the sale would be subject to corporate income tax but not the prohibited transaction tax 
we cannot assure you  however  that the irs would not assert successfully that sales of properties that we make directly  rather than through a taxable reit subsidiary  were sales of dealer property or inventory  in which case the penalty tax would apply 
if we fail to remain qualified as a reit  our dividends will not be deductible by us  and our income will be subject to taxation 
if we fail to remain qualified as a reit  our dividends will not be deductible by us and we will be subject to a corporate level tax on our taxable income 
this would substantially reduce our cash available to pay dividends and the yield on your investment 
incurring corporate income tax liability might cause us to borrow funds  liquidate some of our investments or take other steps which could negatively affect our operating results 
if our reit status is terminated because of our failure to meet a reit qualification requirement or if we voluntarily revoke our election  we would be disqualified from electing treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which reit status is lost 
we may be subject to federal income tax  state income  franchise and other local taxes that would harm our financial condition 
even if we maintain our status as a reit  we may become subject to federal income taxes 
for example  if we have net income from a sale of dealer property or inventory  that income will be subject to a penalty tax 
in addition  we may not be able to pay sufficient distributions to avoid corporate income tax and the excise tax on undistributed income 
we may also be subject to state and local taxes on our income or property  either directly or at the level of our operating entities through which we indirectly own our properties that would aversely affect our operating results 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain reit status  or that it will be in our best interests to continue to do so 
we may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could reduce the market price of our common stock 
the federal tax laws governing reits and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time 
any of those new laws or interpretations may take effect retroactively 
for example  on may   president bush signed into law legislation that could cause shares in non reit corporations to be a more attractive investment to individual investors than they had been  because of lower tax rates on their dividends as compared to the tax rate paid by shareholders receiving reit distributions 
this and other tax legislation in the future could harm the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments depend upon prevailing market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
market risk related to fixed rate debt as of december   our debt included fixed rate mortgage notes with a carrying value of million 
changes in market interest rates on our fixed rate debt impacts the fair market value of the debt  but it has no impact on interest incurred or cash flow 
the sensitivity analysis related to our fixed debt 
table of contents assumes an immediate basis point move in interest rates from their actual december  levels  with all other variables held constant 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million at december  a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase in the fair market value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million at december  interest rate sensitivity the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate sensitivity 
the table presents mortgage notes payable cash flows by expected maturity date and weighted average interest rate 
interest rate sensitivity thereafter total mortgage notes payable fixed rate amount weighted average interest rate
