table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those described under item  description of business cautionary factors that may affect future operating results 
overview general in  we initiated a strategy of focusing on leasing rather than selling our portable storage units 
as a result of this change  leasing revenues as a percentage of our total revenues increased steadily from in to in the number of portable storage and combination storage office and mobile office units in our lease fleet increased from  at the end of to  at the end of  representing a compounded annual growth rate  or cagr  of 
we derive most of our revenues from the leasing of portable storage containers and portable offices 
the average contracted lease term at lease inception is approximately months for portable storage units and approximately months for portable offices 
after the expiration of the contracted lease term  units continue on lease on a month to month basis 
in  the over all lease term averaged months for portable storage units and months for portable offices 
as a result of these long average lease terms  our leasing business tends to provide us with a recurring revenue stream and minimizes fluctuations in revenues 
however  there is no assurance that we will maintain such lengthy overall lease terms 
in addition to our leasing business  we also sell portable storage containers and occasionally we sell portable office units 
since  when we changed our focus to leasing  our sales revenues as a percentage of total revenues has decreased from in to in over the last seven years  mobile mini has grown both through internally generated growth and acquisitions which we use to gain a presence in new markets 
typically  we enter a new market through the acquisition of the business of a smaller local competitor and then apply our business model  which is usually much more customer service and marketing focused than the business we are buying or its competitors in the market 
if we cannot find a desirable acquisition opportunity in a market we wish to enter  we establish a new location from the ground up 
as a result  a new branch location will typically have fairly low operating margins during its early years  but as our marketing efforts help us penetrate the new market and we increase the number of units on rent at the new branch  we take advantage of operating efficiencies to improve operating margins at the branch and typically reach company average levels after several years 
when we enter a new market  we incur certain costs in developing an infrastructure 
for example  advertising and marketing costs will be incurred and certain minimum staffing levels and certain minimum levels of delivery equipment will be put in place regardless of the new market s revenue base 
once we have achieved revenues during any period that are sufficient to cover our fixed expenses  we generate high margins on incremental lease revenues 
therefore  each additional unit put on lease in excess of the break even level  contributes significantly to profitability 
conversely  additional fixed expenses that we incur require us to achieve additional revenue as compared to the prior period to cover the additional expense 
as a result of these dynamics  from through  as we were adding costs related to entering many new markets  there was downward pressure on our overall operating margins 
in  the second year in a row in which we entered only one new market  this downward pressure abated 
among the external factors we examine to determine the direction of our business is the level of non residential construction activity  especially in areas of the country where we have a significant presence 
construction activity represented approximately of our units on rent at december   and because of the degree of operating leverage we have  declines in non residential construction activity can have a significant effect on our operating margins and net income 
in and  we saw weakness in the level of leasing revenues from the non residential construction sector of our customer base 
the lower than historical growth rate in revenues combined with increases in fixed costs depressed our growth in adjusted ebitda as defined below in those years 
in  the level of non residential construction activity in the us leveled off and rose slightly after two years of steep declines 
as a result of the improvement in the non residential construction sector and the general improvements in the economy  our adjusted ebitda began to grow rapidly in in managing our business  we focus on our internal growth rate in leasing revenue  which we define as growth in lease revenues on a year over year basis at our branch locations in operation for at least one year  without inclusion of same market acquisitions 
this 
table of contents internal growth rate has remained positive every quarter  but in and had fallen to single digits  from over prior to  due to the slowdown in the economy  especially as the slowdown affected the non residential construction sector in certain areas where we have large branch operations  including texas and colorado 
we achieved an internal growth rate in of  reflecting an improvement in both economic and market conditions 
mobile mini s goal is to maintain a high internal growth rate so that revenue growth will exceed inflationary growth in expenses and we can continue to take advantage of the operating leverage inherent in our business model 
we are a capital intensive business  so in addition to focusing on earnings per share  we focus on adjusted ebitda to measure our results 
we calculate this number by first calculating ebitda  which is a measure of our earnings before interest expense  debt restructuring costs  provision for income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
this measure eliminates the effect of financing transactions that we enter into on an irregular basis based on capital needs and market opportunities  and this measure provides us with a means to track internally generated cash from which we can fund our interest expense and our lease fleet growth 
in comparing ebitda from year to year  we typically further adjust ebitda to ignore the effect of what we consider non recurring events not related to our core business operations to arrive at adjusted ebitda 
the only non recurring event reflected in the adjusted ebitda has been the effect in and in of our florida litigation expense 
the litigation was concluded in in addition  several of the covenants contained under our revolving credit facility are expressed by reference to this adjusted ebitda financial measure  similarly computed 
because ebitda is a non gaap financial measure  as defined by the sec  we include in this report a reconciliation of ebitda to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
this reconciliation is included in item  selected financial data 
in managing our business  we routinely compare our adjusted ebitda margins from year to year and based upon age of branch 
we define this margin as adjusted ebitda divided by our total revenues  expressed as a percentage 
we use this comparison  for example  to study internally the effect that increased costs have on our margins 
as capital is invested in our established branch locations  we achieve higher adjusted ebitda margins on that capital than we achieve on capital invested to establish a new branch  because our fixed costs are already in place in connection with the established branches 
the fixed costs are those associated with yard and delivery equipment  as well as advertising  sales  marketing and office expenses 
with a new market or branch  we must first fund and absorb the startup costs for setting up the new branch facility  hiring and developing the management and sales team and developing our marketing and advertising programs 
a new branch will have low adjusted ebitda margins in its early years until the number of units on rent increases 
because of our high operating margins on incremental lease revenue  which we realize on a branch by branch basis when the branch achieves leasing revenues sufficient to cover the branch s fixed costs  leasing revenues in excess of the break even amount produce large increases in profitability 
conversely  absent significant growth in leasing revenues  the adjusted ebitda margin at a branch will remain relatively flat on a period by period comparative basis 
accounting and operating overview our leasing revenues include all rent and ancillary revenues we receive for our portable storage  combination storage office and mobile office units 
our sales revenues include sales of these units to customers 
our other revenues consist principally of charges for the delivery of the units we sell 
our principal operating expenses are cost of sales  leasing  selling and general expenses  and depreciation and amortization  primarily depreciation of the portable storage units in our lease fleet 
cost of sales is the cost of the units that we sold during the reported period and includes both our cost to buy  transport  refurbish and modify used ocean going containers and our cost to manufacture portable storage units and other structures 
leasing  selling and general expenses include among other expenses  advertising and other marketing expenses  commissions and corporate expenses for both our leasing and sales activities 
annual repair and maintenance expenses on our leased units over the last three years have averaged approximately of lease revenues and are included in leasing  selling and general expenses 
we expense our normal repair and maintenance costs as incurred including the cost of periodically repainting units 
our principal asset is our lease fleet  which has historically maintained value close to its original cost 
prior to  our lease fleet units other than van trailers were historically depreciated on the straight line method over our units estimated useful life  in most cases years after the date that we put the unit in service  with estimated residual values of on steel units 
effective in  we began to depreciate the steel units in our lease fleet using an estimated useful life of years  after the date the unit is placed in service  with an estimated residual value of  which effectively results in depreciation on these units at the same annual rate 
the depreciation policy is supported by our historical lease fleet data which shows that we have been able to obtain comparable rental rates and sales prices irrespective of the age of our container lease fleet 
our wood mobile office units are depreciated over twenty years to of original cost 
van trailers  which constitute a small part of our fleet  are depreciated over years to a residual value 
van trailers  which are only added to the fleet as a result of acquisitions of portable storage businesses  are of much lower quality than storage containers and consequently depreciate more rapidly

table of contents our branch expansion program and other factors can affect our overall utilization rate 
from through  our annual utilization levels averaged  and ranged from a low of in to a high of in the lower utilization rate in the last few years was primarily a result of i the fact that many of our acquired branches  at the time of the acquisition transaction and for various periods thereafter  have had utilization levels lower than our historic average rates  especially after we have added our proprietary product  ii the fact that it is easier to maintain a higher utilization rate at a large branch but we increased the number of small branches in more recent years  and iii the economic slowdown in the general economy and in particular the slowdown in the construction sector 
we entered six markets in  markets in  and one market in and  typically resulting in reduced overall utilization rates as our system absorbs the added assets 
with the addition of fewer markets in and in  we are focusing on increasing our utilization rate by balancing inventory between markets and decreasing the number of out of service units 
our utilization rate increased from in to in from the end of through the end of  we grew our lease fleet from  units to  units  representing a cagr of 
our utilization is somewhat seasonal with the low realized in the first quarter and the high realized in the fourth quarter 
results of operations the following table shows the percentage of total revenues represented by the key items that make up our statements of income  certain amounts may not add due to rounding year ended december  revenues leasing sales other total revenues costs and expenses cost of sales leasing  selling and general expenses florida litigation expense depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses income from operations other income expense interest income interest expense debt restructuring expense income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  total revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in leasing of portable storage units and portable offices accounted for approximately of total revenues during leasing revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from a increase in the average rental yield per unit and a increase in the average number of units on lease 
in  our internal growth rate increased to approximately as compared to approximately in we define internal growth as the growth in lease revenues in markets opened for at least one year  excluding any growth arising as a result of additional acquisitions in those markets 
the level of our internal growth rate in was principally due to general us domestic economic weakness  particularly associated with the non residential construction sector and particularly in several of our more established markets 
internal growth at many of our newer locations was strong during during  we saw a steady improvement in our internal growth rate from the previous year s level 
the internal growth rate during the four quarters of was   and  respectively 
we completed only one small acquisition in detroit  michigan in sales of portable storage units have accounted for and in and  respectively  of our total revenues  and we generated less than of our total revenues from other miscellaneous revenues  primarily related to our sales business and principally arising from transportation charges for the delivery of units sold and the sale of ancillary products 
our revenues from the sale of portable storage units increased million  or  to million in 
table of contents from million in this increase in sales revenue was due to an increase in both the price of steel and used steel containers  which we were able to pass on to customers who purchased our units  resulting in a higher price per unit sold 
this price increase was almost completely offset by a lower volume of units sold  as the higher sales prices made it more attractive for customers to lease rather than buy containers 
cost of sales is the cost to us of units we sold during the period 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales revenues decreased to in from in the higher profit margins in primarily related to our economies of scale associated with our higher number of units produced in resulting in lower manufacturing costs  partially offset by the increase in steel prices 
leasing  selling and general expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in leasing  selling and general expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  were and in and  respectively 
these expenses as a percentage of total revenue declined due to the operating leverage in the company s business model 
as units on rent are added to existing branches  the growth in revenues far exceeds the growth in leasing  selling and general expenses related to the incremental lease revenue 
these economies of scale were offset to some extent by increases in certain expense levels 
freight trucking expense increased by million as we used more third party vendors for the transportation of our units  particularly our modular office units which are more expensive to transport  and due to the repositioning of some of our lease fleet units from city to city 
we repositioned units to meet our customers demand by more efficiently using our existing resources  which also resulted in higher overall utilization rates 
repairs on our lease fleet increased by million due to our increased maintenance efforts which were related to the increase in our overall utilization rates 
fuel expenses increased by million due to fuel price increases and the increase in the number of deliveries and pick ups due to our larger fleet size and customer base 
repairs and maintenance of equipment increased by million principally as a result of our preventative maintenance programs and general repairs associated with servicing a larger lease fleet 
real estate rent expense increased by million for the lease properties obtained in our two acquisitions in and  new properties and lease renewals at certain of our branch locations and the general inflationary index clauses in our lease agreements 
florida litigation expense in relates to litigation and related costs incurred in connection with litigation which was concluded in ebitda in was million 
in  ebitda was million  which included the effect of million of florida litigation expense 
ebitda increased in by  adjusted ebitda increased in by approximately 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the higher depreciation was directly related to a larger fleet in  which enabled us to achieve higher lease revenues  includes the depreciation expenses associated with the refurbishment of portable storage units added to the lease fleet during and the inclusion in the lease fleet of additional wood modular offices which have a higher depreciation rate than our steel units 
by increasing our overall utilization rate  we were able to grow revenues faster than we increased the size of our lease fleet 
since december   our lease fleet cost basis for depreciation increased by million 
see critical accounting policies and estimates within this item interest expense increased million  or  to million in from million in our average debt outstanding during  compared to  increased by  primarily due to increased borrowings under our credit facility to fund the growth of our lease fleet during the year 
the increase in interest expense includes the higher interest cost associated with our senior notes  which effectively increased the weighted average interest rate on our debt to for from for  excluding amortization of debt issuance costs 
taking into account the amortization of debt issuance costs  the weighted average interest rate was in and in our weighted average interest rate is higher in due to the full year effect of the higher interest rate on the senior notes  which were issued at the end of june our senior notes bear interest at per annum  which is higher than the average borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility 
on an annualized basis  the additional interest cost incurred under the senior notes versus the senior secured credit facility  which was our sole source of borrowing prior to our issuance of the senior notes  was approximately million based on floating rates and swap rates in effect at the time the transaction was concluded 
however  the issuance of the senior notes in provided the company a great deal of additional liquidity 
see liquidity and capital resources within this item debt restructuring expense in was million and includes the termination expenses approximately million related to unwinding certain interest rate swap agreements relating to debt repaid with the proceeds from our sale during june of million of senior notes and the write off of certain capitalized debt issuance costs approximately million associated with our revolving credit agreement before it was amended and restated in june 
table of contents provision for income taxes was based on an annual effective tax rate of for and for the increase in our effective tax was primarily due to certain state tax loss carryforwards that we believe will expire before we will be able to utilize them 
at december   we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately million  which expires if unused from to in addition  we had net operating loss carryforward in the various states in which we operate 
we believe  based on internal projections  that we will generate sufficient taxable income needed to realize the corresponding federal and state deferred tax assets to the extent they are recorded as deferred tax assets in our balance sheet 
net income in was million  as compared to million in in  net income included after tax charges of million related to florida litigation expense and after tax charges of million related to debt restructuring expense 
twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  total revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in leasing portable storage units and portable offices accounts for the majority of our revenues  and accounted for approximately of total revenues during leasing revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from an increase in the average number of units on lease 
in  our internal growth rate was approximately as compared to approximately in we completed only one small acquisition in portland  oregon in late the slowdown in our internal growth rate in and is principally due to general economic weakness  particularly associated with the non residential construction sector and particularly in several of our more established markets 
internal growth at many of our newer locations was strong 
this growth was offset by weakness at certain of our older more established branches  especially those in texas and colorado  which were affected by weakness in construction in the markets that those branches serve 
sales of portable storage units have accounted for approximately to in and  respectively  of our total revenues  and we generate less than of our total revenues from other miscellaneous revenues  primarily related to our sales business  principally transportation charges for the delivery of units sold and the sale of ancillary products 
our revenues from the sale of portable storage units increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase is partially due to increase sales at the locations we added in and a large government sale in the fourth quarter  partially offset by lower sales volume at our more established locations 
cost of sales is the cost to us of units that we sold during the period 
cost of sales increased million  or  to million in from million in cost of sales  as a percentage of sales revenues  increased to in from in this slight decrease in sales margins is not significant and is partially attributable to lower margins on the government sale made in the fourth quarter  and the sales of van trailers at much lower margins than our principal products 
leasing  selling and general expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in leasing  selling and general expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  was and in and  respectively 
these expenses as a percentage of total revenues declined at older branches  as we were able to benefit from economies of scale as those branches grew 
this was offset by higher leasing  selling and general expenses as a percentage of total revenues at newer branches 
in general  new branches initially have lower operating margins until their fixed operating costs are covered by higher leasing volumes that typically are not achieved until the branch has been operated for several years 
among the other major increases in leasing  selling and general expenses in were increases in insurance expense million  advertising expense million  rent expense million which related in significant part to the addition of new locations during the second half of  property tax expense million and fuel expenses incurred in connection with the delivery and pick up of leased containers million 
florida litigation expense relates to litigation and related costs incurred in connection with our florida litigation which was concluded in we recorded approximately million and million of costs and legal expenses in connection with this suit and related litigation in and  respectively

table of contents rate associated with wood mobile offices which were a larger part of our fleet in see critical accounting policies and estimates within this item interest expense increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily the result of the issuance in june of our senior notes  the proceeds of which were used to replace lower interest secured debt 
our average debt outstanding during  compared to  increased by  with most of the increase occurring during the first six months of  primarily due to increased borrowings under our credit facility to fund the growth of our lease fleet during that period

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity summary most of mobile mini s capital expenditures are comprised of discretionary purchases of inventory  lease fleet units and equipment related to the expansion of our business 
currently  we spend approximately million to million per year in maintenance capital expenditures to replace forklifts  delivery trucks  trailers and enhancements to computer information systems 
mobile mini s outside sources of liquidity include a million senior secured revolving line of credit  public equity offerings completed in and and a million senior note offering completed in approximately million and million was outstanding at december  and  respectively  under our million senior secured revolving line of credit 
since  mobile mini has focused the growth of its business on its leasing operations 
leasing is a capital intensive business that requires that we acquire assets before they generate revenues  cash flow and earnings 
the assets mobile mini leases have very long useful lives and require relatively little recurrent maintenance expenditures 
most of the capital mobile mini has deployed into its leasing business has been of a discretionary nature in order to expand the company s operations geographically  to increase the number of units available for lease at the company s leasing locations  and to add to the mix of products the company offers 
during recent years  mobile mini s operations have generated cash flow that exceeds the company s pre tax earnings  particularly due to the deferral of income taxes due to accelerated depreciation which is used for tax accounting 
historically  mobile mini has funded much of its growth through equity and debt issuances and borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
recently  mobile mini has been able to fund more of its capital expenditures from operating cash flow  and during mobile mini funded a good portion of its million of capital expenditures with operating cash flow of million 
borrowings under its revolving credit facility increased in the aggregate by million between december  and december  operating activities 
our operations provided net cash flow of million after payment of an million judgment relating to certain litigation in florida in compared to million in and million in the million decrease in over in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to payment of the million judgment and to increases in accounts receivables and in inventory primarily raw materials and supplies  deposits and prepaid expenses  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable 
cash provided by operating activities is enhanced by the rapid tax depreciation rate of our assets and our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  which minimizes our tax payments at this time 
at december  we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately million and a deferred tax liability of million 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in in  million of cash was paid for acquisition of a business  compared to million in period and million in capital expenditures for our lease fleet were million for  million for and million in capital expenditures increased during due to an increase in demand which required us to purchase and refurbish more containers and offices than in and due to an increase in the cost of used shipping containers and modular offices  as well as the price of raw materials  especially steel 
during the past several years  our fleet has become more customized  enabling us to differentiate our product from our competitors product 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million in  million in and million in the amount of cash that we use during any period in investing activities is almost entirely within management s discretion 
mobile mini has no contracts or other arrangements pursuant to which we are required to purchase a fixed or minimum amount of goods or services in connection with any portion of our business 
our maintenance capital expenditures during were approximately million  to cover the cost to replace old forklifts  trucks and trailers that we use to move and deliver our products to our customers  and for enhancements to our computer information systems 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in  and million in during  we primarily relied on cash provided by operations as well as our credit facility to provide the additional cash needed to fund the growth of our lease fleet 
additionally  we received million from the exercises of employee stock options 
in  mobile mini completed an offering of million of senior notes due and  at the same time  amended its revolving credit facility to revise certain covenants 
the net proceeds of the senior notes offering were used in part to unwind certain interest rate swap agreements approximately million that had been entered into to hedge floating rate indebtedness outstanding under the revolving credit facility prior to the transaction  and the remainder of the net proceeds was used to repay borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
upon the closing of the transactions  most of mobile mini s outstanding debt was fixed rate debt  and the amount of unused borrowings available to mobile mini under the revolving credit facility increased to approximately million 
we used million less cash in financing activities during as compared to  primarily as a result of our strategic decision to forego most business acquisition opportunities during in order to focus on growing our existing branch network 
as of december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility  and 
table of contents approximately million of additional borrowings were available to us under the facility 
as of march   our borrowings outstanding under our credit facility were approximately million 
this increase is primarily due to the semi annual interest payment on the senior notes in january million 
the interest rate under our revolving credit facility is based on our ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization  debt restructuring expenses and any judgment or settlement costs related to our florida litigation 
in august  we amended our senior secured revolving line of credit to reduce the interest rate by reducing the spread over libor which we pay at various levels of leverage 
the interest rate  as calculated at december   under our credit facility is the libor london interbank offered rate rate plus or the prime rate plus  whichever we elect  subject to certain conditions 
all of our obligations under the revolving credit facility are unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally by each of our subsidiaries 
the revolving credit facility and the related guarantees are secured by substantially all of our assets and all assets of each guarantor  including but not limited to i a first priority pledge of all of the outstanding capital stock or other ownership interest owned by us and each guarantor and ii first priority security interests in all of our tangible and intangible assets and the tangible and intangible assets of each guarantor in each case  other than certain equipment assets subject to capitalized lease obligations 
as of december   we had no capital lease obligations 
loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate based  at our option and subject to certain conditions  on either the prime rate plus a spread ranging from nil to depending on our leverage ratio  or the london inter bank offered rate  which we refer to as libor  plus a spread ranging from to depending on our leverage ratio 
interest on outstanding borrowings is payable monthly or  with respect to libor borrowings  either quarterly or on the last day of the applicable interest period whichever is more frequent 
in addition to paying interest on any outstanding principal amount  we pay an unused revolving credit facility fee to the senior lenders equal to a range of to per annum on the unused daily balance of the revolving credit commitment  payable monthly in arrears  based upon the actual number of days elapsed in a day year 
for each letter of credit we issue  we pay i a per annum fee equal to the margin over the libor rate from time to time in effect  ii a fronting fee on the aggregate outstanding stated amounts of such letters of credit  plus iii customary administrative charges 
the credit facility documentation contains covenants restricting our ability to  among others i declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock  ii prepay  redeem or purchase other debt  iii incur liens  iv make loans and investments  v incur additional indebtedness  vi amend or otherwise alter debt and other material agreements  vii make capital expenditures  viii engage in mergers  acquisitions and asset sales  ix transact with affiliates  and x alter the business we conduct 
we also must comply with specified financial covenants and affirmative covenants 
these financial covenants set maximum values for mobile mini s leverage  fixed charge coverage  capital expenditures  and minimum values for lease fleet utilization rates 
the leverage or debt ratio covenant requires that our ratio of funded debt to ebitda as defined in our revolving credit agreement not exceed a specified ratio  which is to currently and which decreases to to at december  and thereafter 
ebitda for purposes of this covenant i includes our net income plus the amount of any non cash extraordinary losses and debt restructuring costs arising from payments of termination costs of interest rate swaps and from write offs of fees and expenses in connection with the initial funding under the loan and security agreement and ii gives pro forma effect to any permitted acquisition  in each case measured over our fiscal quarters ending on each quarterly measurement date 
our debt ratio covenant excludes all accruals and payments made by us in connection with our florida litigation  which was concluded in our fixed charge coverage ratio is required to be at least to and is defined as the ratio of our cash flow for four quarters to the sum of interest expense for such four quarters plus the current portion of our funded debt  but the calculation excludes accruals or cash payments made in connection with our florida litigation 
our capital expenditure covenant limits our permitted payments made in connection with the acquisition of fixed assets to million per year  as adjusted by annual carry forward amounts plus an amount equal to of the net cash proceeds we receive from any issuance of our equity securities 
portable containers held for sale and inventory and equipment acquired in connection with acquisition permitted under our revolving credit agreement are excluded from the capital expenditures covenant limitation 
our lease fleet utilization covenant requires us to maintain minimum utilization ranging from to  depending upon the fiscal quarter that is the measurement period 
the credit facility also contains limitations on  among other things  incurring debt  granting liens  making investments  making restricted payments  entering into transactions with affiliates and prepaying subordinated debt 
our compliance with financial covenants is measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter 
we were in compliance with all the covenants under the revolving credit facility agreement at december  events of default under the revolving credit facility include  but are not limited to  i our failure to pay principal or interest when due  ii our material breach of any representations or warranty  iii covenant defaults  iv events of bankruptcy  v cross default to certain other debt  vi certain unsatisfied final judgments over a stated threshold amount  and vii a change of control 

table of contents prior to june  we entered into interest rate swap agreements under which we effectively fixed the interest rate payable on million of borrowings under our credit facility so that the rate is based upon a spread from fixed rates  rather than a spread from the libor rate 
in june  in conjunction with our sale of our senior notes and the amendment of our credit facility  we terminated million of these swap agreements 
accounting for these swap agreements is covered by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 and pursuant to sfas no 
 the swap termination resulted in a charge to net income of approximately million  net of an income tax benefit of approximately million at june  at december  and  we had one interest rate swap agreement for million of debt 
in january  we entered into another interest rate swap agreement for an additional million of debt 
at december   a majority of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at fixed rates or the rate is effectively fixed due to a swap agreement  and approximately million of borrowings under our credit facility are variable rate 
mobile mini believes that it has sufficient borrowings available under the facility to provide for its foreseeable capital needs over the next to months  with the duration dependent in large part upon the balance between the internal growth rates achieved during and subsequent periods and the expenses of entry into additional markets during the period  which will be the main determinant of how quickly the company uses its additional borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility 
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations primarily consist of our outstanding balance under our secured revolving credit facility and million of unsecured senior notes  together with other notes payable obligations both secured and unsecured 
we also have operating lease commitments for real estate properties for the majority of our branches with remaining lease terms on our major leased properties ranging from to years  delivery  transportation and yard equipment  typically under a five year lease with purchase options at the end of the lease term at a stated or fair market value price  and other equipment  primarily office machines 
in connection with the issuance of our insurance policies  we have provided our various insurance carriers approximately million in letters of credit and an agreement under which we are contingently responsible for million to provide credit support for our payment of the deductibles and or loss limitation reimbursements under the insurance policies 
we currently do not have any obligations under purchase agreements or commitments 
historically  we enter into capitalized lease obligations from time to time to purchase delivery  transportation and yard equipment  but currently have no commitments recorded as a capital lease 
the table below provides a summary of our contractual commitments as of december  the operating lease amounts include the extended terms on real estate lease option renewals on those properties we currently anticipate we will exercise at the end of the lease term

seasonality demand from some of our customers is somewhat seasonal 
demand for leases of our portable storage units by large retailers is stronger from september through december because these retailers need to store more inventory for the holiday season 
our retail customers usually return these leased units to us early in the following year 
this causes lower utilization rates for our lease fleet and a marginal decrease in cash flow during the first quarter of the year 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  some of which require significant judgment 
mobile mini s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon our evaluation of historical results and anticipated future events  and these estimates may change as additional information becomes available 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to our financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates 
management believes that our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition 
lease and leasing ancillary revenues and related expenses generated under portable storage units and office units are recognized monthly  which approximates a straight line basis 
revenues and expenses from portable storage unit delivery and hauling are recognized when these services are billed  in accordance with sab  as amended by sab we recognize revenues from sales of containers and office units upon delivery 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we establish and maintain reserves against estimated losses based upon historical loss experience and evaluation of past due accounts agings 
management reviews the level of the allowances for doubtful accounts on a regular basis and adjusts the level of the allowances as needed 
if we were to increase the factors used for our reserve estimates by  it would have the following approximate effect on our net income and diluted earnings per share at december  as follows years ended december  as reported net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for hypothetical change in reserve estimates net income diluted earnings per share if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents impairment of goodwill 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical  expected or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  our market capitalization relative to net book value  and significant negative industry or general economic trends 
when we determine the carrying value of goodwill and other identified intangibles may not be recoverable  we measure impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   we ceased amortizing goodwill arising from acquisitions completed prior to july  we tested goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
we performed the annual required impairment tests for goodwill at december   december  and december   and determined that the carrying amount of goodwill was not impaired as of those dates 
we will perform this test in the future as required by sfas no 
impairment long lived assets 
we review property  plant and equipment and intangibles with finite lives those assets resulting from acquisitions for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for its estimates of future cash flows 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  whether due to new information or other factors  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
depreciation policy 
our depreciation policy for our lease fleet uses the straight line method over our units estimated useful life  after the date that we put the unit in service 
our steel units are depreciated over years with an estimated residual value of 
wood offices units are depreciated over years with an estimated residual value of 
van trailers  which are a small part of our fleet  are depreciated over years to a residual value 
van trailers are only added to the fleet as a result of acquisitions of portable storage businesses 
in  our depreciation policy on our steel units was modified to increase the useful life to years from years  and to decrease the residual value to from  which effectively resulted in continued depreciation on steel units for five additional years at the same annual rate 
this change was made to reflect that some of our steel units have now been in our lease fleet longer than years and these units continue to be effective income producing assets that do not show signs of reaching the end of their useful life 
the depreciation policy is supported by our historical lease fleet data that shows we have been able to retain comparable rental rates and sales prices irrespective of the age of the unit in our container lease fleet 

table of contents we periodically review our depreciation policy against various factors  including the results of our lenders independent appraisal of our lease fleet  practices of the larger competitors in our industry  profit margins we are achieving on sales of depreciated units and lease rates we obtain on older units 
if we were to change our depreciation policy on our steel units from residual value and a year life to a lower or higher residual and a shorter or longer useful life  such change could have a positive  negative or neutral effect on our earnings  with the actual effect being determined by the change 
for example  a change in our estimates used in our residual values and useful life would have the following approximate effect on our net income and diluted earnings per share as reflected in the table below 
useful residual life in value years as reported net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share insurance reserves 
our worker s compensation  auto and general liability insurance is purchased under large deductible programs 
our current per incident deductibles are worker s compensation  auto  and general liability  we expense the deductible portion of the individual claims 
however  we generally do not know the full amount of our exposure to a deductible in connection with any particular claim during the fiscal period in which the claim is incurred and for which we must make an accrual for the deductible expense 
we make these accruals based on a combination of the claims development experience of our staff and our insurance companies  and  at year end  the accrual is reviewed and adjusted  in part  based on an independent actuarial review of historical loss data and using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry 
a high degree of judgment is required in developing these estimates of amounts to be accrued  as well as in connection with the underlying assumptions 
in addition  our assumptions will change as our loss experience is developed 
all of these factors have the potential for significantly impacting the amounts we have previously reserved in respect of anticipated deductible expenses  and we may be required in the future to increase or decrease amounts previously accrued 
contingencies 
we are a party to various claims and litigation in the normal course of business 
management s current estimated range of liability related to various claims and pending litigation is based on claims for which our management can determine that it is probable as that term is defined in sfas no 
that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
because of the uncertainties related to both the probability of incurred and possible range of loss on pending claims and litigation  management must use considerable judgment in making reasonable determination of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation 
we do not anticipate the resolution of such matters known at this time will have a material adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial position 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements sfas no 
 revised sfas no 
r  share based payment  was issued in december sfas no 
r is a revision of fasb statement  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance  which allowed companies to use the intrinsic method of valuing share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity with share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value method as defined in statement pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  as permitted by statement  we currently account for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method is expected to have an impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial condition 
the impact upon adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future  the valuation model used to value the options and other variables 
sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  was issued in november sfas no 
clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead 
further  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed and production facilities overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate swap agreement 
we seek to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates through a financial arrangement intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility 
we continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged 
interest rate swap agreements are the only instruments we use to manage interest rate fluctuations affecting our variable rate debt 
at december   we had one interest rate swap agreement under which we pay a fixed rate and receive a variable interest rate on million of debt 
in  in accordance with sfas no 
 comprehensive income included million  net of income tax expense of million  related to the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements

table of contents we enter into derivative financial arrangements only to the extent that the arrangement meets the objectives described above  and we do not engage in such transactions for speculative purposes 
impact of foreign currency rate changes 
we currently have branch operations in toronto  canada  and we invoice those customers primarily in the local currency  the canadian dollar  under the terms of our lease agreements with those customers 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our canadian branch operation are translated into us dollars 
the impact of foreign currency rate changes have historically been insignificant
