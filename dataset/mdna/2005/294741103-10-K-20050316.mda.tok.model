table of contents funds from operations a reconciliation of this non gaap financial measure to net income  the most directly comparable gaap measure 
executive summary equity office properties trust equity office is the largest owner of office properties in the nation  based on market capitalization and square footage 
we own  manage  lease  acquire and develop office properties 
as of december   we owned office properties in metropolitan areas including our core markets which are atlanta  austin  boston  chicago  denver  los angeles  oakland east bay  orange county  new york  portland  sacramento  san diego  san francisco  san jose  seattle  stamford and washington  dc we believe our core markets have the following characteristics an intellectual and cultural infrastructure  a highly educated workforce  higher average occupancy over time  strong prospects for us to be a market leader  the ability to leverage our operating platform  and sufficient size to grow 
we manage our properties on a portfolio wide basis as compared to more traditional real estate owners who operate on a property by property basis 
we believe this portfolio based approach to operating real estate allows us to operate efficiently while providing a high level of service to our tenants 
our operating platform  which includes centralized regional offices and procurement functions  allows us increased opportunities to provide a wide range of solutions to our tenants with local  regional or national office space needs  streamline operations  improve customer service  retain tenants  increase occupancy and reduce operating expenses 
the following areas affect our office business and are important factors to consider when reviewing our financial and operating results economic environment leasing results for the total office portfolio investment activity cash requirements economic environment over the past few years  an economic slowdown coupled with slow employment growth and increased office vacancy in the united states have adversely impacted our financial results 
these trends are beginning to reverse in certain of our markets with office vacancy beginning to decline and rental rates beginning to recover  primarily because of an increase in office job growth as the economy recovers and an increase in positive net absorption of office space 
office job growth is the principal driver for the demand for our properties 
we are beginning to see indications of an economic recovery with notable office job growth 
at the same time  the pace of construction of office buildings  an important market variable driving supply of space  has slowed with new construction nationwide at its lowest level since in  office job growth and a lower construction pace contributed to positive net absorption of office space in all of our core markets for the first time since  the strongest of which was in washington  dc  new york  and los angeles 
as a result of the foregoing  in we saw increased activity in the office market with vacancy rates nationwide declining gradually with the largest improvement in class a office properties and more specifically in class a suburban office properties 
this is consistent with the flight to quality trend typically seen in the early stages of an economic recovery 
the market recovery we have started to experience will take some time to translate into improved deal economics and enhanced operating results for office property owners 
therefore  assuming the recovery is sustained  it will be a slow transition from the conditions we experienced over the past few years with uneven recoveries in different markets 

table of contents leasing results for the total office portfolio the gross square footage for tenants who took occupancy in and was approximately million and million  respectively 
we ended with occupancy of  up incrementally from at year end the following chart shows our occupancy trends over the past five years with the peak vacancy in we currently anticipate the leasing environment will continue to improve and estimate occupancy will be in the to range at year end graph rental rates declined during by approximately on a cash basis as new leases replaced expiring and terminated leases 
market rents began to trend down beginning in as vacancy rates increased across the nation 
while we have been able to increase rental rates in select areas  we expect it to take time for pricing power to improve across the portfolio 
we estimate that rental rates on our leases that are scheduled to expire in are approximately to above current market 
this roll down in rents to current market levels adversely affects our rental revenues  and until market rental rates increase substantially from their current levels  we expect it to adversely affect our rental revenues in subsequent periods as we enter into new leases 
while tenant improvement and lease commission costs have been at historically high levels  we are seeing them stabilize and expect these costs to range from to per square foot in  similar to levels in late and early lease terminations decreased from approximately million square feet in to approximately million square feet in while it is difficult to predict future terminations  we expect the number on a square footage basis to continue to decline in as compared to we are seeing more planned terminations versus defaults and expect lease termination fees to be slightly higher in than primarily because of one large termination fee in early investment activity in  we were a net acquirer of real estate  purchasing whole or partial interests in office properties  four land parcels  and economic interests in three properties which we already partially owned from partners  for a total of million 
we sold million of assets with the largest transaction attributed to the sale of almost all our industrial properties 
we anticipate that in  market conditions will continue to favor asset sales and we expect to continue to take advantage of this opportunity to strengthen our portfolio by disposing of non core assets in core markets and assets in non core markets 
to the extent that we become a net seller of real estate  it may reduce our net income and funds from operations 
as we sell properties we may incur gains or losses and may also incur impairment charges  some of which could be material  as a result of either sales  changes in market conditions or changes in holding periods 
we have several options to utilize proceeds from asset sales in  which include acquiring assets in our targeted core markets  repaying debt  buying back our shares  returning proceeds to our investors in the form of a special dividend  or some combination of these options 
should the level of dispositions in be significant  the impact of such sales on our operating results and financial condition will depend to a great extent on the manner and timing of our utilization of the sales proceeds 

table of contents cash requirements as discussed later in the liquidity section  our net cash flow provided by operating activities was insufficient to meet all of our cash requirements including capital improvements  tenant improvements and leasing costs as well as distributions to our shareholders and unitholders during we funded this shortfall primarily with proceeds from financing activities 
if our net cash from operating activities and cash requirements  including tenant improvements and leasing costs continue at these levels  and if our board of trustees continues to declare distributions on our common shares at current levels  we expect that such shortfall will continue in and that we will cover the shortfall with proceeds from financing activities and asset sales 
key transactions completed in investing activities we acquired million in assets  or partial interests therein  consisting of office properties comprising approximately million square feet and four vacant land parcels  disposed of five office properties  comprising approximately 
million square feet  and partial interests in three office properties  and one vacant land parcel for approximately million  disposed of industrial properties  which was substantially our entire industrial property portfolio  comprising approximately million square feet for approximately million  and disposed of our investment in shares of capital trust for approximately million 
financing activities debt we issued approximately billion of fixed interest rate unsecured notes and million of variable interest rate unsecured notes in several offerings  and repaid billion of unsecured notes  and repaid approximately million of mortgage debt 
derivatives we settled million of forward starting interest rate swaps for a payment of approximately million and then entered into several fixed to floating interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on billion of unsecured notes issued in march to a floating rate of libor plus basis points which includes basis points for loan costs  and settled five forward starting interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of million resulting in a gain of approximately million 
the swaps were entered into in to hedge an unsecured notes offering that was expected to take place in june  but did not occur 
other we recorded a non cash impairment charge of approximately million on non core assets  redeemed the series c cumulative redeemable preferred shares of beneficial interest for approximately million  consolidated the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the sunamerica center office property as of january  in accordance with fin r and recognized a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle loss of approximately million  and consolidated the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the concar office property in accordance with fin r 

table of contents results of operations trends in occupancy and rental rates for the total office portfolio below is a summary of leasing activity for tenants taking occupancy in the periods presented 
our largest markets in terms of our property net operating income from continuing operations in order from greatest to least are boston  san francisco  san jose  new york  los angeles  seattle  chicago  washington  dc  atlanta and orange county 
these markets accounted for approximately of our total net operating income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of for the years ended december  total office portfolio data largest markets portion of total office portfolio based on square feet at end of year occupancy at end of year gross square footage for tenants whose lease term commenced during the year weighted average annual rent per square foot for tenants whose lease term commenced during the year gaap basis a b cash basis b c gross square footage for expiring and terminated leases during the year weighted average annual rent per square foot for expiring and terminated leases during the year gaap basis a cash basis c total office portfolio occupancy at end of year gross square footage for tenants whose lease term commenced during the year weighted average annual rent per square foot for tenants whose lease term commenced during the year gaap basis a b cash basis b c gross square footage for expiring and terminated leases during the year weighted average annual rent per square foot for expiring and terminated leases during the year gaap basis a cash basis c a these weighted average gaap rental rates are based on the average annual base rent per square foot over the term of each lease and the current estimated tenant reimbursements  if any 
b weighted average annual rent per square foot for new office leases for tenants whose lease term commenced during the period may lag behind market because leasing decisions typically are made anywhere from one month to or more months prior to taking occupancy 
c these weighted average annual cash rental rates are based on the monthly contractual rent when the lease commenced  expired or terminated

this amount reflects total base rent and estimated current period expense reimbursements without regard to any rent concessions and contractual increases

we believe annualized cash rent is a useful measure because this information can be used for comparison to current market rents as published by various third party sources

results of operations the financial data presented in the consolidated statements of operations show significant changes in revenues and expenses from period to period 
we do not believe our period to period financial data are necessarily comparable because we acquire and dispose of properties on an ongoing basis 
the following tables show condensed consolidated results attributable to the properties that were held during both periods being compared the same store portfolio and the changes in our condensed consolidated statements of operation  which includes corporate level items the total company 
the significant differences between the same store portfolio and the total company are the following transactions  which are only reflected in the total company the consolidation of avenue of the americas  sunamerica center and concar in  the consolidation of key center in the third quarter of  the acquisition of two office buildings comprising approximately million square feet in and office buildings comprising approximately million square feet in  certain developments placed in service  and the disposition of properties comprising approximately million square feet and the sale of majority interests in properties which are now accounted for under the equity method in  the

c represents segment data 
see item note property operating revenues property operating revenues in the same store portfolio decreased in because of a decrease in rental rates on new and renewal leases as compared to expiring leases 
in addition  income from lease terminations decreased in by approximately million 
average occupancy rates in the same store portfolio decreased in as compared to which also contributed to the decrease in property operating revenues in property operating revenues in the total company increased because of the consolidation of certain properties  acquisitions and developments placed in service  which together increased property operating revenues by approximately million 
the increases in property operating revenues from to were partially offset by the partial sales of properties in and  which accounted for approximately million of the change in revenue and the decreases in the same store portfolio  as explained above 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense in the same store portfolio increased in because of capital and tenant improvements placed in service since the beginning of the prior period and an increase in deferred leasing costs 
depreciation and amortization expense in the total company increased in as a result of the consolidation of certain properties and acquisitions and increases in the same store portfolio  as explained above 
the increases were partially offset by the partial sales of properties in and real estate taxes real estate taxes increased in in the same store portfolio because of an increase in estimated taxes at our properties located in california of approximately million which was partially offset by lower real estate taxes as a result of lower tax assessments of our boston properties of approximately million 
we anticipate real estate taxes to continue to fluctuate based on changes in property assessments and tax rates by the taxing authorities 
real estate taxes increased in in the total company as a result of the consolidation of certain properties and acquisitions and increases in the same store portfolio as explained above 
the increases were partially offset by the partial sales of properties in and 
table of contents property operating expenses property operating expenses increased in in the same store portfolio because of increases in utility expenses of approximately million  repairs and maintenance expenses of approximately million  and insurance expense of approximately million 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in other property operating expense of approximately million 
the increase in utility expense was primarily due to general increases in rates charged by the utility suppliers and also from settlements of utility contracts in  which had the effect of reducing utility expense in repairs and maintenance increased primarily because we expanded our preventive maintenance program in in an effort to reduce future emergency repairs 
property operating expenses increased in in the total company because of the consolidation of certain properties and acquisitions and increases in the same store portfolio as explained above 
the increases were partially offset by the partial sales of properties in and ground rent the increase in in ground rent for the total company was primarily caused by the consolidation of concar see item note 
general and administrative expenses the decrease in in general and administrative expense was caused by a decrease in consulting expenses of approximately million relating to a project that ended in impairment the impairment charge in related to non core assets and is discussed in detail in item note the impairment charge recognized in related to an office property and is also further discussed in item note for a listing of the impaired properties refer to item schedule iii 
interest and dividend income interest and dividend income decreased in in the total company primarily as a result of lower interest and dividends from various notes receivable and investments  which either matured or were redeemed during the period 
realized gain on settlement of derivatives and sale of marketable securities the increase from the prior year in the total company was primarily due to the million gain recorded in when we settled certain interest rate swaps 
in  we also recognized gains of approximately million due to the disposition of our investment in shares of capital trust this was a related party transaction  see item note and approximately million from the sale of other securities 
the gain in was primarily from the sale of common stock received in connection with a lease termination in interest expense interest expense decreased in in the same store portfolio because of mortgage debt repayments 
interest expense increased in the total company because of the consolidation of certain properties  which accounted for approximately million of the increase  and the write off of million of unamortized loan costs in connection with the early redemption of certain unsecured notes 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in our weighted average interest rates resulting from having more floating rate debt than fixed rate debt outstanding as compared to the prior year 
in addition  the interest rates on the unsecured notes issued in were lower than the interest rates on the debt repaid in 
table of contents income from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures income from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures in the same store portfolio decreased primarily because of reduced occupancy and lower average rental rates on new leases as compared to average rental rates on expiring leases 
in addition  interest expense increased as a result of the refinancing of a property at a higher loan balance during income from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures in the total company decreased primarily because of the consolidation of avenue of the americas  key center and concar and decreases in the same store portfolio as explained above 
in  the net income from these properties was included in income from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 
in addition  we sold our interest in foundry square iv and recognized a gain of approximately million which was included in income from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures in this decrease was partially offset by the properties that were partially sold in and as they are now accounted for under the equity method 
gain on sales of real estate the gain in related to the partial sale of our interests in and market street located in philadelphia  pa 
the gain in related to the partial sale of our interests in office properties 
in accordance with fas  the net income from these properties  which includes the gain on sale  is not classified as discontinued operations because we maintain an ongoing involvement with the operation of these properties 
discontinued operations the decrease in discontinued operations was a result of the loss of net income due to sales of properties and a lower net gain on the sale of properties in as compared to discontinued operations in includes the net income of properties sold in and  whereas the discontinued operations in only includes the net income of properties sold in see item note for a summary of the results of operations of properties sold 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle under the provisions of fin r  we consolidated the assets  liabilities and results of operations of sunamerica center effective january   and recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting in a loss of approximately million

c represents segment data 
see item note property operating revenues property operating revenues in the total company decreased in primarily because of reduced occupancy in the same store portfolio from at january  to at december   and a decrease in lease termination fees 
a large portion of the decrease in occupancy was due to early lease terminations 
in addition to the decline in occupancy  rental revenues declined as a result of lower average rental rates on new leases as compared to average rental rates on expiring leases 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense in the total company and the same store portfolio increased in because of capital and tenant improvements placed in service since the beginning of the prior period and from an increase in deferred leasing costs 
real estate taxes real estate taxes decreased in in the total company and the same store portfolio because of a decrease in real estate taxes at our properties located in the california region of approximately million and in the seattle region of approximately million  partially offset by an increase in real estate taxes in the new york region of approximately million 
property operating expenses property operating expenses in in the same store portfolio  decreased primarily because of lower utility expenses of approximately million and lower insurance expenses of approximately million 
insurance expenses decreased primarily as a result of changes in our insurance program and favorable loss experience 
in addition  repairs and maintenance expenses decreased by approximately million primarily due to lower occupancy and the renegotiation of service contracts 
payroll expenses decreased by approximately million due to staff reductions 
these decreases in property operating expenses were partially offset by increases in property operating general and administrative expenses which include legal  advertising  leasing and payroll costs and by severance expense of approximately million in general and administrative expenses we incurred approximately million of corporate level severance expense in compared to million in the severance expense consisted of the accelerated vesting of share options and restricted shares as well as cash payments 

table of contents beginning in fiscal  we reclassified regional operating expenses and other costs directly associated with property operations from general and administrative expenses to property operating expenses 
the regional offices exist to provide oversight for the management and leasing of the properties 
accordingly  these expenses were classified as property operating expenses and all prior periods have been reclassified to provide for comparability 
this reclassification did not change the prior period results or shareholders equity 
impairment the impairment charge recognized in related to an office property and is further discussed in item note interest and dividend income interest and dividend income decreased in in the total company by approximately million primarily as a result of lower interest and dividends from various notes receivable and investments  which either matured or were redeemed during the period

see income from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures below 
income from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures income from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures decreased in the total company primarily because of a decrease in lease termination fees from approximately million to approximately million and a decrease in property operating revenues in the same store portfolio  partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense on variable rate mortgage debt in the same store portfolio and by a development property placed in service during the decrease in property operating revenues in the same store portfolio was primarily because of reduced occupancy and decreased average rental rates on new leases as compared to average rental rates on expiring leases

in accordance with fas  the net income from these properties  which includes the gain on sale  is not classified as discontinued operations because we maintain an ongoing involvement with the operation of these properties

table of contents includes the net income of properties sold in and see item note for a summary of the results of operations of properties sold 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity our net cash provided by operating activities is primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our properties  the rental rates on our leases  the collectibility of rent from our tenants and the level of operating and other expenses 
our line of credit and our net cash provided by operating activities have been our primary sources of liquidity to fund our cash requirements which include capital improvements  tenant improvements and leasing costs for operating properties  as well as distributions to our shareholders and unitholders 
a material adverse change in our net cash provided by operating activities may affect our ability to fund these items and may affect the financial performance covenants under our line of credit and unsecured notes 
if we fail to meet our financial performance covenants and are unable to reach a satisfactory resolution with our lenders  the maturity dates for our unsecured notes could be accelerated  our line of credit could become unavailable to us and the interest charged on the line of credit could increase 
any of these circumstances could also adversely affect our ability to fund these items 
moodys  standard poor s and fitch provide credit ratings on our unsecured notes and preferred stock 
in july  moodys downgraded our credit ratings from baa to baa with a stable outlook 
standard poor s and fitch have retained our credit ratings at bbb with a stable outlook 
if standard poor s or fitch downgrades our credit ratings  the interest rate charged on our line of credit will increase 
in addition  the interest rate associated with any future financings may be impacted if our credit ratings decline 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we must distribute an amount equal to at least of our taxable income excluding capital gains to our shareholders 
we currently distribute amounts attributable to capital gains to our shareholders  however  these amounts can be retained by us and taxed at the corporate tax rate 
accordingly  we currently intend  although we are not legally obligated  to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common and preferred shares  at least at the level required to maintain our reit status 
the declaration of distributions on capital shares is at the discretion of the board of trustees  which decision is made quarterly by the board of trustees based on then prevailing circumstances 
lower occupancy levels  reduced rental rates  and reduced revenues as a result of asset sales have had the effect of reducing our net cash provided by operating activities 
in addition  our tenant improvement and leasing costs have increased as compared to historical levels due to competitive market conditions for new and renewal leases 
during the year ended december   our net cash provided by operating activities was insufficient to pay all our cash requirements including capital improvements  tenant improvement and leasing costs and distributions to our shareholders and unitholders 
we funded this shortfall primarily with proceeds from financing activities 
if our net cash from operating activities and tenant improvement and leasing costs continue at these levels  and if our board of trustees continues to declare distributions on our common shares at current levels  we expect that such shortfall will continue in and that we will need to cover the shortfall with proceeds from financing activities and asset sales 
as of december   we had approximately billion of secured and unsecured debt maturing in  which excludes scheduled principal payments prior to maturity 
should our board of trustees continue to declare distributions at current levels  we will not be able to retain sufficient cash to repay all of our debt as it comes due using only cash from operating activities and we will be required to repay most of our maturing debt with proceeds from asset sales and debt offerings 

table of contents we believe that net cash provided by operating activities  draws under our line of credit  proceeds from other financing sources that we expect to be available to us and proceeds from asset sales will together provide sufficient liquidity to meet our cash needs during  although there can be no assurance that such financing at acceptable terms will be available to us

fixed to floating interest rate swaps see item note for information on fixed to floating interest rate swaps 
energy contracts in an ongoing effort to control energy costs  from time to time we enter into contracts for the purchase of gas or electricity for properties in states which have deregulated energy markets 
typically  the terms of the contracts range from of one to five years 
although all or a portion of the commodity price under these contracts is generally fixed  the amounts actually expended under these contracts will vary in accordance with 
table of contents actual energy usage or the timing of energy usage during the period 
as a result  the amounts to be expended under these contracts are difficult to predict 
our failure to purchase the amount of energy for which we have contractual commitments could result in penalties  depending on market conditions  some of which could be material

table of contents the americas 
these two properties were encumbered by approximately million of mortgage debt when they were consolidated 
this increase was partially offset by million of repayments 
b the increase in unsecured notes and line of credit was due to the issuance of billion of new notes and million of net borrowings on the line of credit 
these increases were partially offset by billion of note repayments and additional discounts on the notes primarily due to mark to market adjustments on fair value interest rate swaps 
c the variable rate debt as of december  includes billion of fixed rate unsecured notes that were converted to a variable rate based on libor plus basis points through several interest rate swap agreements entered into in march the interest rates for the remaining variable rate debt are based on various spreads over libor 
unconsolidated joint venture mortgage debt our share of unconsolidated joint venture mortgage debt was approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the decrease of approximately million was primarily due to the consolidation of avenue of the americas of which our share of the mortgage debt was approximately million 
the instruments encumbering the properties restrict title transfer of the respective properties subject to the terms of the mortgage  prohibit additional liens  require payment of real estate taxes on the properties  require maintenance of the properties in good condition  require maintenance of insurance on the properties and include a requirement to obtain lender consent to enter into material tenant leases 
line of credit we have a billion revolving credit facility that was obtained in may and matures in may as of december   million was outstanding under this facility 
the line of credit bears interest at libor plus basis points  but would increase in the event of an adverse change in our credit ratings from standard poor s or fitch 
the line of credit has an annual facility fee of basis points payable quarterly 
in addition  a competitive bid option  whereby the lenders participating in the credit facility may bid on the interest to be charged resulting in an interest rate lower than libor plus basis points  is available for up to million of the borrowings under the credit facility 
the effective rate on the line of credit at december  was approximately 
we utilize our line of credit  together with net cash provided by operating activities  to fund capital improvements  tenant improvement and leasing costs  distributions to our shareholders and unitholders  financing and investing activities and for other general working capital purposes 
as a result of the nature and timing of the draws  the outstanding balance on our line of credit is subject to ongoing fluctuation and amounts outstanding under the line of credit may from time to time be significant 
for example  during the amount of indebtedness outstanding under the line of credit ranged from to billion  with a balance of million as of december  we consider all such borrowings to be in the ordinary course of our business and would expect similar fluctuations in the outstanding balance under the line of credit during bridge revolving credit facility in december  we obtained a billion day credit facility which bore interest at libor plus basis points and had an annual facility fee of million payable quarterly 
the day credit facility was terminated in march in july  we obtained a million day bridge revolving credit facility 
the credit facility bore interest at libor plus basis points and had an annual facility fee of basis points 
amounts borrowed under the facility are required to be repaid with certain cash proceeds from property sales and any cash proceeds from debt and equity offerings 
this facility was terminated in october following our billion unsecured notes offering

restrictions and covenants under unsecured indebtedness the terms of our line of credit and unsecured notes contain various financial covenants which require satisfaction of certain ratios including total debt to total assets  secured debt to total assets  debt service coverage ratios  unencumbered asset to unsecured debt as well as other limitations 
as of december   we believe we were in compliance with each of these financial covenants 
if we fail to comply with any of these covenants  then the indebtedness could become due and payable before its stated due date

market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating  investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows to fund debt service  acquisitions  capital expenditures  distributions to shareholders and other cash requirements 
the majority of our outstanding debt obligations maturing at various times through have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates 
we utilize certain derivative financial instruments at times to limit interest rate risk 
interest rate protection and swap agreements are used to convert fixed rate debt to a variable rate basis  to hedge anticipated financing transactions  or convert variable rate debt to a fixed rate basis 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
quantitative information about market risk interest rate risk the table below discloses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on interest expense for variable rate debt and the fair value of total outstanding debt 
interest risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt 
this analysis does not reflect the impact that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of economic activity 
further  in the event of a changing interest rate environment  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure 
table of contents to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no change in our financial structure

interest rate risk forward starting and fixed to floating interest rate swaps as of december   we had billion of forward starting interest rate swaps outstanding  which were all settled during the six months ended june  in march  in conjunction with a billion debt offering  we settled million of forward starting interest rate swaps that were outstanding as of december  in may we settled million notional amount of forward starting interest rate swaps and recognized a gain of approximately million 
the swaps were entered into in to hedge an unsecured note offering that was expected to take place in june  but did not occur 
as of december   the fair value of these swaps represented a net liability to us of approximately million approximately million is recorded in other assets and million is recorded in other liabilities 
the market value of the forward starting interest rate swaps is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads  which change over time 
if the market interest rates were basis points higher  the value of the swaps would have been an asset of approximately million at december  if the market interest rates were basis points lower  our liability under these swaps would have been approximately million at december  in march  we entered into billion of fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements to hedge the billion of unsecured notes also issued in march as of december   the fair value of these swaps represented a liability to us of approximately million and is classified in other liabilities 
if the market interest rates were basis points higher  our liability under these swaps would have been approximately million at december  if the market interest rates were basis points lower  the value of these swaps would have been an asset of approximately million at december  see item note for information on our forward starting and fixed to floating interest rate swaps 
capital improvements  tenant improvements and leasing costs capital improvements significant renovations and improvements  which improve or extend the useful life of our properties are capitalized 
we categorize these capital expenditures as follows capital improvements costs for improvements that enhance the value of the property such as lobby renovations  roof replacement  significant renovations for americans with disabilities act compliance  chiller replacement and elevator upgrades 
development and redevelopment costs costs associated with the development or redevelopment of a property including tenant improvements  leasing commissions  capitalized interest and operating costs incurred during completion of the property and incurred while the property is made ready for its intended use

table of contents there are no unconsolidated joint venture properties under development as of december  inflation substantially all of our office leases require the tenant to pay  as additional rent  all or a portion of real estate taxes and operating expenses 
in addition  many of our office leases provide for fixed increases in base rent or escalations indexed to the consumer price index or other measures 
we believe that a significant portion of increases in property operating expenses will be offset  in part  by expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above

the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to lower occupancy levels  reduced rental rates and reduced revenues as a result of asset sales 
investing activities net cash used for and provided by investing activities reflects the net impact of acquisitions and dispositions of properties  investments in and distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures including our acquisition of a interest in colorado center in for approximately million  and expenditures for capital improvements  tenant improvements and lease costs

preferred shares preferred shares decreased by approximately million due to the redemption of the series c preferred shares in the first quarter critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets  depreciation and amortization  and the fair value of financial instruments including derivative instruments  each of which we discuss below 
allowance for doubtful accounts rental revenue from our tenants is our principal source of revenue and is recognized in accordance with gaap based on the contractual terms of the leases 
we monitor the collectibility of accounts receivable from our tenants on an on going basis 
based on this analysis  historical experience and the current economic environment  we establish provisions  and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the possible inability of our tenants to make required rent payments to us 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded during each period and the associated bad debt expense is netted against rental revenue in our consolidated statements of operations 
the allowance for doubtful accounts  which represents the cumulative allowances less write offs of uncollectible rent  is netted against tenant and other receivables and deferred rent receivable on our consolidated balance sheets 
as a result of the slowdown in economic activity  we have continued to experience uncollectible receivables  although at lower levels than prior periods  relating to tenants in bankruptcy or tenants experiencing financial difficulty 
if we incorrectly estimate the required allowance for doubtful accounts  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
below is our bad debt expense from continuing operations for each of the three years in the period ended december  for the years ended december  dollars in thousands bad debt expense property operating revenues bad debt expense as a percentage of property operating revenues impairment of long lived assets we review our long lived assets for potential impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets fas 
under fas  an impairment loss must be recognized when the carrying value of a long lived asset is not recoverable 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if it is determined that a permanent impairment of a long lived asset has occurred  the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its fair value and an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value 
our estimate of the expected future cash flows used in testing for impairment is highly subjective and based on  among other things  our estimates regarding current and future market conditions  rental rates  occupancy levels  costs of tenant improvements  leasing commissions and other tenant concessions  assumptions regarding the residual value of our properties at the end of our anticipated holding period and the length of our anticipated holding period 
these assumptions could differ materially from actual results in future 
table of contents periods 
if our strategy changes or if market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material 
during  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of approximately million on non core assets comprising approximately million square feet 
during  we recognized an impairment of approximately million on an office property 
there were no impairments in see item note depreciation and amortization statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations fas was effective for business combinations initiated on or after july  depreciation expense on properties acquired prior to july  is computed using the straight line method based on an estimated useful life of approximately years 
a significant portion of the acquisition cost of each property was allocated to building usually to unless the property was subject to a ground lease in which case of the acquisition cost was allocated to building 
depreciation expense on properties acquired subsequent to the effective date of fas is based on the allocation of the acquisition cost to land  building  tenant improvements and intangibles and the determination of their useful lives are based on management s estimates 
if we do not appropriately allocate to these components or we incorrectly estimate the useful lives of these components  our computation of depreciation and amortization expense may not appropriately reflect the actual impact of these costs over future periods  which will affect net income 
fair value of financial instruments we are required to determine periodically the fair value of our mortgage debt and unsecured notes for disclosure purposes 
in the determination of these fair values  we use internally developed models that are based on our estimates of current market conditions 
we calculate the net present value of the difference between future contractual interest payments and future interest payments based on a current market rate 
we determine the current market rate by adding an estimated credit spread to the quoted yields on federal government debt securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt 
the credit spread estimates are based on our historical experience in obtaining either secured or unsecured financing and current market conditions 
in accordance with fas  the carrying values of interest rate swaps  as well as the underlying hedged liability  if applicable  are reflected at their fair value 
we rely on quotations from a third party to determine these fair values 
derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in the fair value of the hedged liability through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings 
because the valuations of our financial instruments are based on estimates  the fair value may change if our estimates are inaccurate 
for the effect of hypothetical changes in market interest rates on interest expense for variable rate debt  the fair value of total outstanding debt and our interest rate swaps  see the market risk section 
impact of new accounting standards and accounting standards recently adopted accounting policy recently adopted effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no

c the series b preferred shares are not dilutive to eps for each period presented and are not dilutive to ffo per share for the year ended december  but are dilutive to ffo per share for all other periods presented 
d ffo per share for the year ended december  includes a million non cash impairment charge  or 
per share on a diluted basis  recorded in the third quarter by definition  impairment charges are not added back to net income when calculating ffo 

table of contents ffo definition ffo is defined as net income  computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as one of several measures of the performance of an equity reit 
we further believe that by excluding the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other equity reits 
investors should review ffo  along with gaap net income when trying to understand a reit s operating performance 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  determined in accordance with gaap  as an indication of our financial performance  or to cash flow from operating activities  determined in accordance with gaap  as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions
