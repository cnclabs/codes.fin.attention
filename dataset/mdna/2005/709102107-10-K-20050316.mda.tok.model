our portfolio currently consists of properties in states and includes shopping malls including cumberland mall that was acquired in february  power and strip centers and four industrial properties 
the retail properties have a total of approximately million square feet  of which we and partnerships in which we own an interest own approximately million square feet 
we hold our interests in our portfolio of properties through our operating partnership  preit associates  lp preit associates 
we are the sole general partner of preit associates and  as of december   held an controlling interest in preit associates 
we consolidate preit associates for financial reporting purposes 
we hold our investments in seven of the retail properties in our portfolio through unconsolidated partnerships with third parties 
we hold a non controlling interest in each unconsolidated partnership  and account for them using the equity method of accounting 
we do not control any of these equity method investees for the following reasons except for one property that we co manage with our partner  all of the other entities are managed on a day to day basis by one of our other partners as the managing general partner in each of the respective partnerships 
in the case of the co managed property  all decisions in the ordinary course of business are made jointly 
the managing general partner is responsible for establishing the operating and capital decisions of the partnership  including budgets  in the ordinary course of business 
all major decisions of each partnership  such as the sale  refinancing  expansion or rehabilitation of the property require the approval of all partners 
voting rights and the sharing of profits and losses are generally in proportion to the ownership percentages of each partner 
we record the earnings from the unconsolidated partnerships using the equity method of accounting under the income statement caption entitled equity in income of partnerships rather than consolidating the results of the unconsolidated partnerships with our results 
changes in our investments in these entities are recorded in the balance sheet caption entitled investment in and advances to partnerships  at equity in the case of deficit investment balances  such amounts are recorded in investments in partnerships  deficit balances

of our seven unconsolidated properties  we co manage one of the properties and partners or their affiliates manage the remaining six properties 
one of our key strategic long term objectives is to obtain managerial control of all of our assets 
due to the nature of our existing partnership arrangements  we cannot anticipate when this objective will be achieved  if at all 
in  we transformed our strategic focus to the retail sector by merging with crown american realty trust crown  which owned shopping malls and a interest in palmer park mall in easton  pennsylvania  and by acquiring six shopping malls in the philadelphia area from the rouse company  along with several other retail property acquisitions that are discussed below 
our merger and acquisition activities were primarily financed using the proceeds from the disposition of our property multifamily portfolio  the issuance of  common shares through a public offering  a new million unsecured revolving credit facility  two new mortgage financings  and the issuance of common and preferred shares and units in our operating partnership op units in connection with the crown merger 
we have incurred significant expenses related to the integration of the business and properties we acquired for consulting  compensation and other services 
as a result of the completion of our merger with crown and other acquisition activities  we recognized expenses of million and million through december  and  respectively 
the costs were primarily for severance payments  incentive compensation  integration consulting and costs associated with closing crown s former headquarters 

back to contents our revenues consist primarily of fixed rental income and additional rent in the form of expense reimbursements and percentage rents rents that are based on a percentage of our tenants sales or a percentage of sales in excess of thresholds that are specified in the leases derived from our income producing retail properties

the committee obtained an independent appraisal and found the purchase price to be fair to the company 
the committee also approved the reduction of the fee payable by cumberland mall associates to pri under the existing management agreement upon the sale of the mall from of the purchase price to of the purchase price

we record base rents on a straight line basis  which means that the monthly base rent income according to the terms of our leases with tenants is adjusted so that an average monthly rent is recorded for each tenant over the term of its lease 
the difference between base rent and straight line rent is a non cash increase or decrease to rental income 
the straight line rent adjustment increased revenue by approximately million in  million in and million in the significant increases in and were due to property acquisitions 
amortization of above and below market lease intangibles decreased revenue by million in  million in and million in  respectively  as described below under intangible assets 
percentage rents represent rental income that the tenant pays based on a percentage of its sales 
tenants that pay percentage rent usually pay in one of two ways  either a percentage of their total sales or a percentage of sales over a certain threshold 
in the latter case  we do not record percentage rent until the sales threshold has been reached 
revenues for rents received from tenants prior to their due dates are deferred until the period to which the rents apply 
in addition to base rents  certain lease agreements contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse a pro rata share of real estate taxes and certain common area maintenance costs 
expense reimbursement payments generally are made monthly based on a budgeted amount determined at the beginning of the year 
during the year  our income increases or decreases based on actual expense levels and changes in other factors that influence the reimbursement amounts  such as occupancy levels 
as of december  and  we accrued income of million and million  respectively  because reimbursable expense levels were greater than amounts billed 
shortly after the end of the year  we prepare a reconciliation of the actual amounts due from tenants 
the difference between the actual amount due and the amounts paid by the tenant throughout the year is billed or credited to the tenant  depending on whether the tenant paid too little or too much during the year 
lease termination fee income is recognized in the period when a termination agreement is signed and we are no longer obligated to provide space to the tenant 
in the event that a tenant is in bankruptcy when the termination agreement is signed  termination fee income is deferred and recognized when it is received 
our other source of revenue comes from the provision of management services to third parties  including property management  brokerage  leasing and development 
management fees generally are a percentage of managed property revenues or cash receipts 
leasing fees are earned upon the consummation of new leases 
development fees are earned over the time period of the development activity 
these activities collectively are referred to as management company revenue in the consolidated statement of income 
real estate land  buildings and fixtures and tenant improvements are recorded at cost and stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
renovations and or replacements  which improve or extend the life of the asset  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 

back to contents properties are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated useful lives are as follows buildings years land improvements years furniture fixtures years tenant improvements lease term we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful life of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties based on various factors  including industry standards  historical experience and the condition of the asset at the time of acquisition 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income 
if we were to determine that a longer expected useful life was appropriate for a particular asset  it would be depreciated over more years  and  other things being equal  result in less annual depreciation expense and higher annual net income 
assessment of certain other lease related costs must be made when we have a reason to believe that the tenant may not be able to perform under the terms of the lease as originally expected 
this requires us to make estimates as to the recoverability of such assets 
gains from sales of real estate properties and interests in partnerships generally are recognized using the full accrual method in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for real estate sales  provided that various criteria are met relating to the terms of sale and any subsequent involvement by us with the properties sold 
intangible assets we account for our property acquisitions under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas no 

pursuant to sfas no 
 the purchase price of a property is allocated to the property s assets based on our estimates of their fair value 
the determination of the fair value of intangible assets requires significant estimates by management and considers many factors  including our expectations about the underlying property and the general market conditions in which the property operates 
the judgment and subjectivity inherent in such assumptions can have a significant impact on the magnitude of the intangible assets that we record 
sfas no 
provides guidance on allocating a portion of the purchase price of a property to intangible assets 
our methodology for this allocation includes estimating an as if vacant fair value of the physical property  which is allocated to land  building and improvements 
the difference between the purchase price and the as if vacant fair value is allocated to intangible assets 
there are three categories of intangible assets to be considered i value of in place leases  ii above and below market value of in place leases and iii customer relationship value 
the value of in place leases is estimated based on the value associated with the costs avoided in originating leases comparable to the acquired in place leases  as well as the value associated with lost rental revenue during the assumed lease up period 
the value of in place leases is amortized as real estate amortization over the estimated weighted average remaining lease lives 
we generally use a weighted average life of seven years for this purpose 
above market and below market in place lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii our estimates of fair market lease rates for the comparable in place leases  based on factors including historical experience  recently executed transactions and specific property issues  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
the value of above market lease values is amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
the value of below market lease values is amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases  including any below market renewal period 

back to contents we allocate no value to customer relationship intangibles if we have pre existing business relationships with the major retailers in the acquired property because the customer relationships associated with the properties acquired provide no incremental value over our existing relationships 
the following table presents our intangible assets and liabilities  net of accumulated amortization  as of december  and as of december  in thousands of dollars intangible assets of properties for investment intangible assets of non core properties total value of in place lease intangibles    above market lease intangibles   subtotal    goodwill   total intangible assets    below market lease intangibles   as of december  intangible assets of properties for investment intangible assets of non core properties total value of in place lease intangibles    above market lease intangibles   subtotal    goodwill   total intangible assets    below market lease intangibles   includes million and million related to properties acquired in connection with the merger  million and million related to properties acquired in connection with the acquisitions from the rouse company and million and million related to other acquisitions as of december  and  respectively 
includes million and million related to properties acquired in connection with the merger  million and million related to properties acquired in connection with the acquisitions from the rouse company and million and million related to other acquisitions as of december  and  respectively 
includes million and million related to properties acquired in connection with the merger  million and million related to properties acquired in connection with the acquisitions from the rouse company and million and million related to other acquisitions as of december  and  respectively 
represents amounts recorded related to the acquisition of the non core properties in connection with the merger 
amortization expense recorded during the years ended december   and for the value of in place leases totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the amortization of above below market leases resulted in a net reduction in rental income of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 

back to contents our intangible assets will amortize in the next five years and thereafter as follows 
in thousands of dollars year ended december  in place lease intangibles above below market leases and thereafter   total  in accordance with sfas no 
see below  in place lease intangibles of properties held for sale are not amortized 
assets held for sale and discontinued operations we generally consider assets to be held for sale when the sale transaction has been approved by the appropriate level of management and there are no known material contingencies relating to the sale such that the sale is probable within one year 
the determination to classify an asset as held for sale requires significant estimates by us about the property and the expected market for the property  which are based on factors including recent sales of comparable properties  recent expressions of interest in the property  financial metrics of the property and the condition of the property 
we must also determine if it will be possible under those market conditions to sell the property for an acceptable price within one year 
when assets are identified by management as held for sale  we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the sales price  net of selling costs of such assets 
if  in our opinion  the net sales price of the assets that have been identified as held for sale is less than the net book value of the assets  a valuation allowance is established 
accordingly  the results of operations of operating properties classified as held for sale after january  the date on which we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 
are reflected as discontinued operations 
we continue to classify schuylkill mall as held for sale because we are still actively marketing the property  and we expect to sell it in properties that we have sold for which we have no significant continuing involvement also are reflected as discontinued operations 
asset impairment real estate investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the property may not be recoverable 
a property s value is considered impaired only if our estimate of the aggregate future cash flows to be generated by the property undiscounted and without interest charges are less than the carrying value of the property 
this estimate takes into consideration factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
in addition  these estimates may consider a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach when alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset are under consideration or when a range of possible values is estimated 
the determination of undiscounted cash flows requires significant estimates by us  including the expected course of action at the balance sheet date 
subsequent changes in estimated undiscounted cash flows arising from changes in the anticipated action to be taken with respect to the property could impact the determination of whether an impairment exists and whether the effects could materially impact our net income 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property 
we conduct an annual review of goodwill balances for impairment and to determine whether any adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill is required 

back to contents allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable related to tenant rents including base rents  straight line rents  expense reimbursements and other revenue or income 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  with respect to tenants in bankruptcy  we make estimates of the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims in assessing the estimated collectibility of the related receivable 
in some cases  the time required to reach an ultimate resolution of these claims can exceed one year 
these estimates have a direct impact on our net income because a higher bad debt reserve results in less net income  other things being equal 
in  we increased our reserve on straight line rentals from to because the consolidated straight line rent receivable balance increased significantly after the merger and the other and acquisitions took place  and because we determined that there was a greater risk associated with these amounts due to various property and industry factors 
liquidity and capital resources credit facility in february  we amended our unsecured credit facility the credit facility

the modification limits the monthly payments to interest plus any excess cash flow from the property after deducting management fees  leasing commissions and lender approved capital expenditures 
monthly excess cash flow will accumulate throughout the year in escrow  and an annual principal payment will be made on the last day of each year from this account 
all other terms of the loan  including the interest rate of  remained unchanged 
in november  we used borrowings under the credit facility to repay the million mortgage on wiregrass commons in dothan  alabama 
west manchester mall and martinsburg mall had served as part of the collateral pool that secures a mortgage with ge capital corporation 
in connection with the closing of the sale of the non core properties  these properties were released from the collateral pool and replaced by northeast tower center in philadelphia  pennsylvania and jacksonville mall in jacksonville  north carolina 
in june  we refinanced the mortgage note payable secured by moorestown mall  in moorestown  new jersey 
the million mortgage has a year term and bears interest at the fixed rate of per annum 
the proceeds from the borrowings secured by the mortgage were used to repay the previously existing mortgage note secured by moorestown mall and to fund a portion of the purchase price for plymouth meeting mall in plymouth meeting  pennsylvania and echelon mall in voorhees  new jersey

back to contents equity offering in august  we issued  common shares in a public offering at per share 
we received net proceeds from the offering of approximately million after deducting payment of the underwriting discount of per share and offering expenses 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds for the willow grove park acquisition  approximately million for the ikea acquisition  million to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility  and the remainder for working capital purposes 
capital resources we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements generally through our available working capital and net cash provided by operations 
we believe that our net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to allow us to make any distributions necessary to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the aggregate distributions made to common shareholders in were million 
in addition  we believe that net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to permit us to pay the million of annual dividends payable on the preferred shares issued in connection with the merger 
we also believe that the foregoing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our short term liquidity needs for the foreseeable future  including recurring capital expenditures  tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
the following are some of the risks that could impact our cash flows and require the funding of future distributions  capital expenditures  tenant improvements and or leasing commissions with sources other than operating cash flows unexpected changes in operations that could result from the integration of the properties acquired in and  increase in tenant bankruptcies reducing revenue and operating cash flows  increase in interest expenses as a result of borrowing incurred in order to finance long term capital requirements such as property and portfolio acquisitions  increase in interest rates affecting our net cost of borrowing  increase in insurance premiums and or our portion of claims  eroding market conditions in one or more of our primary geographic regions adversely affecting property operating cash flows  and disputes with tenants over common area maintenance and other charges

we expect to have capital expenditures relating to leasing and property improvements in of approximately million 
in general  when the credit markets are tight  we may encounter resistance from lenders when we seek financing or refinancing for properties or proposed acquisitions 
the following are some of the potential impediments to accessing additional funds under the credit facility constraining leverage covenants under the credit facility  increased interest rates affecting coverage ratios  and reduction in our consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda affecting coverage ratios

we believe that net income is the most directly comparable gaap measurement to net operating income 
we believe that net operating income is helpful to management and investors as a measure of operating performance because it is an indicator of the return on property investment  and provides a method of comparing property performance over time 
net operating income excludes general and administrative expenses  management company revenues  interest income  interest expense  depreciation and amortization  income from discontinued operations and gains on sales of interests in real estate 

back to contents the following table presents net operating income results for the years ended december  and the results are presented using the proportionate consolidation method a non gaap measure  which presents our share of the results of our partnership investments

back to contents funds from operations the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines funds from operations ffo  which is a non gaap measure  as income before gains losses on sales of properties and extraordinary items computed in accordance with gaap  plus real estate depreciation  plus or minus adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
ffo is a commonly used measure of operating performance and profitability in the reit industry  and we use ffo as a supplemental non gaap measure to compare our company s performance to that of our industry peers 
in addition  we use ffo as a performance measure for determining bonus amounts earned under certain of our performance based executive compensation programs 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition  or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do 
ffo does not include gains losses on real estate assets  which are included in the determination of net income in accordance with gaap 
accordingly  ffo is not a comprehensive measure of our operating cash flows 
in addition  since ffo does not include depreciation on real estate assets  ffo may not be a useful performance measure when comparing our operating performance to that of other non real estate commercial enterprises 
we compensate for these limitations by using ffo in conjunction with other gaap financial performance measures  such as net income and net cash provided by operating activities  and other non gaap financial performance measures  such as net operating income 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered to be an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of our financial performance or to be an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available for our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
we believe that net income is the most directly comparable gaap measurement to ffo 
we believe that ffo is helpful to management and investors as a measure of operating performance because it excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance  such as various non recurring events that are considered extraordinary under gaap  gains on sales of real estate and depreciation and amortization of real estate 
ffo increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in the increase was primarily due to operating results attributable to properties acquired in and

this was offset by credit facility repayments of million from the net proceeds of the sale of five non core properties 
cash flows used by financing activities were also impacted by distributions paid of million  net shares issued of million  principal installments on mortgage notes payable of million  and million to repay the wiregrass mall mortgage 

back to contents commitments at december   we had approximately million committed to complete current development and redevelopment projects 
total expected costs for projects with such commitments are million 
we expect to finance these amounts through borrowings under the credit facility or through short term construction loans

contingent liabilities in june and july  respectively  of  a former administrative employee and a former building engineer of pri pled guilty to criminal charges related to the misappropriation of funds at a property owned by independence blue cross ibc for which pri provided certain management services 
pri provided these services from january to december the former employees worked under the supervision of the director of real estate for ibc  who earlier pled guilty to criminal charges 
together with other individuals  the former pri employees and ibc s director of real estate misappropriated funds from ibc through a series of schemes 
ibc has estimated its losses at approximately million  and has alleged that pri is responsible for such losses under the terms of a management agreement 
to date  no lawsuit has been filed against pri 
we understand that ibc has recovered million under fidelity policies issued by ibc s insurance carriers 
in addition  we understand that several defendants in the criminal proceedings have forfeited assets having an estimated value of approximately million  which have been or will be liquidated by the united states justice department and applied toward restitution 
the restitution and insurance recoveries result in a significant mitigation of ibc s losses and potential claims against pri  although pri may be subject to subrogation claims from ibc s insurance carriers for all or a portion of the amounts paid by them to ibc 
we believe that pri has valid defenses to any potential claims by ibc 
pri has insurance to cover some or all of any potential payments to ibc  and has taken actions to preserve its rights with respect to such insurance 
we are unable to estimate or determine the likelihood of any loss to us in connection with these claims 
our management is aware of certain environmental matters at some of our properties  including ground water contamination  above normal radon levels  the presence of asbestos containing materials and lead based paint 
we have  in the past  performed remediation of such environmental matters  and our management is not aware of any significant remaining potential liability relating to these environmental matters 
we may be required in the future to perform testing relating to these matters 
although our management does not expect these matters to have any significant impact on our liquidity or results of operations  it can make no assurances that the amounts that have been reserved for these matters of million will be adequate to cover future environmental costs 
we have insurance coverage for environmental claims up to million per occurrence and up to million in the aggregate 
litigation in april  a partnership in which we hold a interest filed a complaint in the court of chancery of the state of delaware against the delaware department of transportation and its secretary alleging failure of the department and the secretary to take actions agreed upon in a settlement agreement necessary for development of the christiana power center phase ii project 
in october  the court decided that the department did breach the terms of the settlement agreement and remitted the matter to the superior court of the state of delaware for a determination of damages 
the delaware department of transportation appealed the chancery court s decision to the delaware supreme court  which  in april  affirmed the chancery court s decision 
we are not in a position to predict the outcome of the superior court s determination of damages or its ultimate effect on the construction of the christiana power center phase ii project 

back to contents competition and tenant credit risk competition in the retail real estate industry is very intense 
we compete with other public and private retail real estate companies  including companies that own or manage malls  power centers  lifestyle centers  strip centers  factory outlet centers  festival centers and community centers  as well as other commercial real estate developers and real estate owners 
we compete with these companies to attract customers to our properties  as well as to attract anchor and in line store tenants 
our malls and our power and strip centers face competition from similar retail centers that are near our retail properties 
we also face competition from a variety of different retail formats  including discount or value retailers  home shopping networks  mail order operators  catalogs  telemarketers and internet retailers 
this competition could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rent that we receive 
increased competition for tenants might also require us to make capital improvements to properties that we would not have otherwise planned to make 
any unbudgeted capital improvements could adversely affect our results of operations 
we are vulnerable to credit risk if retailers that lease space from us experience economic declines or are unable to continue operating in our retail properties due to bankruptcies or other factors 
we also compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of malls and other retail properties  including institutional pension funds  other reits and other owner operators of retail properties 
these competitors might drive up the price we must pay for properties  other assets or other companies we seek to acquire or might themselves succeed in acquiring those properties  assets or companies 
if we pay higher prices for properties  our investment returns will be reduced  which will adversely affect the value of our securities 
seasonality there is seasonality in the retail real estate industry 
retail property leases often provide for the payment of rents based on a percentage of sales over certain levels 
income from such rents is recorded only after the minimum sales levels have been met 
the sales levels are often met in the fourth quarter  during the december holiday season 
also  many new and temporary leases are entered into later in the year in anticipation of the holiday season and many tenants vacant their space early in the year 
as a result  our occupancy and cash flow are generally higher in the fourth quarter and lower in the first quarter  excluding the effect of ongoing redevelopment projects 
our concentration in the retail sector increases our exposure to seasonality and is expected to result in a greater percentage of our cash flows being received in the fourth quarter 
inflation inflation can have many effects on financial performance 
retail property leases often provide for the payment of rents based on a percentage of sales  which may increase with inflation 
leases may also provide for tenants to bear all or a portion of operating expenses  which may reduce the impact of such increases on us 
however  during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in a lease  rent increases may not keep up with inflation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates 
as of december   our consolidated debt portfolio consisted of million borrowed under our credit facility and  million in fixed rate mortgage notes  including million of mortgage debt premium 
changes in market interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable portions of our debt portfolio 
a change in market interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the fair value  but it has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
a change in market interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows  but does not impact the fair value 
the sensitivity analysis related to the fixed debt portfolio assumes an immediate basis point change in interest rates from their actual december  levels  with all other variables held constant 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the net financial instrument position of million at december  a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase in the net financial instrument position of million at december  based on the variable rate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates would result in an additional million in interest annually 
a basis point decrease would reduce interest incurred by million annually 
to manage interest rate risk  we may employ options  forwards  interest rate swaps  caps and floors  or a combination thereof  depending on the underlying exposure 
we undertake a variety of borrowings  from lines of credit to medium and long term financings 
to limit overall interest cost  we may use interest rate instruments  typically interest rate swaps  to convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt  or even a portion of our fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
interest rate differentials that arise under these swap contracts are recognized in interest expense over the life of the contracts 
the resulting cost of funds is expected to be lower than that which would have been available if debt with matching characteristics was issued directly 
we may also employ forwards or purchased options to hedge qualifying anticipated transactions 
gains and losses are deferred and recognized in net income in the same period that the underlying transaction occurs  expires or is otherwise terminated 
we had no outstanding hedging transactions as of december  
back to contents mortgage notes payable  which are secured by of our wholly owned properties  are due in installments over various terms extending to the year  with interest at rates ranging from to and a weighted average interest rate of at december  mortgage notes payable for properties classified as discontinued operations are accounted for in liabilities of assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts of the expected annual maturities and the weighted average interest rates for the principal payments in the specified period in thousands of dollars fixed rate debt variable rate debt year ended december  principal payments weighted average interest rate principal payments weighted average interest rate and thereafter  the credit facility has a term that expires in november  with an additional month extension provided that there is no event of default at that time 
the preceding table excludes scheduled maturities for properties that are classified as held for sale 
there is one held for sale property that has a mortgage with an outstanding balance of million and an interest rate of at december  because the information presented above includes only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
the information presented herein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  the hedging strategies that we might employ at the time  and interest rates
