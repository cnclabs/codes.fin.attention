item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview while commodity prices remain volatile on a short term basis depending upon supply and demand  the company s investment decisions are based on long term outlooks 
the corporate plan is a fundamental annual management process that is the basis for setting near term operating and capital objectives in addition to providing the longer term economic assumptions used for investment evaluation purposes 
annual plan volumes are based on individual field production profiles updated annually 
prices for natural gas and other products used for investment evaluation purposes are based on corporate plan assumptions that are developed annually 
potential investment opportunities are tested over a wide range of economic scenarios to establish the resiliency of each opportunity 
once investments are made  a reappraisal process is completed 
business environment and outlook natural resources the company produces crude oil and natural gas for sale into large north american markets 
economic and population growth are expected to remain the primary drivers of energy demand 
the company expects the global economy to grow at an average rate of about three percent per year through world energy demand should grow by about two percent per year  and oil and gas are expected to account for about percent of world energy supply by over the same period  the canadian economy is expected to grow at an average rate of two percent per year  and canadian demand for energy at a rate of about one percent per year 
oil and gas are expected to continue to supply two thirds of canadian energy demand 
it is expected that canada will also be a growing supplier of energy to us markets through this period 
oil products are the transportation fuel of choice for the world s fleet of cars  trucks  trains  ships and airplanes 
primarily because of increased demand in developing countries  oil production is expected to increase by percent or nearly million barrels per day over the next three decades 
canada s oil sands represent an important additional source of supply 
natural gas is expected to be the fastest growing primary energy source globally  capturing about one third of all incremental energy growth and approaching one quarter of global energy supplies 
natural gas production from mature established regions in the united states and canada is not expected to meet increasing demand  strengthening the market opportunities for new gas supply from canada s frontier areas 
crude oil and natural gas prices are determined by global and north america markets and are subject to changing supply and demand conditions 
these can be influenced by a wide range of factors including economic conditions  international political developments and weather 
in the past  crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and the company expects that volatility to continue 
the company has a large and diverse portfolio of oil and gas resources  both developed and undeveloped  in canada  which helps reduce the risks of dependence on potentially limited supply sources in the upstream 
with the relative maturity of conventional production in the established producing areas of western canada  the company s production is expected to come increasingly from frontier and unconventional sources  particularly oil sands and natural gas from the far north  where the company has large undeveloped resource opportunities 

table of contents petroleum products the downstream continues to experience ongoing volatility in industry margins 
refining margins are the difference between what a refinery pays for its raw materials primarily crude oil and the wholesale market prices for the range of products produced primarily gasoline  diesel fuel  heating oil  jet fuel and fuel oil 
crude oil and many products are widely traded with published international prices 
prices for those commodities are determined by the marketplace  often an international marketplace  and are impacted by many factors  including global and regional supply demand balances  inventory levels  refinery operations  import export balances  seasonality and weather 
canadian wholesale prices in particular are largely determined by wholesale prices in adjacent us regions 
these prices and factors are continually monitored and provide input to operating decisions about which raw materials to buy  facilities to operate and products to make 
however  there are no reliable indicators of future market factors that accurately predict changes in margins from period to period 
the company s downstream strategies are to provide customers with quality service at the lowest total cost offer  have the lowest unit costs amongst the company s competitors  ensure efficient and effective use of capital and capitalize on integration with the company s other businesses 
the company owns and operates four refineries in canada with distillation capacity of  barrels a day and lubricant manufacturing capacity of  barrels a day 
the company s fuels marketing business includes retail operations across canada serving customers through about  esso branded service stations  of which about are company owned or leased  and wholesale and industrial operations through a network of distribution terminals 
chemicals although the current business environment is favourable  the north american petrochemical industry is cyclical 
the company s strategy for its chemicals business is to reduce costs and maximize value by continuing to increase the integration of its chemicals plants at sarnia and dartmouth with the refineries 
the company also benefits from its integration within exxonmobil s north american chemicals businesses  enabling the company to maintain a leadership position in its key market segments 
results of operations net income in was  million or a share the best year on record compared with  million or a share in  million or a share 
higher realizations for crude oil  stronger industry refining and petrochemical margins  and higher volumes of syncrude production  natural gas and petroleum products contributed positively to net income  partly offset by lower marketing margins 
compared with  these favourable operating results were partly offset by the combined negative effects of a higher canadian dollar on resource and product prices of about million  the absence of favourable foreign exchange effects on the company s us dollar denominated debt of about million  and lower benefits from tax matters of about million 
total revenues were billion  up about percent from natural resources net income from natural resources was a record  million  up from  million in  million 
the positive earnings effects of improved realizations for crude oil and natural gas  combined with higher syncrude  natural gas and natural gas liquids ngls volumes were partly offset by lower cold lake bitumen production  lower benefits from tax matters and the negative effects of a higher canadian dollar 
resource revenues were billion  up from billion in billion 
the main reasons for the increase were higher prices for crude oil and increased natural gas and syncrude volumes 
financial statistics millions net income revenues us dollar world oil prices were considerably higher in than in the previous year 
the annual average price of brent crude oil  the most actively traded north sea crude and a common benchmark of world oil markets  was us a barrel in  a more than percent increase over the average price of in 
however  increases in the company s canadian dollar realizations for conventional crude oil and cold lake bitumen were dampened by the effects of a higher canadian dollar 
average realizations for conventional crude oil during the year were cdn a barrel  an increase of percent from that of in 

table of contents average prices for canadian heavy crude oil were higher in  but by less than the relative increase in light crude oil prices  as increased supply of heavy crude oil widened the average spread between light and heavy crude 
the price of bow river  a benchmark canadian heavy crude oil  increased by percent in  much less than the increase in prices for canadian light crude oil 
cold lake bitumen realizations in us dollars averaged percent higher in than in average realizations for cold lake bitumen were only about percent higher than the previous year  reflecting the effect of the higher canadian dollar

gross production of ngls available for sale averaged  barrels a day in  up from  barrels in 
gross production of natural gas increased to million cubic feet a day from million in million

sales of chemicals were  tonnes a day  unchanged from  tonnes  while polyethylene and benzene sales were up three percent and percent respectively over operating costs in the chemicals segment for were about the same as higher energy costs were offset by lower depreciation expense 
a significant portion of the property  plant and equipment currently used in production and manufacturing  has been fully depreciated 
corporate and other net income from corporate and other accounts was negative million in  compared with positive million in negative million 
lower net income in was mainly due to the absence of the favourable foreign exchange effects on the company s us dollar denominated debt  which was replaced with canadian dollar denominated debt in june and july of net income for also included a nonrecurring after tax write down of million on a north toronto property  which was acquired in to be the company s future toronto headquarters site 
the remeasurement at fair value of this property reflected a change in its intended use and management s commitment to sell following the announcement of the relocation of the company s headquarters to calgary 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash millions of dollars cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at end of year although the company issues long term debt from time to time  internally generated funds cover the majority of its financial requirements 
the management of cash that may be temporarily available as surplus to the company s immediate needs is carefully controlled  both to ensure that it is secure and readily available to meet the company s cash requirements as they arise and to optimize returns on cash balances 
cash flows from operating activities are highly dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices and product margins 
in addition  the company will need to continually find and develop new resources  and continue to develop and apply new technologies and recovery processes to existing fields  in order to maintain or increase production and resulting cash flows in future periods 
projects are in place  or underway  to increase production capacity 
however  these volume increases are subject to a variety of risks including project execution  operational outages  reservoir performance and regulatory changes 
the company s financial strength enables it to make large  long term capital expenditures 
the company s large and diverse portfolio of development opportunities and the complementary nature of its business segments help mitigate the overall risks of the company and associated cash flow 
further  due to its financial strength  debt capacity and diverse portfolio of opportunities  the risk associated with failure or delay of any single project would not have a significant impact on the company s liquidity or ability to generate sufficient cash flows for operations and its fixed commitments 
cash flow from operating activities cash provided by operating activities was  million  up from  million in  million 
the increased cash inflow was mainly due to higher net income  timing of scheduled income tax payments and the additional funding contributions to the employee pension plan in 
table of contents capital and exploration expenditures total capital and exploration expenditures were  million in  down slightly from  million in  million 
the funds were used mainly to invest in growth opportunities in the oil sands and the mackenzie gas project  to upgrade refineries to meet low sulphur diesel requirements and to enhance the company s retail network 
about million was spent on projects related to reducing the environmental impact of its operations and improving safety including about million on the million capital project to produce low sulphur diesel 
the following table shows the company s capital and exploration expenditures for natural resources during the five years ending december  millions exploration production heavy oil total for the natural resources segment  about percent of the capital and exploration expenditures in was focused on growth opportunities 
the single largest investment during the year was the company s share of the syncrude expansion 
construction on the upgrader expansion made good progress since the first quarter of when cost estimates were substantially increased and the construction schedule was extended 
at year end  the project was tracking to the revised cost and construction schedule 
the remainder of investment was directed to advancing the mackenzie gas project and drilling at cold lake and in conventional fields in eastern and western canada 
for the mackenzie gas project  in october  the main regulatory applications and environmental impact statement were filed with the national energy board and other boards  panels and agencies responsible for assessing and regulating energy developments in the northwest territories 
the regulatory review process is expected to take up to months 
a decision to proceed with the project will be made by the co venturers of the project after approvals are received and any conditions attached to the approvals are assessed 
planned capital and exploration expenditures in natural resources are expected to be about billion in  with nearly percent of the total focused on growth opportunities 
much of the expenditure will be directed to the expansion now underway at syncrude 
investments are also planned for the ongoing development drilling at cold lake  the mackenzie gas project and further development drilling in western canada

sfas r  share based payments 
sfas r requires compensation costs related to share based payment arrangements to employees to be recognized in the income statement over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
the amount of the compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the instruments issued 
in addition  liability awards will be remeasured each reporting period through settlement 
sfas r is effective as of july  for all awards granted or modified after that date and for those awards granted prior to that date for which the requisite employee service has not yet been rendered 
sfas r will have no impact on the company because in the company adopted a policy of expensing all share based payments that is consistent with the provisions of sfas r and the requisite employee service for all prior year outstanding stock options has been rendered 
emerging accounting and reporting issues accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty at its november meeting  the emerging issues task force eitf of fasb began discussion of issue  accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty 
this issue addresses the question of when it is appropriate to measure purchases and sales of inventory at fair value and record them in cost of sales and revenues and when they should be recorded as an exchange measured at the book value of the item sold 
the eitf did not reach a consensus on this issue  but requested the fasb staff to further explore the alternative views 
the company records certain purchases and sales entered into contemporaneously with the same counterparty as cost of sales and revenues  measured at fair value as agreed upon by a willing buyer and a willing seller 
these transactions occur under contractual arrangements that establish the agreement terms either jointly  in a single contract  or separately  in individual contracts 
should the eitf reach a consensus on this issue  requiring these transactions to be recorded as exchanges measured at book value  the reported amounts in operating revenues and purchases of crude oil and products on the consolidated statement of income would be lower by equal amounts with no impact on net income 
the company has not yet determined the amount by which operating revenues and purchases of crude oil and products would be lower under this interpretation 
a special effort is needed to identify purchase sale transactions from other monetary purchases and monetary sales 
a best effort estimate based on this undertaking is expected to be available in the second quarter of the company will disclose this information  if material  once it is available 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap and include estimates that reflect management s best judgments 
the company s accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its straightforward business model 
the company does not use financing structures for the purpose of altering accounting outcomes or removing debt from the balance sheet 
the following summary provides further information about the critical accounting policies and the estimates that are made by the company to apply those policies 
it should be read in conjunction with pages f to f 
table of contents hydrocarbon reserves proved oil  gas and synthetic crude oil reserve quantities are used as the basis of calculating unit of production rates for depreciation and evaluating for impairment 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs and deposits under existing economic and operating conditions 
estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are based on detailed geological and engineering assessments of in place crude bitumen volume  the mining plan  historical extraction recovery and upgrading yield factors  installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits 
the estimation of proved reserves is controlled by the company through long standing approval guidelines 
reserve changes are made with a well established  disciplined process driven by senior level geoscience and engineering professionals assisted by a central reserves group with significant independent technical experience culminating in reviews with and approval by senior management and the company s board of directors 
key features of the estimation include rigorous peer reviewed technical evaluations and analysis of well and field performance information  and a requirement that management make a commitment toward the development of the reserves prior to booking 
notably  technical and other professionals involved in the process are not compensated based on the levels of proved reserves bookings 
although the company is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced  the timing and ultimate recovery can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects  reservoir performance and significant changes in long term oil and gas price levels 
in compliance with the united states securities and exchange commission regulatory guidance  the company has reported reserves on the basis of the day of december   prices and costs year end prices 
resultant changes in cold lake bitumen and the associated natural gas reserves from the year end estimates  which were based on long term projections of oil and gas prices consistent with those used in the company s investment decision making process  are shown in the line titled year end price cost revisions on page the requirement to use year end prices for reserves estimation introduces single day price focus and volatility in the valuation of reserves to be produced over the next to years 
the company believes that this approach is inconsistent with the long term nature of the natural resources business 
the use of prices from a single date is not relevant to the investment decisions made by the company and annual variations in reserves based on such year end prices are not of consequence in how the business is managed 
the impact of year end prices on reserve estimation is most clearly shown at cold lake where proved bitumen and associated natural gas reserves were reduced by about million oil equivalent barrels as a result of using december  prices  which were unusually low 
prices of cold lake bitumen were strong for most of  however  they began to deteriorate in the middle of the fourth quarter and ended on december   percent below the year s average 
prices quickly rebounded from december  and through january returned to levels that have restored the reserves to the proved category 
performance related revisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or revaluation of already available geologic  reservoir or production data  or new geologic or reservoir data 
performance related revisions can also include changes associated with the performance of improved recovery projects and significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment facility capacity 
the company uses the successful efforts method to account for its exploration and production activities 
under this method  costs are accumulated on a field by field basis with certain exploratory expenditures and exploratory dry holes being expensed as incurred 
the company continues to carry as an asset the cost of drilling exploratory wells that find sufficient quantities of reserves to justify their completion as producing wells if the required capital expenditure is made and drilling of additional exploratory wells is underway or firmly planned for the near future 
once exploration activities demonstrate that sufficient quantities of commercially producible reserves have been discovered  continued capitalization is dependent on project reviews  which take place at least annually  to ensure that satisfactory progress toward ultimate development of the reserves is being achieved 
exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense 
capitalized exploratory drilling costs pending the determination of proved reserves or the amount of suspended exploratory well costs were negligible  million and million at december   and respectively 
costs of productive wells and development dry holes are capitalized and amortized on the unit of production method for each field 
the company uses this accounting policy instead of the full cost method because it provides a more timely accounting of the success or failure of the company s exploration and production activities 
impact of reserves on depreciation the calculation of unit of production depreciation is a critical accounting estimate that measures the depreciation of natural resources assets 
it is the ratio of actual volumes produced to total proved developed reserves those reserves recoverable through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods applied to the asset cost 
the volumes produced and asset cost are known and while proved developed reserves have a high probability of recoverability  they are based on estimates that are subject to some variability 
this variability has generally resulted in net upward revisions of proved reserves in existing fields  as more information becomes available through research and production 
revisions have averaged million oil equivalent barrels per year over the last five years and have resulted from effective reservoir 
table of contents management and the application of new technology 
while the upward revisions the company has made over the last five years are an indicator of variability  they have had little impact on the unit of production rates of depreciation because they have been small compared to the large proved reserves base 
impact of reserves and prices on testing for impairment proved oil and gas properties held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
the company estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts 
in general  impairment analyses are based on proved reserves 
where probable reserves exist  an appropriately risk adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the impairment evaluation 
an asset would be impaired if the undiscounted cash flows were less than its carrying value 
impairments are measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value 
the impairment evaluation triggers include a significant decrease in current and projected prices or reserve volumes  an accumulation of project costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected  and historical and current negative operating losses 
in general  the company does not view temporarily low oil prices as a triggering event for conducting the impairment tests 
the markets for crude oil and natural gas have a history of significant price volatility 
although prices will occasionally drop precipitously  the relative growth decline in supply versus demand will determine industry prices over the long term and these cannot be accurately predicted 
accordingly  any impairment tests that the company performs make use of the company s long term price assumptions for the crude oil and natural gas markets  petroleum products and chemicals 
these are the same price assumptions that are used in the company s annual planning and budgeting processes and are also used for capital investment decisions 
the standardized measure of discounted future cash flows on page is based on the year end price applied for all future years  as required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
future prices used for any impairment tests will vary from the one used in the sfas disclosure  and could be lower or higher for any given year 
retirement benefits the company s pension plan is managed in compliance with the requirements of governmental authorities and meets funding levels as determined by independent third party actuaries 
pension accounting requires explicit assumptions regarding  among others  the discount rate for the benefit obligations  the expected rate of return on plan assets and the long term rate of future compensation increases 
all pension assumptions are reviewed annually by senior management 
these assumptions are adjusted only as appropriate to reflect long term changes in market rates and outlook 
the long term expected rate of return on plan assets of percent used in compares to actual returns of percent and percent achieved over the last and year periods ending december  if different assumptions are used  the expense and obligations could increase or decrease as a result 
the company s potential exposure to changes in assumptions is summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements on page f at the company  differences between actual returns on plan assets versus long term expected returns are not recorded in the year the differences occur  but rather are amortized in pension expense as permitted by gaap  along with other actuarial gains and losses over the expected remaining service life of employees 
the company uses the fair value of the plan assets at year end to determine the amount of the actual gain or loss that will be amortized and does not use a moving average value of plan assets 
pension expense represented about one percent of total expenses in asset retirement obligations and other environmental liabilities legal obligations associated with site restoration on the retirement of assets with determinable useful lives are recognized when they are incurred  which is typically at the time the assets are installed 
the obligations are initially measured at fair value and discounted to present value 
over time  the discounted asset retirement obligation amount will be accreted for the change in its present value  with this effect included in operating expense 
as payments to settle the obligations occur on an ongoing basis and will continue over the lives of the operating assets  which can exceed years  the discount rate will be adjusted only as appropriate to reflect long term changes in market rates and outlook 
for  the obligations were discounted at six percent and the accretion expense was million  which was significantly less than one percent of total expenses in the year 
there would be no material impact on the company s reported financial results if a different discount rate had been used 
asset retirement obligations are not recognized for assets with an indeterminate useful life 
for these and non operating assets  the company accrues provisions for environmental liabilities when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 

table of contents asset retirement obligations and other environmental liabilities are based on engineering estimated costs  taking into account the anticipated method and extent of remediation consistent with legal requirements  current technology and the possible use of the location 
since these estimates are specific to the locations involved  there are many individual assumptions underlying the company s total asset retirement obligations and provision for other environmental liabilities 
while these individual assumptions can be subject to change  none of them is individually significant to the company s reported financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of financial  operating and market risks in the course of its business 
some of these risks are within the company s control  while others are not 
for those risks that can be controlled  specific risk management strategies are employed to reduce the likelihood of loss 
other risks  such as changes in international commodity prices and currency exchange rates  are beyond the company s control 
although the government of canada in ratifying the kyoto protocol agreed to restrictions of greenhouse gas emissions by the period  it has not determined what measures it will impose on companies 
consequently  attempts to assess any impact on the company can only be speculative 
the company will continue to monitor the development of legal requirements in this area 
the company s size  strong financial position and the complementary nature of its natural resources  petroleum products and chemicals segments help mitigate the company s exposure to changes in these other risks 
the company s potential exposure to these types of risk is summarized in the table below

millions of dollars after tax four dollars us a barrel change in crude oil prices sixty cents a thousand cubic feet change in natural gas prices one cent a litre change in sales margins for total petroleum products one cents us a pound change in sales margins for polyethylene one quarter percent decrease increase in short term interest rates eight cents decrease increase in the value of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar the amount quoted to illustrate the impact of each sensitivity represents a change of about percent in the value of the commodity or rate in question at the end of each sensitivity calculation shows the impact on net income that results from a change in one factor  after tax and royalties and holding all other factors constant
