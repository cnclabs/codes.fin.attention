item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial review the principal objective of this financial review is to provide an overview of the financial condition and results of operations of provident bankshares corporation and its subsidiaries for the three years ended december  this discussion and tabular presentations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes as well as the other information herein  particularly the information regarding the corporation s business operations as described in item critical accounting policies and estimates discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements of the corporation  which are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates estimates on an on going basis  including those related to the allowance for loan losses  non accrual loans  asset prepayment rates  other real estate owned  other than temporary impairment of investment securities  goodwill and intangible assets  pension and post retirement benefits  stock based compensation  derivative positions  recourse liabilities  litigation and income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for loan losses  other than temporary impairment of investment securities  goodwill and intangible assets  asset prepayment rates and income taxes 
each estimate is discussed below 
the financial impact of each estimate  to the extent significant to financial results  is discussed in the applicable sections of management s discussion and analysis 
it is at least reasonably possible that each of the corporation s estimates could change in the near term and the effect of the change could be material to the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses the corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses the allowance  which is intended to be management s best estimate of probable inherent losses in the outstanding loan portfolio 
the allowance is reduced by actual credit losses and is increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries of previous losses 
the provisions for loan losses are charges to earnings to bring the total allowance to a level considered necessary by management 
the allowance is based on management s continuing review and evaluation of the loan portfolio 
this process provides an allowance consisting of two components  allocated and unallocated 
to arrive at the allocated component of the allowance  the corporation combines estimates of the allowances needed for loans analyzed individually and on a pooled basis 
the allocated component of the allowance is supplemented by an unallocated component 
the portion of the allowance that is allocated to individual internally criticized and non accrual loans is determined by estimating the inherent loss on each problem credit after giving consideration to the value of underlying collateral 
management emphasizes loan quality and close monitoring of potential problem credits 
credit risk identification and review processes are utilized in order to assess and monitor the degree of risk in the loan portfolio 
the corporation s lending and credit administration staff are charged with reviewing the loan portfolio and identifying changes in the economy or in a borrower s circumstances which may affect the ability to repay debt or the value of pledged collateral 
a loan classification and review system exists that identifies those loans with a higher than normal risk of uncollectibility 
each commercial loan is assigned a grade based upon an assessment of the borrower s financial capacity to service the debt and the presence and value of collateral for the loan 
for portfolios such as consumer loans  commercial business loans and loans secured by real estate  the determination of the allocated allowance is conducted at an aggregate  or pooled  level 
each quarter  historical rolling loss rates for homogenous pools of loans in these portfolios provide the basis for the allocated reserve 
for any portfolio where the bank lacks sufficient historic experience  industry loss rates are used 
if recent history is not deemed to reflect the inherent losses existing within a portfolio  older historic loss rates during a period of similar economic or market conditions are used 
the bank s credit administration group adjusts the indicated loss rates based on qualitative factors 
factors that are considered in adjusting loss rates include risk characteristics  credit concentration trends and general economic conditions  including job growth and unemployment rates 
for commercial and real estate portfolios  additional factors include the level and trend of watched and 
table of contents criticized credits within those portfolios  commercial real estate vacancy  absorption and rental rates  and the number and volume of syndicated credits  construction loans  or other portfolio segments deemed to carry higher levels of risk 
upon completion of the qualitative adjustments  the overall allowance is allocated to the components of the portfolio based on the adjusted loss factors 
the unallocated component of the allowance exists to mitigate the imprecision inherent in management s estimates of expected credit losses and includes its judgmental determination of the amounts necessary for concentrations  economic uncertainties and other subjective factors that may not have been fully considered in the allocated allowance 
the relationship of the unallocated component to the total allowance may fluctuate from period to period 
although management has allocated the majority of the allowance to specific loan categories  the evaluation of the allowance is considered in its entirety 
lending management meets at least quarterly with executive management to review the credit quality of the loan portfolios and to evaluate the allowance 
the corporation has an internal risk analysis and review staff that continuously reviews loan quality and reports the results of its reviews to executive management and the board of directors 
such reviews also assist management in establishing the level of the allowance 
management believes that it uses the best information available to make determinations about the allowance and that it has established its existing allowance in accordance with gaap 
if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making determinations  adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and results of operations could be affected 
because events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that increases to the allowance will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
the bank is examined periodically by the fdic and  accordingly  as part of this exam  the allowance is reviewed for adequacy utilizing specific guidelines 
based upon their review  the regulators may from time to time require reserves in addition to those previously provided 
other than temporary impairment of investment securities securities are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary 
management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline  in addition to the reasons underlying the decline  to determine whether the loss in value is other than temporary 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent 
it indicates that the prospects for a near term recovery of value are not necessarily favorable  or that there is a lack of evidence to support fair values equal to  or greater than  the carrying value of the investment 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized 
goodwill and intangible assets for purchase acquisitions  the corporation records the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and liabilities assumed at their fair value  which in many instances involves estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  or valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques 
the determination of the useful lives of intangible assets is subjective  as is the appropriate amortization period for such intangible assets 
these estimates also include the establishment of various accruals and allowances based on planned facilities dispositions and employee severance considerations  among other acquisition related items 
in addition  purchase acquisitions typically result in goodwill  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired by the corporation 
the corporation tests goodwill annually for impairment 
such tests involve the use of estimates and assumptions 
intangible assets other than goodwill  such as deposit based intangibles  which are determined to have finite lives are amortized over their estimated remaining useful lives which range from to years 
income taxes the corporation accounts for income taxes under the asset liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
a valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when in the judgment of management  it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not become realizable 
it is at least reasonably possible that management s judgment about the need for a valuation allowance for deferred taxes could change in the near term 
financial condition total assets were billion at december   an increase of billion from december  the ongoing transformation of the balance sheet has resulted in a higher percentage of loans and deposits that have been originated by the 
table of contents bank s core business lines 
the merger with southern financial on april  added million in loan balances and billion in deposit balances 
the corporation acquired southern financial on april   using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the results of operations of southern financial are not included in the year ended includes the results of operations of southern financial for the eight months subsequent to the acquisition 
earning assets total average earning asset balances increased to billion in  an increase of million  or  from the following table summarizes the composition of the bank s average earning assets for the periods indicated

the average loan growth of million is comprised of million  or  in consumer loans and million  or in commercial loans 
the result is a balanced mix of revenue sources between the two product segments with billion  or  in consumer loans  and billion  or in commercial loans 
the growth of million in average commercial loans was split between commercial real estate including construction and mortgage loans  which grew million  and commercial business loans  which grew million 
while commercial loans acquired with the southern financial merger contributed to the increase  organic loan production from existing provident units continued to grow at a double digit pace 
the growth in average consumer loans was driven by strong production of home equity loans and lines 
production of direct consumer loans  primarily home equity loans and lines generated by the bank s retail banking offices  phone center and internet unit  totaled million in  a increase from production 
the strong production in the current year resulted in a million  or  net increase in average home equity loan and line balances to million 
average consumer loan balances from the washington market grew in  reflecting the bank s continued expansion into that market 
average marine loans  which are originated indirectly through brokers but underwritten individually by the bank  had modest growth and represented of average consumer loans in the corporation s portfolio of acquired residential mortgage loans consisting of first mortgages  home equity loans and lines represented of average total loans in  compared to in over the past several years  the bank has increased its credit quality requirements for new acquisitions and shifted its lien position focus from predominantly second lien position to entirely first lien position 
in  the corporation purchased million in loans secured by residential real estate  all of which were in first lien position  including million in loans to borrowers residing in the bank s footprint 
provident will service the 
table of contents loans within its footprint in order to cultivate additional relationships with the borrowers 
at december   approximately of the acquired portfolio was in first lien position 
management intends to continue to purchase residential loans to maintain an average acquired portfolio size of approximately million 
average balances in the originated residential mortgage portfolio continued to decline during  to million  since the bank does not retain new residential loan originations 
the growth in the investment portfolio average balances of million in was primarily as a result of the merger with southern financial 
although over million of investments were acquired in the merger  provident reduced its portfolio by approximately million in the second quarter to achieve a more profitable asset mix 
asset quality the following table presents information with respect to non performing assets and day delinquencies for the years indicated 
asset quality summary december  dollars in thousands non performing assets originated residential mortgage consumer commercial mortgage residential real estate construction commercial real estate construction commercial business total non accrual loans commercial business total renegotiated loans non real estate assets land residential real estate total other assets and real estate owned total non performing assets day delinquencies consumer commercial business residential real estate mortgage commercial real estate mortgage total day delinquencies asset quality ratios non performing loans to loans non performing assets to loans consumer non accrual loans are comprised entirely of credits secured by residential property and other secured loans  primarily purchased loans 
consumer loans secured by nonresidential property and unsecured consumer loans are not placed in non accrual status but are charged off at and days  respectively 
the asset quality within the corporation s loan portfolios remained strong in non performing assets were million at december   up million from the level at december  the level of non performing assets was elevated by the addition of non performing commercial business and commercial real estate construction loans acquired in the merger 
the level of non performing assets at december  is consistent with historical trends of the two companies on a combined basis 
of the total non performing assets  million are in the consumer and residential mortgage loan portfolios  which are collateralized by to family residences 
non performing commercial business loans include million of loans that have us government guarantees 
with the vast majority of non performing loans already written down to net fair value  management expects little further loss on those loans 
during  the corporation sold approximately million of its non performing acquired residential loan portfolio 

table of contents the overall asset quality ratios of the corporation  including the impact of the southern financial portfolio  remain consistent with pre merger levels 
at december   non performing assets as a percentage of loans outstanding were compared to at december  although no assurances can be given  management believes that non performing assets will remain relatively stable in the near term 
total day delinquencies increased million in  however  total delinquencies as a percentage of total loans outstanding were in compared to in presented below is interest income that would have been recorded on all non accrual loans if such loans had been paid in accordance with their original terms and the interest income on such loans that was actually received and recorded for the year

table of contents the following table reflects the allocation of the allowance at december to the various loan categories 
the entire allowance is available to absorb losses from any type of loan 
allocation of allowance for loan losses in thousands consumer commercial real estate mortgage residential real estate construction commercial real estate construction commercial business unallocated total allowance for loan losses as a result of the acquisition of southern financial  the corporation recorded an additional allowance of million  or approximately of the loans acquired 
net charge offs exceeded the provision for loan losses by million  as the application of provident collection and credit standards resulted in higher net charge offs in the commercial portfolio 
the allowance as a percentage of loans outstanding increased from at december  to at december  the allowance coverage remained fairly consistent  with coverage of of non performing loans at december   compared to at december  portfolio wide net charge offs represented of average loans in  down from in for consumer portfolios that experienced losses  the twelve month rolling loss rates in each of the portfolios continued to be at their lowest levels in several years 
management believes that the allowance at december  represents its best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio and that it uses the best information available to make such determinations 
if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making determinations  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and results of operations could be affected 
based on information currently available to the corporation  management believes it has established its existing allowance in accordance with gaap 
because events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that increases to the allowance will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
sources of funds the following table summarizes the composition of the corporation s average deposit and borrowing balances for the periods indicated 
average deposits and borrowings year ended december  dollars in thousands variance variance noninterest bearing interest bearing demand money market savings direct time deposits brokered time deposits total deposits borrowings fed funds fhlb borrowings repos and other trust preferred securities total borrowings total average deposits and borrowings 
table of contents average deposits increased million  or  in similar to the loan businesses  the growth was evenly balanced between deposits from consumers  which grew million  or  and deposits from businesses  which grew million  or 
brokered deposits remained fairly constant 
average borrowings increased million in average fed funds increased million  reflecting management s intentions to match fund more of the bank s prime based loan portfolio with these borrowings 
average fhlb borrowings increased million  offsetting run off of higher cost pre merger brokered cds 
in  the bank restructured million of fhlb borrowings 
debt that was either short term or floating rate of million was restructured in the second quarter  with no loss  in conjunction with the southern financial merger 
debt that was either fixed rate or cms based of million  with an average rate of  was extinguished in the third and fourth quarters 
losses of million were incurred in connection with this restructuring  which is shown in net gains losses in the consolidated statements of income 
the borrowings were replaced with short term or floating rate borrowings at market rates of approximately 
average repo balances increased million  representing commercial cash management products 
average trust preferred balances increased million  due to million of floating rate trust preferred securities issued in december in contemplation of the merger  combined with million of trust preferred securities acquired as part of the merger 
liquidity an important component of the bank s asset liability structure is the level of liquidity available to meet the needs of customers and creditors 
traditional sources of bank liquidity include deposit growth  loan repayments  investment maturities  asset sales  borrowings and interest received 
management believes the bank has sufficient liquidity to meet funding needs in the foreseeable future 
the bank s primary source of liquidity beyond the traditional sources is the assets it possesses  which can either be pledged as collateral for secured borrowings or sold outright 
the bank s primary sources for raising secured borrowings are the fhlb and securities broker dealers 
at december   billion of secured borrowings were employed  with sufficient collateral available to immediately raise an additional million 
an excess liquidity position of million remains after covering million of unsecured funds that mature in the next three months 
in january  the corporation added million of secured borrowing facilities to enhance its sources of liquidity 
additionally  over million of assets are maintained as collateral with the federal reserve that is available as a contingent funding source 
the bank also has several unsecured funding sources available should the need arise 
at december   the bank possessed over million of overnight borrowing capacity  of which only million was in use at year end 
the brokered cd and unsecured debt markets  which generally are more expensive than secured funds of similar maturity  are also viable funding alternatives 
in  the bank issued million of brokered cds at favorable pricing levels 
as an alternative to raising secured funds  the bank can raise liquidity through asset sales 
at december   over million of the bank s investment portfolio was immediately saleable at a market value equaling or exceeding its amortized cost basis 
in  the corporation transferred million of securities from securities available for sale to securities held to maturity  in order to reduce the potential impact of rising interest rates on other comprehensive income 
additionally  over a day time frame  a majority of the bank s billion consumer loan portfolio is saleable in an efficient market 
provident trust ii  a million dividend security  is redeemable after march  on february   the corporation announced the redemption of this issue on march  a significant use of the corporation s liquidity is the dividends it pays to shareholders 
the corporation is a one bank holding company that relies upon the bank s performance to generate capital growth through bank earnings 
a portion of the bank s earnings is passed to the corporation in the form of cash dividends 
as a commercial bank under the maryland financial institution law  the bank may declare cash dividends from undivided profits or  with the prior approval of the commissioner of financial regulation  out of paid in capital in excess of of its required capital stock  and after providing for due or accrued expenses  losses  interest and taxes 
these dividends paid to the holding company are utilized to pay dividends to stockholders  repurchase shares and pay interest on trust preferred securities 
the corporation and the bank  in declaring and paying dividends  are also limited insofar as minimum capital requirements of regulatory authorities must be maintained 
the corporation and the bank comply with such capital requirements 
if the corporation or the bank were unable to comply with the minimum capital requirements  it could result in regulatory actions that could have a material impact on the corporation 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the corporation has various contractual obligations  such as long term borrowings  that are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as certain minimum lease payments for the use of banking and operations 
table of contents offices under operating lease agreements  are not recognized as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements  but are required to be disclosed 
each of these arrangements affects the corporation s determination of sufficient liquidity 
the following table summarizes significant contractual obligations and commitments at december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
in addition  the table reflects the timing of principal payments on outstanding borrowings 
additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  as referenced in the following table 
contractual payments due by period in thousands less than year years years after years total lease commitments note long term debt note total contractual payment obligations arrangements to fund credit products or guarantee financing take the form of loan commitments including lines of credit on revolving credit structures and letters of credit 
approvals for these arrangements are obtained in the same manner as loans 
generally  cash flows  collateral value and a risk assessment are considered when determining the amount and structure of credit arrangements 
commitments to extend credit in the form of consumer  commercial real estate and business loans at december  were as follows in thousands commercial business and real estate consumer revolving credit residential mortgage credit performance standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit total loan commitments historically  many of the commitments expire without being fully drawn  therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
obligations also take the form of commitments to purchase loans 
at december   the corporation did not have any firm commitments to purchase loans 
contingencies and risk the corporation enters into certain transactions that may either contain risks or represent contingencies 
these risks or contingencies may take the form of concentrations of credit risk or litigation 
disclosure of these arrangements is found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
risk management the nature of the banking business  which involves paying interest on deposits at varying rates and terms and charging interest on loans at other rates and terms  creates interest rate risk 
as a result  earnings and the market value of assets and liabilities are subject to fluctuations  which arise due to changes in the level and directions of interest rates 
management s objective is to minimize the fluctuation in the net interest margin caused by changes in interest rates using cost effective strategies and tools 
the bank manages several forms of interest rate risk  including asset liability mismatch  basis and prepayment risk 
the corporation purchases amortizing loan pools and investment securities in which the underlying assets are residential mortgage loans subject to prepayments 
the actual principal reduction on these assets varies from the expected contractual principal reduction due to principal prepayments resulting from borrowers elections to refinance the underlying mortgages based on market and other conditions 
prepayment rate projections utilize actual prepayment speed experience and available market information on like kind instruments 
the prepayment rates form the basis for income recognition of premiums or discounts on the related assets 
changes in prepayment estimates may cause the earnings recognized on these assets to vary over the term that the assets are held  creating volatility in the net interest margin 
prepayment rate assumptions are monitored and updated monthly to reflect actual activity and the most recent market projections 
basis risk exists as a result of having much of the bank s earning assets priced using either the prime rate or the us treasury yield curve  while much of the liability portfolio is priced using the cd yield curve or libor yield curve 
these different yield curves typically do not move in lock step with one another 

table of contents measuring and managing interest rate risk is a dynamic process that management performs continually to meet the objective of maintaining a stable net interest margin 
this process relies chiefly on simulation modeling of shocks to the balance sheet under a variety of interest rate scenarios  including parallel and non parallel rate shifts  such as the forward yield curves for both short and long term interest rates 
the results of these shocks are measured in two forms first  the impact on the net interest margin and earnings over one and two year time frames  and second  the impact on the market value of equity 
in addition to measuring the basis risks and prepayment risks noted above  simulations also quantify the earnings impact of rate changes and the cost benefit of hedging strategies 
the following table shows the anticipated effect on net interest income in parallel shift up or down interest rate scenarios 
these shifts are assumed to begin on january  for the december  data and on january  for the december  data and evenly ramp up or down over a six month period 
the effect on net interest income would be for the next twelve months 
given the interest environment in the periods presented  a basis point drop in rate is unlikely and has not been shown 
projected percentage change in net interest income at december interest rate scenario basis points no change basis points basis points the isolated modeling environment  assuming no action by management  shows that the corporation s net interest income volatility is less than under probable single direction scenarios 
the corporation s one year forward earnings are slightly asset sensitive  which will result in net interest income moving in the same direction as future interest rates 
the corporation s interest rate risk profile is little changed from to  reflecting management s intentions to maintain a low level of interest rate risk and to benefit modestly from a rising rate environment 
the corporation maintains an overall interest rate management strategy that incorporates structuring of investments  purchased funds  variable rate loan products  and derivatives in order to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings or market values 
the bank continues to employ hedges to mitigate interest rate risk 
borrowings totaling over million have been employed which reset their rates monthly or quarterly based on the level of long term interest rates specifically  the year constant maturity swap rate rather than short term rates  to offset the effect of mortgage prepayments on asset yields 
there is a high correlation between changes in the year constant maturity swap rate and the year mortgage rate 
additionally  million notional amount in interest rate swaps were in force to reduce interest rate risk  and million of interest rate caps were employed to protect the interest margin from rising interest rates in the future 
capital resources total stockholders equity was million at december   an increase of million from december  the change in stockholders equity for the year was attributable to million in earnings  million primarily from the issuance of common stock relating to the southern financial merger and an increase of million in net accumulated other comprehensive income oci 
this was partially offset by dividends paid of million  or per share 
capital was also reduced by million from the repurchase of  shares of the corporation s common stock at an average price of 
the corporation is authorized to repurchase an additional  shares under its stock repurchase program 

table of contents the corporation is required to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of core capital to adjusted quarterly average assets leverage ratio and of tier and total regulatory capital to risk weighted assets 
the actual regulatory capital ratios and required ratios for capital adequacy purposes under firrea and the ratios to be categorized as well capitalized under prompt corrective action regulations are summarized in the following table

regulatory capital increased as a result of the million of equity capital issued as part of the merger transaction  the inclusion of million of southern financial s trust preferred securities and the increased allowance for loan losses 
these additions were partially offset by the million of additional goodwill and other intangible assets arising from the merger that are deducted from regulatory capital 
on february   the corporation announced its intention to call provident trust ii  a million dividend trust preferred security on march  these securities will be excluded from capital ratio calculations beginning march  following the redemption  the corporation s capital ratios are expected to continue to comply with all applicable regulatory capital requirements and the corporation is expected to continue to be considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes

earnings for included the impacts of per share in net securities losses associated with the balance sheet restructure in the second quarter  per share of merger costs and per share of costs related to professional services associated with sarbanes oxley compliance 
increases of million in the net interest margin after provision for loan losses and million in non interest income more than offset a million increase in non interest expense and a million increase in income tax expense  resulting in a million increase in net income 
the financial results in reflect the corporation s commitment to produce positive core results by executing the business strategies of broadening its presence and customer base in the virginia and metropolitan washington markets  growing commercial business in all markets  and enhancing core business results in all markets 
these items are discussed in more detail  as follows 
net interest income the corporation s principal source of revenue is net interest income  the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on deposits and borrowings 
interest income is presented on a tax equivalent basis to recognize associated tax benefits in order to provide a basis for comparison of yields with taxable earning assets 
the tables on the following pages analyze the reasons for the changes from year to year in the principal elements that comprise net interest income 
rate and volume variances presented for each component will not total the variances presented on totals of interest income and interest expense because of shifts from year to year in the relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

table of contents net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased million to million in from million in the net interest margin expanded to from  despite a challenging rate environment 
total interest income increased million while total interest expense declined million 
the overall improvement in net interest income and the net yield is partially a result of the addition of southern financial s assets and liabilities for the last eight months of while total interest income increased million from to  the yield on earning assets declined to in compared to in the basis point reduction in net yield reflects the impact of prepayments and refinancings caused generally by the lower interest rates that prevailed during the effects of the lower rates on net interest income were mitigated by the addition of loans associated with the southern financial merger for eight months of and the organic provident loan growth in the year 
the restructure of the balance sheet in the second quarter of  in which million in low margin securities were liquidated coincident with the merger  had a positive impact on the margin 
interest income lost from non accruing loans was million in  compared to million in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities declined to in from in the primary cause of the basis point decline came from the rates paid on brokered time deposits whose average rate paid declined from in to in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities also benefited from the extinguishment of million in debt and lower rates paid on direct time deposits 
the debt was substantially replaced with borrowings bearing lower interest rates 
the million increase in non interest bearing deposits also had a positive impact on the net yield as an interest free source of funds 
as a result of derivative transactions undertaken to mitigate the effect of interest rate risk on the bank  interest income decreased by million and interest expense decreased by million  resulting in an increase of million in net interest income relating to derivative transactions for the year ending december  future growth in net interest income will depend upon consumer and commercial loan demand  growth in deposits and the general level of interest rates 
provision for loan losses the corporation continued to emphasize quality underwriting as well as aggressive management of charge offs and potential problem loans  resulting in a provision for loan losses of million in compared to million in net charge offs were million  or of average loans  in compared to million  or of average loans in consumer loan net charge offs as a percentage of average consumer loans were in compared to in during  net charge offs in the acquired residential mortgage and other consumer loans declined million and thousand  respectively 
both portfolios experienced an improvement in net charge offs as a percentage of average loans in their respective portfolios 
beginning in late  the corporation changed its policy with respect to net charge offs of demand deposit overdrafts reclassified as loans 
previously  net charge offs were reflected in other non interest expense 
these net charge offs are now part of the allowance for loan losses  in order to be consistent with the treatment of all other loans 
commercial business net charge offs as a percentage of average commercial business loans were  an increase from in as part of the transition  provident concentrated its efforts on converting the commercial loan portfolio of southern financial to provident s processing systems  strengthening loan file documentation and consolidating operations 
as the portfolio was assimilated into provident s processing and credit culture  the level of charge offs for the remainder of the year was higher than provident s pre merger levels  reflecting the blended net charge off rate of the two institutions 
the combined decline in the consumer categories substantially offset the increase in net charge offs associated with the commercial portfolio

when it became apparent in the second quarter of that the corporation would be required to recognize one time tax benefits of million  management elected to reset a portion of its borrowing cost at beneficial rates by extinguishing million of debt at a corresponding loss of million 
these items are discussed in more detail  as follows 
net interest income net interest income on a tax equivalent basis totaled million in  compared to million in  while the net interest margin expanded to from 
a decline of million in total interest income was more than offset by a decline in total interest expense of million 
generally  favorable changes in the mix of interest bearing liabilities offset growth in earning assets at lower yields  primarily in the investment portfolio 
the yield on earning assets was in  compared to in  a decline of basis points  reflecting the low interest rate environment in the million decrease in total interest income was primarily attributable to prepayments of higher yielding loans in the loan portfolios that were partially replaced with lower yielding loans  causing a negative impact to interest income of million 
the excess proceeds from the loan portfolios were deployed in investment securities at lower yields  resulting in a decrease in interest income of million 
interest income lost from non accruing loans was million in  compared to million in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities declined basis points to in  versus in the favorable changes in deposit mix  from higher rate cds into lower rate demand and savings deposits  had a favorable impact on interest expense of million 
interest expense benefited further from a million increase in average noninterest bearing deposit balances during the year 
while the higher level of average borrowings in caused an increase in interest expense of million  interest expense on borrowings benefited by million from the repricing of floating rate borrowings throughout the year and the resetting of rates on term fhlb borrowings via the extinguishment transactions during the year 
as a result of derivative transactions undertaken to mitigate the affect of interest rate risk on the bank  interest income decreased by thousand and interest expense decreased by thousand  for a total decrease of thousand in net interest income relating to derivative transactions for the year ending december  
table of contents provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was million in  exceeding net charge offs by million 
the slight increase in the provision resulted from lower charge offs and an increase in loan balances of million 
this was partially offset by the impact of an overall decrease in the allowance of basis points as compared to total loans 
net charge offs were million in compared to million in of the million decrease in net charge offs  million related to the acquired consumer loan portfolio and thousand related to commercial business loans 
both portfolios experienced an improvement in net charge offs as a percentage of average loans in their respective portfolios 
consumer loan net charge offs as a percentage of average consumer loans were in compared to in commercial business net charge offs as a percentage of average commercial business loans were  a decline from in on an overall basis  net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were in compared to in non interest income total non interest income declined slightly to million in total non interest income  excluding the net losses described below  increased to million in the improvement in non interest income continued to be driven by deposit service charges  which increased million  or  to million in the increase in deposit fees was primarily the result of continued strong retail and commercial deposit account growth

higher rate term fhlb borrowings totaling million were extinguished at a loss of million and replaced with lower rate term fhlb borrowings 
the majority of net gains on the sales of securities were the result of re balancing the investment portfolio in anticipation of the heavy prepayments of mortgage backed securities 
to a lesser extent  net securities gains were realized on the sale of securities held specifically as part of asset liability strategies put in place to mitigate potential additional premium amortization due to mortgage loan prepayments 
non interest expense non interest expense of million for increased million  or  from over million of the increase was directly attributable to the bank s network expansion  impacting salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and furniture and fixture expense 
network expansion represented the full effect of nine net new banking offices opened in  as well as nine net new banking offices opened in the growth in non interest expense  other than that which was impacted by branch expansion  was contained to a growth rate of approximately 
increases in external processing fees were related to volume increases and additional outsourced services 
other non interest expense decreased million from  due primarily to the elimination of a recourse reserve established in related to securitized loans 
income taxes provident recorded income tax expense of million based on pre tax income of million 
included in tax expense in was a one time benefit of million associated with the recognition of accumulated state income tax benefits of million 
based on the actual and projected level of earnings in the applicable subsidiary relative to the projected earnings in the bank  it had become more likely than not that accumulated deferred benefits related to the subsidiary would be utilized in the foreseeable future
