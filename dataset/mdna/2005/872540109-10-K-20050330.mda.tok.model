item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking information and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to various factors  including those discussed in item of this report under the section entitled safe harbor statements under the private securities litigation reform act of results of operations overview our financial performance for the week fiscal year ended january  fiscal as compared to our week fiscal year ended january  fiscal is summarized below 
net sales for fiscal were billion  a increase over the week fiscal period last year 
driven by a same store sales increase at marmaxx  our internal combination of tj maxx and marshalls  consolidated same store sales increased in fiscal over the prior year on a comparable to week basis  with approximately percentage points of this increase coming from the favorable effect of currency exchange rates of our winners and tk maxx businesses 
we increased our number of stores by in fiscal ending the fiscal year with  stores in operation 
selling square footage also grew by in fiscal net income for fiscal was million compared to million in the week period last year 
fiscal net income reflects the impact of a fourth quarter  one time  non cash  after tax charge of million  or 
per share  relating to lease accounting see note a to the consolidated financial statements while fiscal includes the benefit of the rd week  estimated at million after tax  or 
per share 
excluding these items  net income would be million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  an increase 
we believe this presentation reflects our results on a more comparable basis  and is useful in understanding the underlying earnings trends in our business 
diluted earnings per share was in fiscal as compared to per share in the prior year 
excluding the items noted above  diluted earnings per share would have been in fiscal compared to in fiscal  or an increase of 
we believe this presentation reflects our earnings per share on a more comparable basis  and is useful in understanding the underlying earnings trends in our business 
our reported operating results led to an after tax return on average shareholders equity of for the fiscal year ended january  our pre tax margin the ratio of pre tax income to net sales declined from in fiscal to in fiscal the decline was driven by cost of sales  including buying and occupancy costs  which increased 
as a percent of sales over last year  with the cumulative charge for the adjustment of our lease accounting practices amounting to 
of this increase 
in addition  
of the increase was due to the favorable impact of the rd week on the prior year s cost of sales ratio 
selling  general and administrative costs were up 
as a percent of sales in fiscal over the prior year 
we continued to generate strong cash flows from operations which allowed us to fund our stock repurchase program as well as our capital investment needs 
during fiscal  we repurchased million of our shares at a cost of million 
average per store inventories  including inventory on hand at our distribution centers were up at the end of fiscal as compared to the prior year end period 
our liquid inventory position enhances our ability to take advantage of buying opportunities in the marketplace 
the following is a summary of the operating results of tjx at the consolidated level 
this discussion is followed by an overview of operating results by segment 
all references to earnings per share are diluted earnings per share unless otherwise indicated and diluted earnings per share for prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the new accounting rules relating to our contingently convertible debt 
see note a to our consolidated financial statements 
net sales net sales for tjx for our fiscal year ended january  totaled billion  an increase over sales of billion for the fiscal year ended january  our reporting period for fiscal included weeks compared to weeks in both fiscal and the fiscal year ended january  fiscal 
the rd week in fiscal added incremental 
table of contents sales of approximately million  as compared to fiscal and fiscal the net sales for fiscal of billion represented an increase over sales of billion for our fiscal year ended january  the increase in net sales for fiscal over fiscal  reflects approximately from new stores  from same store sales growth and from the acquisition of bob s stores  partially offset by approximately a reduction to the growth rate due to fiscal having one less week than fiscal bob s stores was acquired on december  and our sales results for fiscal include bob s stores from the date of acquisition as compared to a full year for fiscal the increase in net sales for fiscal over fiscal includes approximately from new stores  from same store sales growth  with the balance primarily due to the rd week 
sales growth in both fiscal and fiscal were favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates 
new stores are our major source of sales growth 
our consolidated store count increased by in fiscal and in fiscal over the respective prior year period 
our selling square footage increased by in fiscal and in fiscal  in each case over the prior year 
bob s stores is excluded from fiscal store count and selling square footage calculations  as it was acquired late in fiscal our acquisition of bob s stores on december   added units as of the end of fiscal net sales for bob s stores are included in our results from the date of acquisition 
we expect to add stores net of store closings in the fiscal year ending january  fiscal  a projected increase in our consolidated store base  and we expect to increase our selling square footage base by 
net sales for fiscal reflect strong demand for jewelry and accessories  women s apparel and footwear  partially offset by weaker demand for men s apparel and home fashions 
the growth in consolidated same store sales for fiscal over the prior year was driven by a same store sales increase at marmaxx 
marmaxx continued its program of expanding certain departments in its stores and ended the year with tj maxx stores with expanded jewelry accessories departments and marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments 
these initiatives were significant factors in marmaxx achieving a same store sales increase in fiscal consolidated same store sales growth of in fiscal reflects the impact of unseasonable weather in the first half of that year 
same store sales growth in both fiscal and fiscal benefited by approximately percentage points from foreign currency exchange rates 
we define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years  or in other words  stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation 
we classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store criteria 
we determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year  unless a store is closed 
we calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned 
relocated stores and stores that are increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store and we believe that the impact of these stores on the same store percentage is immaterial 
consolidated and divisional same store sales are calculated in us dollars 
we also show divisional same store sales in local currency for our foreign divisions  because this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates  and we believe it is a more appropriate measure of their operating performance 
the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended january weeks net sales cost of sales  including buying and occupancy costs selling  general and administrative expenses interest expense  net income before provision for income taxes cost of sales  including buying and occupancy costs cost of sales  including buying and occupancy costs  as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal our consolidated merchandise margin was essentially flat to the prior year 
throughout fiscal  the marmaxx division continued to effectively execute our merchandising and inventory management strategies  maintaining a liquid inventory position and buying close to need  all of which led to improved 
table of contents merchandise margin at this division 
however  this improved merchandise margin at marmaxx in fiscal was offset by reduced merchandise margin at our other divisions  most of which experienced higher markdowns 
the increase in this ratio in fiscal includes a 
increase due to a million non cash charge million after tax to conform our lease accounting practices to generally accepted accounting principles 
see note a to the consolidated financial statements under the caption lease accounting 
this ratio in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  also reflects an increase of approximately 
due to the absence of the rd week in fiscal as the sales volume from the extra week helped lever certain fixed costs in fiscal the balance of the increase in the ratio in fiscal is primarily due to higher cost of sales ratios at divisions other than marmaxx  which represent a greater proportion of the consolidated results in fiscal as compared to fiscal the improvement in the cost of sales ratio in fiscal over fiscal reflects a significant improvement in merchandise margin  primarily in the second half of fiscal the improved merchandise margin contributed to an approximate 
reduction in our consolidated cost of sales ratio 
successful execution of our inventory and merchandising strategies and buying closer to need led to this improvement 
the contribution from improved merchandise margin was partially offset by higher store occupancy costs as a percentage of sales due to lower than planned same store sales growth and higher distribution costs  as a result of opening our new tj maxx distribution facility in pittston  pennsylvania 
store occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales increased by 
for fiscal over fiscal and distribution costs as a percentage of net sales increased by 
the cost of sales ratio was favorably impacted by the rd week in the fiscal reporting period  estimated to be a 
improvement in this ratio  as the sales volume from this extra week helped lever certain fixed costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal and in both fiscal and fiscal the increase in this ratio in fiscal was primarily due to a 
increase in advertising costs as a percentage of sales as a result of the inclusion of bob s stores for a full fiscal year in our consolidated results 
bob s stores operates with a higher advertising cost ratio than our off price divisions 
in comparing fiscal to fiscal  store payroll costs as a percentage of sales increased as a result of the delevering impact of less than planned sales  but this increase in the expense ratio was offset by the effect of higher costs in fiscal due to a pre tax million litigation charge 
the litigation charge was for the estimated cost of settling claims related to four california lawsuits that alleged tjx had improperly classified store managers and assistant store managers as exempt from california overtime laws 
the lawsuits were settled in fiscal for slightly less than million 
interest expense  net interest expense  net of interest income  was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal interest income was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the reduction in interest income in fiscal and as compared to fiscal was due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates 
income taxes our effective annual income tax rate was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal and the increase in this rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal were primarily due to increases in state income tax rates 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal also reflects the favorable effect of the tax benefit for payment of executive retirement benefits in exchange for the termination of split dollar arrangements as described in note i to the consolidated financial statements 
the american jobs creation act of ajca enacted on october  will allow companies to repatriate the undistributed foreign earnings of their foreign operations in fiscal at an effective rate of 
the company is evaluating the impact of the act on tjx 
net income net income was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal net income per share was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal diluted earnings per share reflect the impact of retroactive implementation of a new accounting pronouncement that requires the inclusion of shares associated with contingently convertible debt in the calculation of diluted earnings per share even if the contingencies have not been met 
this accounting change had an adverse effect of 
on our diluted earnings per share in fiscal and 
on previously reported diluted earnings per share in both fiscal and net income for fiscal includes the after tax effect of the million cumulative pre tax charge associated with our lease accounting practices  which reduced net income in fiscal by million  or 
per share 
we estimate that the rd week in fiscal added approximately million to net income and 
to our 
table of contents earnings per share  and that favorable changes in currency exchange rates during fiscal and fiscal added approximately 
to our earnings per share in each year 
the increase in earnings per share  on a percentage basis in all periods  increased more than the related earnings as a result of the impact of our share repurchase program 
during fiscal we repurchased million shares of our stock at a cost of million and we plan to continue our share repurchase program in fiscal with planned purchases of approximately million 
segment information the following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments 
we consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment 
we evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment profit or loss  which we define as pre tax income before general corporate expense and interest expense  net 
segment profit or loss  as defined by tjx  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities 
in addition  this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity 
more detailed information about our segments  including a reconciliation of segment profit or loss to income before provision for income taxes can be found in note n to the consolidated financial statements 
segment profit or loss for fiscal includes each segment s share of the cumulative pre tax charge relating to lease accounting 
see note a to the consolidated financial statements under the caption lease accounting 
marmaxx fiscal year ended january dollars in millions weeks net sales segment profit segment profit as of net sales percent increase decrease in same store sales stores in operation at end of period selling square footage at end of period in thousands marmaxx posted a same store sales increase in fiscal  compared to a decrease in same store sales for fiscal same store sales growth was driven by strong sales in the jewelry  accessories and footwear categories  as well as women s sportswear  with fashion trends in these categories helping to drive customer demand 
sales for men s apparel and home fashions in fiscal were soft 
same store sales benefited from the continuation of the marmaxx program whereby certain departments in the tj maxx and marshalls stores were expanded 
marmaxx ended fiscal with tj maxx stores with expanded jewelry and accessories departments and marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments as compared to tj maxx stores with expanded jewelry and accessories departments and marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments at the end of fiscal these initiatives drove overall sales in the stores with the expanded departments in addition to increasing sales in these categories and were significant factors in marmaxx achieving a same stores sales increase in fiscal segment profit increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  despite the impact of a million charge for its share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment 
the lease accounting charge reduced fiscal segment profit margin by 
marmaxx continued to effectively execute its merchandising and inventory strategies  aggressively managing the liquidity of its inventory and buying and shipping goods close to need  all of which led to strong markon and improved merchandise margins 
for fiscal  merchandise margins increased 
marmaxx also continued to effectively manage expenses in fiscal these improvements in segment profit margin were partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs of 
as a percentage of sales  
of which represents the impact of the lease accounting charge 
segment profit and segment profit margin for fiscal as compared to fiscal is also impacted by the benefit of the rd week in the fiscal reporting period described below 
the increase in segment profit and profit margin for fiscal as compared to fiscal reflects marmaxx s sharp execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies and effective expense controls in fiscal marmaxx was able to buy closer to need in fiscal  leading to a strong markon and an improved merchandise margin  especially in the second half of the year 
the rd week in fiscal had an estimated favorable impact of 
on the segment profit margin for that year  as the sales volume from this 
table of contents extra week helped lever certain fixed costs 
the increase in segment profit and segment profit margin in fiscal as compared to fiscal also reflect the effect of higher costs in fiscal due to the million litigation charge discussed above 
we added a net of new stores tj maxx or marshalls in fiscal and increased total selling square footage of the division by 
we expect to open a net of new stores in fiscal  increasing the marmaxx store base by and to increase the selling square footage of the division by 
we plan to add expanded jewelry and accessories departments in approximately existing tj maxx stores as well as all new tj maxx stores and to add approximately expanded footwear departments in existing and new marshalls stores 
winners and homesense fiscal year ended january us dollars in millions weeks net sales segment profit segment profit as of net sales percent increase in same store sales us currency local currency stores in operation at end of period winners homesense selling square footage at end of period in thousands winners homesense same store sales in local currency for winners and homesense  our canadian businesses  increased by in both fiscal and fiscal segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal include a million charge for this division s share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment 
the growth in the winners segment profit in fiscal over the prior year was due to favorable currency exchange rates 
the segment profit margin for fiscal of was below fiscal segment profit margin  primarily due to lower merchandise margins  which decreased 
from the prior year  primarily driven by markdowns 
sales in the second half of fiscal slowed considerably from the first half  primarily due to unseasonable weather and a promotional retail environment 
this  along with winners buying based on the strength of its first half sales  resulted in excess inventories  requiring the division to take aggressive markdowns to clear merchandise in the second half of the year 
the lease accounting charge reduced segment profit margin by 
with the balance of the segment profit margin reduction coming largely from the increasing impact of homesense on the division s combined results 
homesense is at an earlier stage of development and therefore operates with higher expense ratios than does winners 
winners and homesense segment profit in fiscal increased over the segment profit in fiscal approximately two thirds of the increase in segment profit in fiscal over fiscal was due to changes in currency exchange rates 
winners and homesense segment profit margin for fiscal was below that of fiscal this reduction reflects increased markdowns at winners and the increasing impact of homesense on their combined results 
we opened winners stores and homesense stores in fiscal  and expanded selling square footage in canada by 
we expect to add a net of winners and homesense stores in fiscal  increasing our total canadian store base by  and increasing selling square footage by 
the store counts include the winners portion and homesense portion of this division s superstores which either combine a winners store with a homesense store or operates them side by side 
as of january  we operated superstores and expect to have a total of superstores at the end of fiscal 
table of contents tk maxx fiscal year ended january us dollars in millions weeks net sales segment profit segment profit as of net sales percent increase in same store sales us currency local currency stores in operation at end of period selling square footage at end of period in thousands tk maxx  operating in the united kingdom and ireland had a same store sales increase of in local currency in fiscal on top of a increase in fiscal tk maxx s same store sales in fiscal were adversely affected by unseasonable weather patterns in the first half of the year and a highly promotional retail environment in the latter half of the year 
in light of the retail environment under which tk maxx operated in fiscal  this division was effective in managing inventories and expenses to minimize the impact on segment profit margins 
segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal include a million charge for tk maxx s share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment 
the significant growth in tk maxx s segment profit in fiscal is attributable to the increase in sales as well as the favorable benefit of foreign currency exchange rates 
the segment profit margin in fiscal decreased 
to  primarily due to an increase in occupancy costs of 
as a percentage of sales  of which 
was attributable to the cumulative lease accounting charge 
segment profit for fiscal increased over the segment profit for fiscal with approximately one quarter of this growth coming from currency exchange rates 
the strong segment performance in fiscal was driven by tk maxx s strong execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies 
we added new tk maxx stores in fiscal  and increased the division s selling square footage by 
selling square footage was favorably impacted by the addition of mezzanines in some of our existing stores 
we plan to open an additional tk maxx stores in fiscal  and expand selling square footage by 
homegoods fiscal year ended january dollars in millions weeks net sales segment profit segment profit as of net sales percent increase in same store sales stores in operation at end of period selling square footage at end of period in thousands homegoods same store sales grew in fiscal  compared to a increase in fiscal segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of net sales include a million charge for homegoods share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment 
homegoods segment profit declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the business was adversely affected by weaker retail demand for home fashion product as well as an unfavorable merchandise mix  which led to a modest same store sales increase 
consequently  the division took additional markdowns  which contributed to a reduction in its merchandise margin 
the decline in segment profit margin from in fiscal to in fiscal is primarily due to this reduction in merchandise margin 
segment profit margin was also impacted by a 
increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales including 
due to the lease accounting charge and a 
increase in distribution center 
table of contents costs as a percentage of net sales 
these expense ratio increases reflect the negative impact on expense ratios of a same store sales increase 
in fiscal  segment profit increased over the segment profit of fiscal despite only a modest increase in same store sales in fiscal homegoods segment profit margin reflected the solid execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies in fiscal  and a reduction in distribution and administrative expenses as the business expanded over fiscal we opened a net of homegoods stores in fiscal  a increase  and increased selling square footage of the division by 
in fiscal  we plan to add a net of new homegoods stores including freestanding and superstore formats and increase selling square footage by aj wright fiscal year ended january dollars in millions weeks net sales segment loss profit segment loss profit as of net sales percent increase in same store sales stores in operation at end of period selling square footage at end of period in thousands aj wright s same store sales increased for fiscal compared to an increase in same store sales for fiscal segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of net sales include a million charge for aj wright s share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment 
we believe that the aj wright customer is more sensitive to economic factors  such as higher energy costs  and that this had an impact on the division s sales performance in fiscal we also believe that a weaker demand in urban fashion trends impacted sales during the year 
these sales trends caused us to take higher markdowns to clear inventories and to reposition our merchandise mix 
segment profit margin for fiscal reflects a reduction in merchandise margins of  primarily due to this higher markdown activity 
we believe that the pace of store openings in fiscal  especially later in the year  may have been too aggressive for this young division  and placed a strain on operations 
in addition  the lower than planned sales volume for fiscal negatively impacted expense ratios for occupancy costs  distribution center costs and store payroll 
distribution center costs were also impacted by expense increases relating to aj wright s new distribution facility in indiana 
in fiscal  the improvement in aj wright s segment profit  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to the impact of improved merchandising and strong inventory management  which led to improved merchandise margins 
segment profit for fiscal also included a million gain in connection with an agreement to vacate a store property 
we added new aj wright stores in fiscal  increasing selling square footage by 
in fiscal  we plan to add new stores and increase selling square footage by 
bob s stores fiscal was the first full fiscal year for bob s stores as a tjx division 
bob s stores now operates stores and recorded fiscal sales of million and a segment loss of million 
in fiscal  we built the bob s stores organization and we continued to refine the concept  including repositioning the division s promotional activity  improving its inventory management  fine tuning its product assortment and testing a smaller store size 
for fiscal  we plan to open bob s stores and increase selling square footage by 

table of contents general corporate expense fiscal year ended january dollars in millions weeks general corporate expense general corporate expense for segment reporting purposes are those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments 
this item includes the costs of the corporate office  including the compensation and benefits for senior corporate management  payroll and operating costs of the non divisional departments for accounting and budgeting  internal audit  treasury  investor relations  tax  risk management  legal  human resources and systems  and the occupancy and office maintenance costs associated with the corporate staff 
in addition  general corporate expense includes the cost of benefits for existing retirees and non operating costs and other gains and losses not attributable to individual divisions 
general corporate expense is included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
the increase in general corporate expense in fiscal over the prior year reflects the change in net foreign exchange gains and losses  the majority of which relates to derivative contracts that hedge foreign currency exposures on intercompany activity 
in addition  general corporate expense for fiscal reflects an increase in general corporate overhead  incremental audit fees and costs related to the start up of our e commerce businesses 
this increase was offset in part by a million reduction in contributions to the tjx foundation in fiscal  compared to fiscal the increase in general corporate expense from fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of contributions to the tjx foundation of million in fiscal in fiscal  there were no contributions to the tjx foundation 
this increase in general corporate expense was partially offset by the change in net foreign exchange gains and losses and related hedging activity 
the majority of this item relates to derivative contracts that provide an economic hedge of foreign currency exposures on divisional inventory commitments and intercompany activity 
the changes in the fair value of the contracts are reflected currently in earnings 
in fiscal and for the first nine months of fiscal  the realized gains or losses on these contracts were allocated to the appropriate division at the time the contracts were settled 
effective with the fourth quarter ended january  we began including the unrealized values of these contracts within the individual segments 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the cash generated from operating activities each of these fiscal years is largely due to strong operating earnings 
the difference in net cash provided from operating activities from year to year is largely driven by the change in inventory  net of accounts payable  from prior year end levels 
in fiscal this change in net inventory position resulted in a use of cash of million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal average per store inventories  including inventory on hand at our distribution centers  at january  increased only compared to the prior year  whereas inventories per store at january  were up compared to the prior year 
this change in net inventory position and the trend in inventory levels per store reflect our decision to raise the level of store inventories in fiscal over fiscal levels and to maintain them at fiscal levels in fiscal effective with the third quarter ended october   we began to accrue for inventory obligations at the time inventory is shipped rather than when received and accepted by tjx 
this accrual as of january  increased both inventory and accounts payable by million and thus had no impact on cash flow from operations 
the cash flows from operating activities for fiscal were also impacted by a larger increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities than in fiscal  reflecting increased accruals at the end of fiscal for rent and landlord allowances  property additions  gift cards and payroll 
the cash flows from operating activities for fiscal were impacted by a smaller increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities at the end of fiscal as compared to fiscal  reflecting reduced accruals for property additions and the payment of the california lawsuits in fiscal the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities also reflects cash expenditures of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal charged against our discontinued operations reserve as discussed in more detail below 

table of contents operating cash flows in fiscal  and to a greater extent in fiscal  were favorably affected by deferred tax benefits related to payments against the discontinued operations reserve and increased accelerated depreciation on certain assets allowed for us income tax purposes 
cash flows from operating activities were reduced by contributions to our qualified pension fund of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal all of the contributions to the pension fund in fiscal  and were made on a voluntary basis 
discontinued operations reserve we have a reserve for potential future obligations of discontinued operations that relates primarily to real estate leases of former tjx businesses that have been sold or spun off 
the reserve reflects tjx s estimation of its cost for claims that have been  or are likely to be  made against tjx for liability as an original lessee or guarantor of the leases when the assignees of the leases filed for bankruptcy  after mitigation of the number and cost of lease obligations 
at january   substantially all leases of discontinued operations that were rejected in the bankruptcies and for which the landlords asserted liability against tjx had been resolved 
it is possible that there will be future costs for leases from these discontinued operations that were not terminated or have not expired 
we do not expect to incur any material costs related to our discontinued operations in excess of our reserve 
the reserve balance amounted to million as of january  and million as of january  we may also be contingently liable on up to leases of bj s wholesale club  another former tjx business  for which bj s wholesale club is primarily liable 
our reserve for discontinued operations does not reflect these leases  because we believe that the likelihood of any future liability to tjx with respect to these leases is remote due to the current financial condition of bj s wholesale club 
off balance sheet liabilities we have contingent obligations on leases  for which we were a lessee or guarantor  which were assigned to third parties without tjx being released by the landlords 
over many years  we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties 
with the exception of leases of our discontinued operations discussed above  we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned leases  and accordingly  we do not expect that such leases will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them 
we also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate 
we estimate the undiscounted obligations  not reflected in our reserves  of leases of closed stores of continuing operations  bj s wholesale club leases discussed in note k to the consolidated financial statements  and properties of our discontinued operations that we have sublet  if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations  is approximately million as of january  we believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to tjx and  to the extent they do  will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors 
we are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold  specified environmental matters or certain income taxes 
these obligations are typically limited in time and amount 
there are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations 
investing activities our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last two years as set forth in the table below fiscal year ended january in millions new stores store renovations and improvements office and distribution centers capital expenditures 
table of contents we expect that capital expenditures will approximate million for fiscal this includes million for new stores  million for store renovations  expansions and improvements and million for our office and distribution centers 
our planned rate of growth in selling square footage per year is approximately  on a consolidated basis  for the next several years 
our rate of store growth and the planned expansion and renovation of existing stores  are the major factors in our increase in planned capital expenditures 
investing activities for fiscal includes a net cash outflow of million to acquire bob s stores as discussed in note b to the consolidated financial statements 
financing activities cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the majority of this outflow relates to our share repurchase program 
we spent million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal under our stock repurchase programs 
we repurchased million shares in fiscal  million shares in fiscal  and million shares in fiscal all shares repurchased were retired with the exception of  shares purchased in fiscal and  shares purchased in fiscal  which are held in treasury 
during may  we completed a billion stock repurchase program and announced our intention to repurchase an additional billion of common stock 
since the inception of the new billion stock repurchase program  as of january   we have repurchased million shares at a total cost of million under this program 
all of these repurchased share numbers reflect the two for one stock split distributed in may financing activities also included scheduled principal payments on long term debt of million in fiscal  and million in fiscal we declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled 
per share in fiscal  
per share in fiscal  and 
per share in fiscal cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal financing activities also include proceeds of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal from the exercise of employee stock options 
these stock option exercises  along with vesting of restricted stock awards  also provided tax benefits of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal these tax benefits are included in cash provided by operating activities 
we traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations  short term bank borrowings and the issuance of short term commercial paper 
during fiscal  we entered into a million five year revolving credit facility and in fiscal we renewed our day revolving credit facility for million 
effective march   we extended the day agreement until july   with substantially all of the terms and conditions of the original facility remaining unchanged 
we anticipate that during the year we will negotiate new agreements increasing the aggregate size of our revolving credit facilities and extending their maturity 
the credit facilities do not require any compensating balances  however  tjx must maintain certain leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios 
based on our current financial condition  we believe that non compliance with these covenants is remote 
the revolving credit facilities are used as backup to our commercial paper program 
as of january  there were no outstanding amounts under our credit facilities 
the maximum amount of our us short term borrowings outstanding was million during fiscal and million during fiscal there were no short term borrowings during fiscal the weighted average interest rate on our us short term borrowings was in fiscal and in fiscal as of january   we had credit lines totaling c million for our canadian subsidiary 
the maximum amount outstanding under our canadian credit line was c million during fiscal  c million in fiscal  and c million in fiscal the funding requirements of our canadian operations were largely provided by tjx 
we believe that our current credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs 
see note c to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our long term debt and available financing sources 

table of contents contractual obligations as of january   we had payment obligations including current installments under long term debt arrangements  leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows in thousands payments due by year less more than than long term contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations operating lease commitments capital lease obligations purchase obligations the above maturity table assumes that all holders of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their put options in fiscal the note holders also have put options available to them in fiscal if none of the put options are exercised and the notes are not redeemed or converted  the notes will mature in fiscal the lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent and do not include costs for insurance  real estate taxes and common area maintenance costs that we are obligated to pay 
these costs were approximately one third of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended january  our purchase obligations consist of purchase orders for merchandise  purchase orders for capital expenditures  supplies and other operating needs  commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services  and commitments under a limited number of executive employment agreements 
we excluded long term agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty 
we also have long term liabilities that do not have specified maturity dates 
included in other long term liabilities is million for employee compensation and benefits  most of which will come due beyond five years and million for accrued rent  the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table 
critical accounting policies tjx must evaluate and select applicable accounting policies 
we consider our most critical accounting policies  involving management estimates and judgments  to be those relating to inventory valuation  retirement obligations  casualty insurance  and accounting for taxes 
we believe that we have selected the most appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and that the results we would have obtained  had alternative assumptions been selected  would not be materially different from the results we have reported 
inventory valuation we use the retail method for valuing inventory on a first in first out basis 
under the retail method  the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost to retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory 
this method is widely used in the retail industry and involves management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and inventory shrinkage 
a significant factor involves the recording and timing of permanent markdowns 
under the retail method  permanent markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation when the price of an item is changed 
we believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other accounting methods 
in addition  as a normal business practice  we have a very specific policy as to when markdowns are to be taken  greatly reducing the need for management estimates 
inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods  but is based on a full physical inventory at fiscal year end 
thus  the difference between actual and estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in quarterly results  but is not a factor in full year results 
overall  we believe that the retail method  coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and a full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end  results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated 
lastly  many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions  which ultimately affect the value of the inventory 
our off price businesses have historically not entered into such arrangements with our vendors 
bob s stores  the value oriented retailer we acquired in december  does have vendor relationships that provide for recovery of advertising dollars if certain 
table of contents conditions are met 
these arrangements do have some impact on bob s inventory valuation but such amounts are immaterial to our consolidated results 
retirement obligations retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent in the aggregate obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates 
we are required to make assumptions regarding variables  such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets  both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period 
the discount rate  which we determine annually based on market interest rates  has dropped over the past several years and our actual returns on pension assets for the several years prior to fiscal were considerably less than our expected returns 
these two factors can have a considerable impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and in recent years have had an unfavorable effect on the funded status of our qualified pension plan 
we have made contributions of million  which exceeded the minimum required  over the last three years to largely restore the funded status of our plan 
casualty insurance the nature of our casualty insurance program for certain fiscal periods  primarily fiscal  and  carries a deductible that exposes tjx to losses for casualty claims in excess of our estimated annual cost of such losses 
the accrual for our estimated losses requires us  with the aid of an actuarial service and based upon claims experience of tjx and other factors  to make significant estimates and assumptions 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
a large portion of these losses are funded during the policy year  offsetting our estimated loss accruals 
the company has a net accrual of million for the unfunded portion of its casualty losses as of january  accounting for taxes like many large corporations  we are regularly under audit by the united states federal  state  local or foreign tax authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes 
in evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various tax filing positions  we accrue charges for possible exposures 
based on the annual evaluations of tax positions  we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures 
to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted 
the internal revenue service is currently examining the fiscal years ended january through january and we also have various state and foreign tax examinations in process 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r which requires that the cost of all employee stock options  as well as other equity based compensation arrangements  be reflected in the financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
this statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  our third quarter of fiscal 
we disclose the pro forma impact of expensing stock options in accordance with sfas no 
as originally issued in our notes to the consolidated financial statements and we are still assessing the impact that sfas no 
r will have on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage by requiring these items to be recognized as current period charges 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application permitted 
we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
this statement addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets 
it eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph b of apb and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
this statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have any material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents on january   the fasb released staff position no 
sfas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of which addresses the accounting and disclosure implications that are expected to arise as a result of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act enacted on december  we are in the process of determining if our plan is actuarially equivalent to medicare part d and our disclosed postretirement medical cost of million for fiscal has not been reduced by any federal subsidy 
we do not expect that any subsidy for which we may qualify will be material 
market risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our canadian winners and homesense and european tk maxx operations 
as more fully described in notes a and d to the consolidated financial statements  we hedge a significant portion of our net investment in foreign operations  intercompany transactions with these operations  and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations  with derivative financial instruments 
we utilize currency forward and swap contracts  designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures 
the contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 
we do not enter into derivatives for speculative trading purposes 
in addition  the assets of our qualified pension plan  a large portion of which is invested in equity securities  are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the public stock market 
we allocate the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to these market uncertainties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our canadian winners and homesense and european tk maxx operations 
as more fully described in notes a and d to the consolidated financial statements  we hedge a significant portion of our net investment in foreign operations  intercompany transactions with these operations  and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations  with derivative financial instruments 
we enter into derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure 
we utilize currency forward and swap contracts  designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures 
the contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above 
as of january   the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our cash equivalents and short term investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by the company 
we occasionally enter into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing  however  we believe that the use of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market conditions 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum variable rate debt outstanding during the previous year 
as of january   the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
