there were increases in all product categories except specialty trailers  and average net revenue per unit improved by percent in compared to the average net revenue improvements reflect a more favorable mix of products with higher average prices and the full effect of a percent price increase in may  partially offset by an increase in sales program rebates and discounts in motorcoach segment net sales increased by percent over the same period in as total unit sales increased by percent  with increases of percent and percent in unit sales of new and used motorcoaches  respectively 
the effect of these increases was partially offset by a percent decline in average net revenue per unit sold due to the significant increase in the number of lower price used units sold 
consolidated gross profit margin increased by million to million in from million in this improvement was attributable to increased sales volume in both segments in compared to as a percentage of sales  consolidated gross profit margin for the year of was percent in compared to percent in trailer margin percentages for the current year were percentage points higher than the same period in  primarily the result of manufacturing efficiency improvements due to increased volume  changes in product mix and the further implementation of lean manufacturing processes  which increased the average gross margin per unit sold 
motorcoach gross profit margin increased by percentage points in compared to this increase resulted primarily from improved percentage margins realized on sales of both new and used coaches as well as reduced labor and overhead costs  including the non recurrence in of a loss settlement accrual of  in  as well as an  reduction in write downs on used motorcoaches held in inventory 
consolidated selling and administrative expenses increased by million in  to million  a percent increase  from million in as a percentage of sales  these expenses increased to percent in from percent in trailer segment expenses increased by percent in compared to due primarily to increased marketing related costs related to generating and maintaining higher sales volume as well as increased sales commissions and matching k contributions

the overall effective income tax provision rate was percent in compared to an income tax benefit of percent in the effective rate was lower than the company s combined federal and state corporate tax rate due to the tax benefit of associated with the reversal of the  deferred tax asset valuation allowance recorded in the third quarter due to the improvement of the company s operating results in and its improved outlook for the future 
the low effective income tax benefit rate was primarily a result of the reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance due to a  decrease in net deferred tax assets that resulted in a percent reduction in tax rate 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year the following table summaries changes in the company s consolidated and segment results of operations in millions and as a percentage of net sales for the years and year vs

these decreases were partially offset by a reduction in interest expense and selling costs and by the realization of certain income tax benefits 
consolidated net sales for decreased by million percent to million compared with million in this decrease in primarily reflects an overall decline of percent in unit sales 
sales of specialty trailers and transporters decreased by percent as unit sales declined percent with reductions in all product categories except car hauler and utility trailers 
this decline was partially offset by an increase of percent in average net revenue per unit due to a more favorable mix of products with a higher average price and the affect of percent price increases in both and on most trailer models  partially offset by an increase in sales program rebates and discounts in compared to motorcoach segment sales decreased percent as unit sales declined percent 
this reduction in unit sales was partially offset by a percent increase in the average revenue per unit as there were more higher priced units sold 
unit sales of new motorcoaches decreased by percent as the result of lower sales of less popular xl models and discontinued featherlite vogue models 
unit sales of used coaches also declined percent in part due to fewer trade ins and reduced new unit sales 
consolidated gross profit margin decreased by million to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  consolidated gross profit margin was percent in compared to percent in this overall decline in consolidated gross profit margin reflects the decline in net sales as discussed above  but was also partially attributable to lower percentage margins on trailer sales and reduced percentage margins realized in the motorcoach segment 
trailer margins were percentage points lower in compared to the same period in primarily as a result of increased material costs attributable to changes in product mix  including increased sales of used units  partially offset by reduced labor and overhead costs due to improved efficiencies resulting from changes in sales volume and product mix 
motorcoach gross profit margins decreased by percentage points as lower margins were realized on sales of new and used units as prices were reduced to sell less popular discontinued models and as the result of the following additional charges a provision of million in to reduce the inventory cost of used coaches to estimated market value compared to a similar provision of  in  and a charge of  for the loss on a litigation settlement consolidated selling and administrative expenses increased by  in to million  a percent increase from million in as a percentage of sales  these expenses increased to percent in from percent in  primarily reflecting the reduced sales volume

the effective tax benefit rate reflects a  tax refund percent reduction in rate as a result of the jobs creation and worker assistance act of and a  reduction in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets percent reduction in rate due to a decrease in net deferreds 
outlook we are cautiously optimistic about the rate of sales growth in  although unfilled confirmed order backlog has decreased in both our specialty trailer and motorcoach segments 
at december  the new order backlog for trailers of million is percent below its level of million at december  motorcoach backlog has decreased by to a level of million at december  compared to million at december  these backlogs have continued to decline in the early months of  with trailer backlog at million at february  compared to million at february   and motorcoach backlog of million at february  compared to million at february  we believe the decrease in trailer backlog can be attributed primarily to the heavy buying by dealers in the fourth quarter of in anticipation of a increase in prices as of january  for all trailers invoiced after that date that were not in backlog at december  to offset increased aluminum costs in we believe that the price increase has decreased the new order levels in the early months of as the dealers inventories are being reduced 
management believes the reduction in motorcoach backlog primarily reflects a change in customer buying preferences  ie  buying completed coaches rather than ordering a custom coach for future delivery and does not reflect a reduction in the demand for motorcoaches 
management expects that sales in both business segments will continue to improve if the national economic business conditions improve and consumer uncertainty diminishes 
there is continuing focus by the company on sales and marketing related activities that have been effective in increasing sales in the past  but there is no assurance they will be successful in increasing order levels to maintain or exceed the sales volume or that the price increase initiated as of january  will be sufficient to offset increased aluminum and other cost increases that may be incurred in the company believes its name recognition and close affiliation with the motorsports industry will continue to have a positive impact on its sales of specialty trailers  transporters and luxury motorcoaches 
with more than percent of its revenue from end users in motorsports and leisure and entertainment categories  which also includes horse trailers  and its strong position in the livestock trailer market  the company believes it is strategically well positioned to continue to benefit from these markets 
the company introduced new and enhanced models of trailers in and added motorcoach models with enhanced features 
liquidity and capital resources general the company s liquidity is primarily affected by its cash flow from operations together with changes in amounts available to borrow on its approved lines of credit with us bank and ge 
during the year ended december   the company s operating activities provided net cash of million 
at december   the company had approximately million available to borrow under its credit lines compared to million at december   an increase of million as availability under these both lines increased due to changes in eligible receivables and inventories 
the company s liquidity can be measured by two key indicators  its current ratio and its ratio of debt to shareholders investment 
the company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december   compared with a ratio of at december  this ratio has improved as a result of operating results and cash flow 
the ratio of total debt to shareholders investment decreased to to at december  from to at december  this ratio improved as stockholders investment increased during as a result improved net income for the year 
to maintain an efficient level of trailer production  increased expenditures for working capital items may be required from time to time to support production levels in excess of sales 
a significant increase in trailer backlog beginning in the fourth quarter and through the first two quarters of led to an increase in raw materials and work in process inventories by million 
the production workforce was also expanded proportionally with the increased level of orders 
production levels in excess of new order levels especially during the last two quarters of have resulted in the growth of finished trailer inventories by million 
it is the company s expectation that a substantial portion of these additional trailers will be sold to dealers in the coming months 
however  there is no assurance this will occur  which could adversely impact the liquidity of the company 
at the company s request  u 
s bank increased its asset based revolving credit commitment from million to million in december to provide funding for this inventory growth 
to maintain a level motorcoach production schedule  production may begin on coaches before an order has been received from a specific buyer 
as of december   approximately percent of the coaches in production and to be completed over the next four months have not been sold to specific customers as compared to percent at december  for the year ended december  total units produced exceeded units sold and new coach inventory increased by million 
while it is the company s expectation that substantially all of these motorcoaches will be sold to specific customers  there is no assurance this will occur 
accordingly  this could adversely impact the liquidity of the company 
during the first quarter of  the company has scheduled payments for debt principal and interest  expiring motorcoach shell consignment agreements  management performance bonus payments  k matching contribution payment and other fixed obligations that will require cash flows of million  including million paid to ge due to changes in advance rates on certain coaches on february  additional payments may be required for the commitments and contingencies referred to in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make decisions based upon estimates  assumptions  and factors it considers as relevant to the circumstances 
such decisions include the selection of applicable accounting principles and the use of judgment in their application  the results of which impact reported amounts and disclosures 
changes in economic conditions or other business circumstances may affect the outcomes of management s estimates and assumptions 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those anticipated  and could harm the company s future liquidity 
the company s critical accounting policies that we believe require the most significant estimates and assumptions by management  include the following inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  as determined on a first in  first out fifo basis  or market and includes materials  labor and overhead costs 
raw materials consist of the cost of materials required to produce trailers and complete motorcoach conversions and to support parts sales and service 
work in process consists of costs related to materials  bus conversion shells  labor and overhead related to the production process 
the company writes down its inventory for obsolescence  and the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value 
in the past  the company has recorded significant reductions in the value of its used motorcoach inventory 
inventory write downs are based on assumptions about future sales demand and market conditions 
if actual sales demand or market conditions change from those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from the sale of trailers and motorcoaches when title and risks of ownership are transferred to the customer  which generally is upon shipment or customer pick up 
a customer may be invoiced for and receive title prior to taking physical possession when the customer has made a fixed  written commitment to purchase  the trailer or motorcoach has been completed and is available for pick up or delivery  and the customer has requested the company to hold the trailer or motorcoach until the customer determines the most economical means of taking physical possession 
upon such a request  the company has no further obligation except to segregate the trailer or motorcoach  issue its manufacturer s statement of origin mso  invoice the customer under normal billing and credit terms and hold the trailer or motorcoach and related mso for a short period of time  as is customary in the industry  until pick up or delivery and receipt of payment 
products are built to customer specification and no right of return or exchange privileges are granted 
accordingly  no provision for sales allowances or returns is normally required except in unusual circumstances 
long lived assets management periodically reviews the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying value may not be recoverable 
in performing the review for recoverability  management estimates the non discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
product warranty the company s products are covered by product warranties ranging from one to six years after the date of sale 
at the time of sale  the company recognizes estimated warranty costs based on prior history and expected future claims and records an accrued liability 
the accrued liability is reduced as actual warranty costs are paid and is evaluated periodically to validate previous estimates and known requirements and is adjusted as necessary 
other the company has reserves for other loss exposures  such as litigation  taxes  product liability  worker s compensation  employee medical claims  vacation and accounts receivable 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires use of estimates and judgment in regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability 
the company estimates losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods  however  as better information becomes available or as actual amounts are determinable  the recorded estimates are revised 
ultimate results could differ from these estimates 
item a 
quantitative qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk the company is exposed to market risks related to changes in the cost of aluminum 
aluminum is a commodity that is traded daily on the commodity markets and fluctuates in price 
the average midwest delivered cash price per pound for ingot aluminum during the three years ended december   as reported to the company by its suppliers was in  in  and in the current average aluminum cost per pound for delivery is for the first two months of the company s cost of aluminum  which was approximately percent of consolidated cost of sales in  varies from these market prices due to vendor processing charges  timing of purchases  and contractual commitments with suppliers for specific prices and other factors 
in  the company obtained commitments from suppliers to provide  at an agreed upon fixed price  more than percent of its anticipated requirements for  which reduced substantially the risk of aluminum cost fluctuations for the year 
the company has not yet obtained such commitments for if the company is unable to obtain such commitments from suppliers or otherwise reduce the price risk related to  this could have an adverse impact on the company s operating results if the cost of aluminum increases significantly above levels in and the company cannot increase its product prices sufficiently to cover such increases 
the company initiated a percent price increase for substantially all trailer products other than interior packages that are invoiced after december  unless they were ordered and in backlog at december  management believes this price increase will cover the higher aluminum costs in there is a potential risk of loss related to fixed price contracts if there is a substantial drop in the actual cost of aluminum in relation to the contract price  which would affect the competitive price of the company s products 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to market risks related to changes in us and international interest rates 
approximately million of the company s debt bears interest at a variable rate 
an interest rate increase by one percentage point would reduce the company s future annual net income by approximately  at current debt levels
