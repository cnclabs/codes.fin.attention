critical accounting estimates the company s consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the financial services industry in which it operates 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated by reference in this item 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that require assumptions to be made that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made and where the impact of the selection of the estimate or a change in the estimate from period to period would have a material impact on the financial statements 
based on the potential impact to the financial statements of the valuation methods  estimates  assumptions and judgments used  management identified the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights  the valuation of leased asset residuals and the valuation of pension and postretirement obligations to be the accounting estimates that are the most subjective and or judgmental 
allowance for loan and lease losses the company maintains an allowance in an amount adequate to cover management s estimate of probable credit losses as of a given balance sheet date 
the allowance is based on a range of loss estimates reflecting analyses of individual borrowers and historical loss experience  supplemented as necessary by credit judgment to address observed changes in trends  conditions  and other relevant environmental and economic factors  plus an amount for imprecision 
the general component covers an inevitable imprecise measure relative to quantitative and judgmental estimates 
the determination of the amount of the allowance is a critical accounting estimate as it requires the use of estimates and significant judgment related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated loss rates on homogenous portfolios and deliberation on economic factors and trends 
it is possible that the end of period allowance could have been reduced or increased if the company had judged environmental and economic conditions and other factors and risks to be more or less favorable 
for further discussion on the allowance  see the corporate risk profile allowance for loan and lease losses section of this item 
mortgage servicing rights valuation when mortgage loans are sold with servicing retained  a servicing asset is established and accounted for based on estimated fair values 
such values are determined using discounted cash flow modeling techniques  which require management to make estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows  loan repayment rates  costs to service and interest rates that reflect the risk involved 
because the value of these assets is sensitive to changes in the estimates and assumptions made  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights is considered a critical accounting estimate 
had the company assumed that interest rates would decrease and prepayment rates remain at record high levels as in  then the value of the mortgage servicing rights could have been lower 
note to the consolidated financial statements  which includes further discussion on the accounting for these assets and a sensitivity analysis  is incorporated by reference in this item 
residual valuation of leased assets lease financing receivables include a residual value component  which represents the estimated value of leased assets upon lease expiration 
the valuation of lease residuals is considered a critical accounting estimate due to the subjectivity surrounding the future valuation 
the determination of expected value at lease termination is derived from a variety of sources  including equipment valuation services  appraisals and publicly available market data on recent sales transactions on similar equipment 
the length of time until termination and the cyclical nature of equipment values are important variables considered in making this determination 
the company updates its valuation analysis on an annual basis  or more often when events or circumstances warrant 
when it is determined that a residual value is higher than the expected fair market value at lease expiration  the difference is recorded as an asset impairment 
the company is unable to predict future events or conditions that could result in future asset impairments 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion on the accounting for these assets and is incorporated by reference in this item 
pension and postretirement plans the company s pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic cost are actuarially determined based on the following key assumptions discount rate  estimated future return on plan assets  and the health care cost trend rate 
the discount rate was determined based upon the yield on high quality  fixed income investments and discount rates used by peer groups 
the net periodic cost was determined using a discount rate of and the pension and postretirement obligations at december  were determined using a discount rate of 
the estimated return on plan assets of was based on historical trends and a building block approach taking into account the type of investments in the pension plan 
the health care cost trend rate for was 
historically  the health care cost trend rate experienced by the company has been below 
in  the health care cost trend rate will be and decrease by annually until reaching the ultimate trend rate of in a basis point increase in the discount rate would have decreased the total pension and postretirement net periodic cost in by million and the benefit obligations at december  by million 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the pension and postretirement net periodic cost by million and the benefit obligations by million 
a change in the health care cost trend rate would have changed the net periodic postretirement cost by million 
the estimated pension and postretirement net periodic cost for is million based on a discount rate of 
a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate will decrease or increase  respectively  the total pension and postretirement net periodic cost by million

net servicing income is defined as income earned for servicing loans less the amortization of mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage banking income is highly influenced by the level and direction of mortgage interest rates 
mortgage banking income declined in as compared to largely as a result of a decrease in mortgage loan production 
mortgage interest rates hit record lows in  which led to a record year for production 
the decreased production volume in combined with competitive sales margins and a change in the mix of production to more variable rate loans led to lower gains on sale of loans 
gains from the sale of loans declined million and other fees declined million in from however  the decline in re financings benefited the company as loan prepayments declined by resulting in an increase in net servicing income of

business segments the company s business segments are defined as retail banking  commercial banking  investment services group  and treasury and other corporate 
the management accounting process measures the performance of the business segments based on the management structure of the company and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution 
this process uses various techniques to assign balance sheet and income statement amounts to the business segments  including allocations of overhead  the provision and capital 
this process is dynamic and requires certain allocations based on judgment and subjective factors 
unlike financial accounting  there is no comprehensive  authoritative guidance for management accounting that is equivalent to us generally accepted accounting principles 
results for prior periods have been reclassified to facilitate comparability with the presentation 
the business segments are primarily managed with a focus on performance measures  including net income after capital charge niacc and risk adjusted return on capital raroc 
niacc is net income less a charge for the cost of allocated capital 
the cost of allocated capital is determined by multiplying management s estimate of the shareholder s minimum required rate of return on capital invested currently by the segment s allocated equity 
the company assumes a cost of capital that is equal to a risk free rate plus a risk premium 
raroc is the ratio of net income to risk adjusted equity 
equity is allocated to each business segment based on an assessment of its inherent risk 
the net interest income of the business segments reflects the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics and reflects the allocation of net interest income related to the company s overall asset and liability management activities on a proportionate basis 
the basis for the allocation of net interest income is a function of management decisions and assumptions that are subject to change based on changes in current interest rate and market conditions 
the provision charged to the treasury and other corporate segment represents changes in the level of the allowance 
the provision recorded in the retail banking  commercial banking and investment services group segments represents actual net charge offs of these segments 
on a consolidated basis  the company considers niacc a measure of shareholder value creation 
for the year ended december   consolidated niacc was million  compared to million in  a result of improved financial performance and more efficient use of capital 
financial results for each of the segments are presented in table and note of the consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated by reference in this item

during  the segment experienced steady growth in its indirect auto  direct personal and home equity portfolios  partially offsetting the effect of the lower earnings credit on deposit accounts 
the decrease in non interest income primarily resulted from lower gains on the sale of mortgage loans due to lower production and related sales volume and competitive market conditions 
the segment s decrease in non interest expense was primarily due to reductions in technology and operations support  depreciation and software costs attributable to the systems replacement project 
the increase in the provision was primarily due to increased charge offs in the segment s growing loan portfolios 
the improvement in the segment s financial measures in as compared to was primarily due to an increase in net interest income as well as a decrease in non interest expense and systems replacement project costs 
these positive trends were partially offset by an increase in the provision 
the increase in net interest income for the segment was reflective of higher average loan balances  largely a result of strong growth in the segment s auto  direct personal  small business and home equity portfolios  augmented by a purchase of home equity loans in december also contributing to the increase in net interest income was lower interest expense on deposit accounts  reflective of the lower interest rate environment in the decrease in non interest expense was primarily due to reductions in technology support  depreciation and advertising costs

the increase in non interest income is a result of a gain on the sale of assets at the end of a leveraged lease transaction  a leasing partnership investment distribution and increased insurance income 
this was offset by a decrease in net interest income due to a decrease in the earnings credit from funds transfer pricing on the segment s deposit account balances reflective of lower interest rates 
total non interest expense declined in from because of decreases in salaries and lower allocated expenses from support units within the company 
the charge for capital decreased because of the refinement of credit risk factors 
the improvement in the segment s financial measures for compared to was a result of a decrease in non interest expense and an increase in non interest income  moderately offset by lower net interest income 
the increase in non interest income was attributable to an increase in prepayment fees on commercial real estate loans  insurance income and other fees 
the decline in non interest expense was due to cost management initiatives that reduced staffing levels and other direct expenses as well as the realization of benefits from the system replacement project  and reduced allocated expenses from support units within the company 
investment services group the investment services group includes private banking  trust services  asset management  and institutional investment advice 
a significant portion of this segment s income is derived from fees  which are generally based on the market values of assets under administration 
the private banking and personal trust group assists individuals and families in building and preserving their wealth by providing investment  credit and trust expertise to high net worth individuals 
the asset management group manages portfolios and creates investment products 
institutional sales and service offers investment advice to corporations  government entities and foundations

the increase in non interest expense was primarily due to increased professional fees relating to the company s mutual funds 
the decline in the segment s financial measures for as compared to was primarily due to a decrease in non interest income 
non interest bearing deposit balances decreased  resulting in a decline in net interest income

expenses incurred by these support units are charged to the business segments through an internal cost allocation process 
results for this segment in and include the system replacement project costs that were not incurred by or allocated to the other business segments and the residual costs associated with restructuring activities 
the improvement in the segment s financial measures in compared to was primarily due to an increase in net interest income and the absence of system replacement project costs 
the increase in net interest income was due to the impact of the lower cost of funding deposits by the treasury unit and higher average balances in the investment portfolio 
niacc was also favorably impacted by a lower capital charge due to the reduction of the company s excess capital as a result of the continuing share repurchase activity 
the improvement in the segment s financial measures in compared to was primarily due to a significant decline in the capital charge 
continued share repurchase activity had led to the reduction of excess capital  thereby lowering the related charge for capital 
partially offsetting the positive impact of the reduction of excess capital was an increase in expenses for the systems replacement project and other non interest expenses not allocated to the other business segments 
in  results for this segment included restructuring related costs resulting from branch closures in the pacific islands and the completion of the divestitures 
the negative amount in the provision reflects the overall reduction in the allowance

foreign activities during  the company continued to hold us dollar placements and securities issued by foreign entities  as a tax efficient investment structure to generate foreign source earnings 
the company has foreign tax credits available to reduce the tax rate on this income 
the company s foreign lending included both local currency and cross border lending 
local currency loans are those that are funded and will be repaid in the currency of the borrower s country 
cross border lending  on the other hand  involves loans that will be repaid in a currency other than that of the borrower s country 
this type of lending involves greater risk because the borrower s ability to repay is additionally dependent on changes in the currency exchange rate 
credit limits have been established for each country 
these credit limits are monitored and reviewed on a regular basis

corporate risk profile credit risk credit risk is defined as the risk that borrowers or counter parties will not be able to repay their obligations to the company 
credit exposures reflect legally binding commitments for loans  leases  banker s acceptances  financial and standby letters of credit and overnight overdrafts 
the company s asset quality continued to improve in as evidenced by lower levels of internally criticized loans  non performing assets and a continued lower trend in the level of net charge offs 
the ratio of non performing assets to total loans and foreclosed real estate was at december  as compared to at december  as a percentage of average loans  net charge offs were as compared to for the company s improved credit risk profile relative to a year ago reflects sustained expansion and strength in the hawaii and mainland economies with disciplined underwriting and portfolio management 
the quality of the portfolio of hawaii based loans continued to improve  primarily due to the expanding local economy led by construction and real estate industries and record levels of domestic tourism 
strong credit quality in the mainland portfolio reflected prior years strategy of shifting to borrowers and industries believed to have a lower risk profile and targeted reductions in large borrower concentrations 
in addition  ongoing portfolio management results in early identification and disengagement  when possible  from weakening credits 
in the consumer portfolios  performance was satisfactory despite higher net charge offs as a result of seasoning in hawaii and reduced collections in american samoa 
residential real estate continued to be supported by a strong housing market

in the guam portfolio  which is sensitive to tourism and military spending  economic indicators trended upward in although some uncertainty continued to exist 
tourism had rebounded and there have been announced increases in military spending and presence 
as of december   internally classified exposure declined from december  due to strategic reduction along with some borrower improvement 
targeted lending to select commercial borrowers is active  while consumer loans are leading portfolio growth 
total syndicated exposure of million at december  decreased million or from the decrease reflected disengagements and pay offs in the printing publishing and the hotel industries 
at december   the largest syndicated loan outstanding totaled million to a hawaii shopping center operator while the second largest was million to a hawaii based hotel operator 
the largest syndicated credits had outstandings totaling million down from million as of december  of the top exposures  reflected loans to hawaii based borrowers  primarily real estate investors developers 
of the total syndicated exposure as of december   a million undrawn syndicated letter of credit was internally classified  representing less than of total syndicated unfunded commitments 
the letter of credit exposure was to an airline operating under chapter bankruptcy and is cash secured 
the company s other large concentrations at december  included five exposures larger than million 
the borrowers are major companies  of which three have hawaii operations 
three exposures that totaled million or of the total were commercial paper backup lines to investment grade companies and were undrawn 
the remaining two exposures were collateralized by securities and real estate and were substantially funded

non performing assets non performing assets npas consist of non accrual loans and loans held for sale and foreclosed real estate 
the net decrease in npas at december  from december  included million of loans that returned to accrual status  million of payments and pay offs and million of charge offs 
the decrease in non performing assets in also included a million transfer of a company occupied foreclosed real estate property to premises 
against a backdrop of improving economic conditions and positive resolution of several borrowers  additions to npas of million decreased million from the prior year level  charge offs from npas of million decreased million  and payments of million increased million 
total additions also included million of residential real estate that had predominantly paid off as of december  at december   the ratio of non performing assets to total loans and foreclosed real estate was  a decline from at december  as of december   of total npas were concentrated in commercial loans in commercial mortgage and were secured by residential mortgage 
this compares to the prior year concentrations of in commercial loans in commercial mortgage and secured by residential mortgage 
npas in guam were reduced nearly to million from million in primarily due to payments from a number of commercial borrowers 
as a percentage of total npas  guam exposure represented in  a decline from in loans past due days or more and still accruing interest accruing loans past due days or more totaled million at december   a decrease of million or from december  the decrease generally reflected improvement in residential mortgages in guam and hawaii  due to improving economic conditions in guam and a solid economy and strong housing market in hawaii

the allowance is based on a range of inherent loss estimates derived from a comprehensive quarterly analysis of historical loss experience  plus an amount for credit management judgment reflecting the evaluation of the impact of environmental factors on portfolio performance  plus an amount for imprecision of estimates 
note to the consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated by reference in this item  describes the methodologies used to develop the allowance 
the allowance was million at december   a decrease of million from december  based on continued strength in the economic environment  improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio  lower than anticipated net charge offs during and management s ongoing assessment of the portfolio  the company returned million to income from a release of the allowance in in addition  million was reclassified to other liabilities from the allowance relating to the allowance for unfunded commitments discussed in more detail in the next section 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated by reference in this item  for changes in the allowance during the last five years 
the ratio of the allowance to total loans and leases outstanding was at december  down from at september  and down from at december  if the allowance for unfunded commitments had been reclassified at either september  or december   the ratio of the allowance losses to total loans and leases outstanding would have been and  respectively 
net charge offs for of million or of total average loans  decreased from million or of total average loans in net charge offs in included recoveries of million from divested businesses and net charge offs included million of charge offs for the remaining portfolio balances of certain pacific island locations where operations were previously discontinued 
adjusted for activity from these divested or discontinued operations  net charge offs for of million or of total average loans  increased from million or of total average loans in this increase was in other consumer loans  driven by seasoning in organic growth in hawaii and reduced collections in american samoa 
beginning with the fourth quarter  the company revised its allocation of the components of the allowance as a result of current accounting interpretations 
specific risk factors previously considered and included in the general component have been allocated to the credit judgment segment in order to present total reserve allocations for a given risk element 
the general component now provides solely for imprecision in the company s process for estimating probable loss inherent in the portfolio 
while management has allocated a portion of the allowance to specific loan categories  the adequacy of the allowance must be considered in its entirety 
the allowance is considered adequate by management at december   based on an ongoing analysis of estimated probable credit losses  credit risk profiles  economic conditions  coverage ratios and other relevant factors

unfunded commitments to extend credit reflect bankers acceptances  financial and standby letters of credit  commercial letters of credit  overnight overdrafts  and credit cards where the company has issued a loss guarantee on behalf of its customers 
the process used to determine the allowance for unfunded commitments remains consistent with the process for determining the allowance as adjusted for estimated funding probabilities or loan equivalency factors 
the allowance for unfunded commitments at december  was million 
market risk market risk is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices 
the company is exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting its business activities 
financial products that expose the company to market risk include investment securities  loans  deposits  debt and derivative financial instruments 
the company s market risk management process involves measuring  monitoring  controlling and managing risks that can significantly impact the company s financial position and operating results 
in this management process  market risks are balanced with expected returns in an effort to enhance earnings performance and shareholder value  while limiting the volatility of each 
the activities associated with these market risks are categorized into trading and other than trading 
the company s trading activities include foreign currency and foreign exchange contracts that expose the company to a minor degree of foreign currency risk 
these transactions are primarily executed on behalf of customers and at times for the company s own account 
the company s other than trading activities include normal business transactions that expose the company s balance sheet profile to varying degrees of market risk 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
a key element in the process of managing market risk involves oversight by senior management and the board of directors as to the level of such risk assumed by the company in its balance sheet 
the board of directors reviews and approves risk management policies  including risk limits and guidelines and delegates oversight functions to the asset liability management committee alco 
the alco  consisting of senior business and finance officers  monitors the company s market risk exposure and  as market conditions dictate  modifies balance sheet positions 
the alco may also direct the use of derivative instruments 
interest rate risk the company s balance sheet is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
this interest rate risk arises primarily from the company s normal business activities of making loans and taking deposits 
many other factors also affect the company s exposure to changes in interest rates  such as general economic and financial conditions  customer preferences  and historical pricing relationships 
the earnings of the company and the bank are affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states and its agencies  particularly the federal reserve system 
the monetary policies of the federal reserve system influence to a significant extent the overall growth of loans  investments and deposits  the level of interest rates earned on assets and paid for liabilities  and interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies are generally not predictable 
a key element in the company s ongoing process to measure and monitor interest rate risk is the utilization of a net interest income nii simulation model 
this model is used to estimate the amount that nii will change over a one year time horizon under various interest rate scenarios 
these estimates are based on assumptions on the behavior of loan and deposit pricing  prepayment speeds on mortgage related assets  and principal amortization and maturities on other financial instruments 
the model s analytics includes the effects of embedded options 
while such assumptions are inherently uncertain  management believes that these assumptions are reasonable 
as a result  the nii simulation model captures the dynamic nature of the balance sheet and provides a sophisticated estimate rather than a precise prediction of nii s exposure to higher or lower interest rates 
table presents  as of december   and  the estimate of the change in nii from a gradual basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  moving in parallel fashion for the entire yield curve  over the next month period relative to the measured base case scenario for nii 
market risk exposure to interest rate changes table december  interest rate change in basis points interest rate change in basis points interest rate change in basis points dollars in thousands estimated exposure as a percent of net interest income estimated exposure to net interest income   to enhance and complement the results from the nii simulation model  the company also reviews other measures of interest rate risk 
these measures include the sensitivity of market value of equity and the exposure to basis risk and non parallel yield curve shifts 
there are inherent limitations to these measures however  used along with the nii simulation model the company obtains better overall insight for managing its exposure to changes in interest rates 
in managing interest rate risks  the company uses several approaches to modify its risk position 
approaches that are used to shift balance sheet mix or alter the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities include changing product pricing strategies  modifying investment portfolio characteristics  or using financial derivative instruments 
the use of financial derivatives  as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated by reference in this item  has been limited over the past several years 
liquidity management liquidity is managed in an effort to ensure that the company has continuous access to sufficient  reasonably priced funding 
funding requirements are impacted by loan refinancings and originations  liability settlements and issuances and off balance sheet funding commitments 
the company considers and complies with various regulatory guidelines regarding required liquidity levels and periodically monitors its liquidity position in light of the changing economic environment and customer activity 
based on periodic liquidity assessments  the company may alter its assets  liabilities and off balance sheet positions 
the company s alco monitors sources and uses of funds and modifies asset and liability positions as liquidity requirements change 
this process  combined with the company s ability to raise funds in money and capital markets and through private placements  provides flexibility in managing the exposure to liquidity risk 
in an effort to ensure that its liquidity needs are met  the company actively manages both the asset and liability sides of the statement of condition 
the primary sources of liquidity are available for sale investment securities  interest bearing deposits and cash flows from loans and investments  as well as the ability to sell or securitize certain assets 
with respect to liabilities  liquidity is generated through growth in deposits  repos and other funding 
during  the company continued to use funds to repurchase stock see capital management and reduce debt where possible 
in  a total of million in privately placed notes matured and only million was replaced by an advance from the federal home loan bank 
in addition  excess liquidity was deployed into longer term assets 
off balance sheet arrangements  commitments and aggregate contractual obligations the company does not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
as of december   the company was not involved in any material unconsolidated spe transactions 
the company s commitments and contractual obligations as of december  are summarized in table see the following notes to the consolidated financial statements which are incorporated by reference in this item for additional information

the company issues commercial paper in various denominations with maturities of generally days or less 
repos are financing transactions  under which securities are pledged as collateral for short term borrowings 
these transactions are normally with governmental entities 
historically  these governmental entities have provided a stable source of funds 
the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank of seattle the fhlb  which provides an additional source for short and long term funding 
borrowings from the fhlb were million and million at the end of and  respectively 
additionally  the bank maintains a billion senior and subordinated bank note program 
under this facility  the bank may issue additional notes provided that the aggregate amount outstanding does not exceed billion 
subordinated notes outstanding under this bank note program totaled million and million at the end of and  respectively 
the largest purchase obligation included in the above table is an outsourcing agreement for technology services 
total payments over the remaining term through of this contract will be approximately million 
other contracts included in purchase obligations consist of service agreements for the company s asset management system  atm system and cash management system 
capital management the company and the bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can cause certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative and qualitative measures 
these measures were established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy 
at december  and  the company and the bank were well capitalized under this regulatory framework 
there have been no conditions or events since december  that management believes have changed either the company s or the bank s capital classifications 
note to the consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated by reference in this item  provides additional information about the regulatory capital framework and the company s capital amounts and ratios 
as of december   million of the capital securities that mature in were outstanding 
these securities qualify as tier i capital for regulatory accounting purposes  but are classified as long term debt in the consolidated statements of condition 
in addition  the company had subordinated debt of million at the end of that qualifies as total capital for regulatory purposes 
at year end  the company s shareholders equity was million  an increase of million or from year end the increase in shareholders equity resulted from current year earnings of million and stock issuances  and the related tax effect  under various stock based employee benefit plans which totaled million 
these increases were partially offset by stock repurchases that totaled million and dividends paid of million 
table presents a five year history of activities and balances in the company s capital accounts  along with key capital ratios

in january  an additional million authorization was approved 
these authorizations  combined with the company s previously announced authorization of  million  brings the total authorized repurchase amount to  million 
from the beginning of the share repurchase program in july through december   the company had repurchased a total of million shares and returned a total of  million to its shareholders at an average cost of per share

the return on average assets for the fourth quarter of improved to from in the comparable period in return on average equity for the fourth quarter of improved to from in the same quarter last year 
net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis for the fourth quarter of increased million or from the fourth quarter of as a result of higher yields on investment securities 
the net interest margin was for the fourth quarter of  a five basis point increase from in the same prior year quarter 
the net interest margin improvement from the prior year quarter was a result of increased earning assets  mainly investment securities 
due to continued strength in the economic environment  improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio  lower than anticipated net charge offs during and management s ongoing assessment of the portfolio  the company returned million to income from a release of the allowance million or per diluted share after taxes 
non interest income was million for the fourth quarter  a decrease of million or from the same period in the decrease was largely due to declines in gains on sales of mortgage loans 
non interest expense for the fourth quarter of was million  a decrease of million or from the comparable period in the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in salaries and benefits related to incentive compensation and separation expenses 
in addition  the fourth quarter of included higher stock based compensation expense that was offset by a curtailment gain on post retirement benefits 
during the fourth quarter of  the company repurchased million shares of common stock at a total cost of million under its share repurchase program

outlook the company currently estimates that its net income for should be approximately million to million 
an important element in the estimation process is the appropriate level of the allowance 
an analysis of credit quality is performed quarterly to determine the adequacy of the allowance 
the results of this analysis determine the timing and amount of the provision 
in addition  based on current economic conditions  the company expects that further credit quality improvement may occur and  as a result  the allowance may be further reduced 
accordingly  the net income estimates include a million provision for this provision estimate results in a million change in pretax income from  which included a return of million to income from a release of the allowance 
earnings per share and return on equity projections continue to be dependent upon  among other things  the terms and timing of share repurchases
