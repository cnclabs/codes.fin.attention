item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion reviews our operations for each of the three years in the period ended december   and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements 
the accuracy of such statements depends upon a variety of factors that may affect our business and operations 
certain of these factors are discussed under description of business factors influencing future results and accuracy of forward looking statements included in item of this report 
summary of critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the company s financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company s critical accounting policies are described below 
revenue recognition revenues from the company s car and truck wash segment are recognized  net of customer coupon discounts  when services are rendered or fuel or merchandise is sold 
the company records a liability for gift certificates  ticket books  and seasonal and annual passes sold at its car care locations but not yet redeemed 
the company estimates these unredeemed amounts based on gift certificate and ticket book sales and redemptions throughout the year as well as utilizing historical sales and tracking of redemption rates per the car washes point of sale systems 
seasonal and annual passes are amortized on a straight line basis over the time during which the passes are valid 
revenues from the company s security segment are recognized when shipments are made  or for export sales when title has passed 
shipping and handling charges billed are included in revenues  the cost of which is included in sg a expenses 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used  and assets to be disposed of  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
if significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable  we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows 
cash flow projections are sometimes based on a group of assets  rather than a single asset 
if cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset  we determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows 
if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows  we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset group to its carrying value 
if the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group  an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding impairment charges incurred with respect to our truck wash operations 

table of contents goodwill in accordance with sfas  the company completed annual impairment tests as of november    and  and will be subject to an impairment test each year thereafter and whenever there is an impairment indicator 
the company s annual impairment testing corresponds with the company s determination of its annual operating budgets for the upcoming year 
the company s valuation of goodwill is based on a discounted cash flow model applying an appropriate discount rate to future expected cash flows and management s annual review of historical data and future assessment of certain critical operating factors  including  car wash volumes  average car wash and detailing revenue rates per car  wash and detailing labor cost percentages  weather trends and recent and expected operating cost levels 
estimating cash flows requires significant judgment including factors beyond our control and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized 
weather  particularly in our northeast and texas regions  continues to negatively influence our operating results 
this negative influence continues to affect our future cash flow assumptions during our annual goodwill impairment testing resulting in further goodwill impairment charges in as part of our november  annual testing 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding impairment charges incurred with respect to our northeast and texas reporting units 
adverse business conditions could affect recoverability of goodwill in the future and accordingly  the company may record additional impairments in subsequent years 
other intangible assets other intangible assets consist primarily of deferred financing costs  customer lists  product lists  trademarks  and a registered national brand name 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  our trademarks and brand name are considered to have indefinite lives  and as such  are not subject to amortization 
these assets are tested for impairment using discounted cash flow methodology annually and whenever there is an impairment indicator 
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized 
several impairment indicators are beyond our control  and cannot be predicted with any certainty whether or not they will occur 
deferred financing costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective debt instruments 
customer lists  product lists  and non compete agreements are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective estimated useful lives 
income taxes deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred income tax expense benefit represents the change during the period in the deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities 
deferred income tax assets include tax loss and credit carryforwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
supplementary cash flow information interest paid on all indebtedness was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and respectively 
income taxes paid were approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively

costs of terminated acquisitions our policy is to charge as an expense any previously capitalized expenditures relating to proposed acquisitions that in our current opinion will not be consummated 
at december   there were no capitalized costs related directly to proposed acquisitions that were not yet consummated 
we periodically review the future likelihood of these acquisitions and record appropriate provisions against capitalized costs associated with projects that are not likely to be completed 

table of contents goodwill and asset impairment charges in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used  and assets to be disposed of  for possible impairment when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
during the year ended december   we wrote down assets determined to be impaired by approximately million 
the asset write down related to one of our full service car wash sites in texas and two full service car wash sites in arizona 
we have determined that due to changing demographics and increased competition in the geographic areas of these sites  their future expected cash flows will not be sufficient to recover their respective carrying values 
during the quarter ended june   we further wrote down the assets related to one of the full service car wash sites in arizona  which we partially wrote down at december   by an additional  the additional write down was the result of the impending loss of a significant customer of this site resulting in an additional reduction of the future expected cash flows of this site and the ability to recover the site s carrying value 
we closed the facility effective september  during the quarter ended june   we sold the other arizona car wash site recording a loss of  on the disposition 
we continue to market the texas site for sale and have written down these assets to their estimated fair market values 
additionally  during the year ended december   we wrote down assets related to our truck wash operations determined to be impaired by approximately  we have determined that due to a reduction in truck wash volumes resulting from an increase in inclement weather  increased competition  the significant increase in fuel costs which had the effect of reducing spending on truck washing  and demographic changes to certain of our facilities  their future expected cash flows would not be sufficient to recover their respective carrying values 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we perform the annual impairment testing of goodwill and other intangibles as of november each year which corresponds with the company s determination of its annual operating budgets for the upcoming year 
our valuation of goodwill is based on a discounted cash flow model applying an appropriate discount rate to future expected cash flows and management s annual review of historical data and future assessment of certain critical operating factors  including  car wash volumes  average car wash and detailing revenue rates per car  wash and detailing labor cost percentages  weather trends and recent and expected operating cost levels 
in the fourth quarter of  as a result of the annual impairment test of goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with sfas  we recorded an impairment of approximately million related to our northeast region reporting unit of our car and truck wash segment 
this was principally due to a reduction in future projected cash flow as determined during our budgeting process  which we undertook in november  the projection of cash flow from the northeast region reporting unit was reduced because fewer cars were washed in than we had projected in november for we projected our car wash volume for based on the number of cars washed in the northeast region reporting unit in the previous four years 
we believe that fewer cars were actually washed during as a result of more inclement weather than in and a slower economy 
in the fourth quarter of  as a result of the annual impairment test of goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with sfas  we recorded an impairment of approximately million related to our northeast region reporting unit of our car and truck wash segment 
additionally  we recorded an impairment of approximately million related to our texas region reporting unit of our car and truck wash segment 
these impairments were principally due to reductions in future projected cash flows as determined during our budgeting process  which we completed in december  the projections of cash flows from these reporting units were reduced because of two successive years of reductions in number of cars washed

we believe that fewer cars were actually washed during as a result of more inclement weather than in  and increased competition near certain of our facilities in texas and new jersey 
in  the income tax benefit related to the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was recorded at an effective tax rate of for the impairments in the arizona and truck wash reporting units 
in  the income tax benefit related to the texas region s goodwill impairment was recorded at an effective tax rate of 
no income tax benefit was recorded for the northeast region reporting unit s impairment due to the non deductibility of the goodwill

our business requires a substantial amount of capital  most notably to pursue our expansion strategies  including our current expansion in the security segment  and for equipment purchases and upgrades for our car and truck wash segment 
we plan to meet these capital needs from various financing sources  including borrowings  internally generated funds  and the issuance of common stock if the market price of the company s stock is at a desirable level 
as of december   we had working capital of approximately million 
at december   working capital was 
table of contents approximately  the significant improvement in working capital at december  is primarily attributable to million of proceeds received from the removal of a restriction on outstanding shares of the company s common stock  million of proceeds  net of issuance costs  from the sale of approximately million shares of the company s common stock to two private institutions through three seperate sale transactions and the sale of  shares of the company s stock to fusion under a master facility agreement  million of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options  and  of proceeds from the sale of an exterior only car wash in new jersey and a full service car wash in arizona 
working capital was also positively affected by the renewal and reclassification to non current liabilities of approximately million of year amortizing loans with bank one 
the increase in working capital was partially offset by the use of million of cash for the acquisitions of ivs and s m on july   capital expenditure investments for further growth within the car and truck wash segment and the security segment  as more fully detailed below  and the reclassification to current liabilities of an additional loan for  which is up for renewal in april the company intends to renew this loan with the current lender 
although the company has been successful in renewing similar loans with the current lender in the past  including the renewal of loans in and totaling million and million  respectively  there can be no assurance that our lender will continue to provide us with renewals or with renewals at favorable terms 
during the year ending december  and  we made capital expenditures of million and  respectively  within our car and truck wash segment 
we estimate aggregate capital expenditures for our car and truck wash segment  exclusive of acquisitions of businesses  of approximately million for the year ending december  the company believes its current cash balance at december  of million and cash flow from operating activities in the remainder of will be sufficient to meet its car wash capital expenditure funding needs through at least the next twelve months 
in years subsequent to  we estimate that our car and truck wash segment will require annual capital expenditures of  to million 
capital expenditures within our car and truck wash segment are necessary to maintain the efficiency and competitiveness of our sites 
if the cash provided from operating activities does not improve in and future years and if current cash balances are depleted  we will need to raise additional capital to meet these ongoing capital requirements 
we have spent approximately million through june  in developing our video surveillance systems operations in ft 
lauderdale  fl 
including the acquisition costs of micro tech and vernex and the cost of developing and purchasing inventory for our expanded product line 
additionally  on july  the company paid approximately million of cash for the acquisition of the s m and ivs security operations 
we also made capital expenditures of approximately million for the purchase and furnishing of a new facility in farmers branch  texas for our newly acquired s m and ivs security operations 
approximately  of the farmers branch  texas facility purchase price was financed 
we estimate capital expenditures for the security segment at approximately  for  principally related to improvements and equipment for the new facilities in farmers branch  texas and ft 
lauderdale  florida 
we intend to continue to expend significant cash for the purchasing of inventory as we grow and introduce new video surveillance products in and in years subsequent to we anticipate that inventory purchases will be funded from cash collected from sales and working capital 
at december   we maintained an unused  revolving credit facility with bank one to provide financing for additional video surveillance product inventory purchases 
this revolving credit facility is subject to an availability calculation based on inventory and accounts receivable as defined in our bank agreement 
based upon availability calculations at december   the full amount of the revolving credit facility is currently available 
the amount of capital that we will spend in and in years subsequent to is largely dependent on the marketing success we achieve with our video surveillance systems and components 
we believe our cash balance of million at december  and the revolving credit facility will provide for growth in unless our operating cash flow improves  our growth will be limited if we deplete our cash balance 
in the past  we have been successful in obtaining financing by selling common stock and obtaining mortgage loans 
our ability to obtain new financing can be adversely impacted by our stock price 
our failure to maintain the required current debt service coverage ratios on existing loans also adversely impacts our ability to obtain additional financing 
we are reluctant to sell common stock at market prices below our per share book value 
for the twelve month period ended december  we would have been in default on certain of our debt covenants had we not obtained waivers 
our ability to obtain new financing will be limited if our stock price is not above our per share book value and our cash from operating activities does not improve 
currently  we cannot incur additional long term debt without the approval of one of our commercial lenders 
the company must demonstrate that the cash flow benefit from the use of new loan proceeds exceeds the resulting future debt service requirements 
debt capitalization and other financing arrangements at december   we had borrowings  including capital lease obligations  of approximately million 
we had three letters 
table of contents of credit outstanding at december   totaling  as collateral relating to workers compensation insurance policies 
we maintain a  revolving credit facility  subject to an availability calculation based on inventory and accounts receivable  to provide financing for additional video surveillance product inventory purchases 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december  the company also maintains a  line of credit for commerical letters of credit for the importation of inventory 
there were no outstanding commerical letters of credit under this commitment at december  several of our debt agreements  as amended  contain certain affirmative and negative covenants and require the maintenance of certain levels of tangible net worth  maintenance of certain unencumbered cash and marketable securities balances  limitations on capital spending and the maintenance of certain debt service coverage ratios on a consolidated level 
at december   we were not in compliance with our semi annual consolidated debt coverage ratio of at least related to our gmac notes payable 
the company s debt coverage ratio related to the gmac notes payable was 
at december  gmac granted us a waiver of acceleration related to the non compliance with the debt coverage ratio covenant at december   and for measurement periods through january  and  accordingly  a portion of the gmac notes payable was reflected as non current on our financial statements at december  if we are not able to increase our debt coverage ratio to at least  or we cannot obtain further waivers of acceleration  the gmac notes may be reflected as current in future balance sheets and as a result our stock price may decline 
the company has entered into amendments to the bank one term loan agreements effective march  the amended debt coverage ratio with bank one requires the company to maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization to debt service of at december  and thereafter 
the company s debt coverage ratio was 
at december   which was not in compliance with this bank one covenant as amended

seasonality and inflation the company believes that its car washing and detailing operations are adversely affected by periods of inclement weather 
in particular  long periods of rain and cloudy weather adversely affects our car wash volumes and related lube and other automotive services as people typically do not wash their cars during such periods 
additionally  extended periods of warm  dry weather  usually encountered during the company s third quarter  may encourage customers to wash their cars themselves which also can adversely affect our car wash business 
the company has attempted to mitigate the risk of unfavorable weather patterns by having operations in diverse geographic regions 
the company also experiences a seasonal reduction in volume during the third quarter within the company s arizona and florida regions as a result of a migration of a significant portion of those areas populations to cooler climates 
the company believes that inflation and changing prices have not had  and are not expected to have  a material adverse effect on its results of operations in the near future
