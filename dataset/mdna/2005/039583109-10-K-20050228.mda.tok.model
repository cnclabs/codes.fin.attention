archstone smith accelerated the implementation of mri  a web based  customer centric property management system that automates virtually all of our daily on site leasing and reporting tasks 
developed with our input by intuit real estate solutions nasdaq intu  mri allows our site teams to better track customer service requests  manage customer records and execute leases more efficiently which we believe enhances our customers experience with us

customer focused operations we believe that our long term cash flow growth is enhanced by the archstone and charles e 
smith brands  our efficient operating platform  robust and scalable technology  and continued investment in our associates 
powerful brands 
an essential component of our strategy is to consistently offer a higher level of service at our apartment communities 
through our seal of service  tm we offer our residents convenience and flexibility all backed by written guarantees 
the seal of service tm helps to create customer loyalty and trust  and increase the likelihood of renewals and referrals 
core process standardization 
we believe that we can create a distinct competitive advantage by identifying and implementing the best practices for our most critical processes and standardizing them at each of our communities 
to do this  we assembled a core process project cpp team to focus on three important customer touch points i customer inquiries and leasing  ii the move in experience  and iii renewal  transfer or move out 
to capture best practices  the cpp team conducts extensive field research with front 
table of contents line associates to translate proven tactics into scalable tools that ensure consistency in our day to day customer interactions 
in  the cpp team rolled out leasing call excellence  a call coaching program that dramatically improves our phone interactions with customers 
the cpp team began the roll out of the move in tracker  a system that standardizes the various tasks needed to prepare for new residents and ensure consistent  defect free move ins across our portfolio 
we believe that by enhancing our customers experiences with us at these critical touch points  we will ultimately increase customer acquisition  retention and referrals 
investing in technology 
we invest in technology to improve our core operations and make it easier for our customers to do business with us 
in  we accelerated the roll out of mri  our web based property management system 
as of february   mri was operational in communities  with a full roll out expected by mid mri provides a seamless online interface with our customers via resident only web sites  allowing customers access to us to complete new leases  pay rent online  submit service requests and more 
online rent payment went live in january  by the end of the year  we had collected a total of million in online rent payments including approximately million in december indicating accelerating usage of the product 
since may  when online lease was rolled out  we have executed nearly online leases 
these resident web sites and the online leasing and rent payment functionality are expected to be fully rolled out across our portfolio by july in addition  mri s automated work order solution improves our ability to manage and execute service requests  one of our most important customer relations functions 
equally important  the system gives us the ability to accurately track resident histories to better understand and serve our customers 
investing in our associates 
a critical component to ensuring the integrity of our brand offering is attracting  training and retaining the best professionals in our industry and giving them the support and tools to provide an exceptional customer experience 
through our training community program  new community associates spend two to four days at a designated training community one that exemplifies excellence in operations and customer service in their market 
new associates are teamed with a training ambassador  a community based associate in a comparable position  to learn our processes first hand before they begin interacting with customers on their own 
over the past year  we have added full time training ambassadors in our core markets 
these full time ambassadors are dedicated to training new associates and providing critical one on one follow up after days of employment for additional training support 
we believe that this hands on training better prepares new associates to deliver on our brand promises and create a consistent and positive customer experience 
in addition to the training community and training ambassador programs  each of our community management and leasing associates receives extensive training in their first year through our customer centered sales excellence ccse training program 
ccse s seven training modules cover the various aspects of our sales process and are offered to associates in manageable half day classes 
we are also dedicated to ongoing training for each of our associates 
in  we expanded the practice of leadership  our feedback based training program  from operations and regional service managers to include corporate managers and non operations functions  giving them the tools to become better leaders 
this three day program focuses on six leadership practices consistent with our company culture and values that we believe drive our success 
this program is complemented by a feedback component  through which direct reports and peers evaluate corporate managers to identify strengths and opportunities for improvement 
community and service managers attend a comparable day program  leading teams at archstone smith  where they learn and practice applying ideas  techniques and tools to enhance their effectiveness as team leaders 
approximately community  service and corporate managers attended the program in 
table of contents investment strategy protected markets 
we invest our capital in protected markets  where there is a very limited amount of land on which new housing can be developed  which minimizes new competition 
in addition to supply constraints  our core markets are characterized by very expensive single family home prices and a strong  diversified economic base with employment growth potential  which we believe maximizes our ability to maintain occupancy and produce sustainable long term cash flow growth 
capital recycling program 
we utilize a successful capital allocation strategy  using the selective sale of non core assets to redeploy disposition proceeds into investments with higher anticipated long term growth prospects 
we believe that concentrating our portfolio in protected markets improves our growth rate  value creation and long term business fundamentals 
our locally based investment professionals generally live in their local markets  allowing them to thoroughly research and evaluate potential investments at the street corner level of detail 
this locally based investment acumen guides our decisions in making investments  allowing us to continually upgrade the quality of our portfolio 
as a result  our portfolio is concentrated in many of the most desirable neighborhoods in the washington  dc metropolitan area  southern california  the san francisco bay area  chicago  the new york city metropolitan area  boston  southeast florida and seattle 
we believe that one of our most important responsibilities is to consistently make intelligent capital allocation decisions that maximize shareholder value 
for example  we took advantage of an extraordinary opportunity to sell million of non core assets to condominium converters at very attractive sales prices in the fourth quarter of we believe the sale of these non strategic assets at very low cap rates demonstrates the tremendous value embedded in our remaining portfolio 
development and redevelopment 
we believe we create significant value through the development of new apartment communities and the redevelopment of existing operating communities 
at december   we had  units  representing a total expected investment of million  of development communities under construction excluding ameriton in markets that include southern california  downtown boston  the washington  dc metropolitan area and the new york city metropolitan area 
in  we completed million of new development communities excluding ameriton  representing units in markets that include playa del rey  pasadena  and los angeles  calif 
during the year  four development properties achieved stabilization  representing a total expected investment of million and adding a total of units to archstone smith s same store operating portfolio 
ameriton properties incorporated 
ameriton is a wholly owned subsidiary of archstone smith that utilizes the company s development  acquisition and operating expertise to capitalize on short term real estate investment opportunities 
in  ameriton completed the sale of million of assets it had previously developed or acquired  representing  units 
since  ameriton has completed million in dispositions  generating pre tax gaap gains of million  the weighted average unleveraged pre tax irr on these dispositions was approximately 
as of december   ameriton had million  representing  units  of communities in development and owned or had an ownership position in million of operating communities  representing  units  that will be opportunistically sold over time 
conservative balance sheet management one of our primary financial objectives is to structure our balance sheet to enhance our financial flexibility in order to have access to capital when others in the industry do not 
we have a significant equity base  with equity market capitalization of billion  including the value of the a common units  as of december  our investment grade debt ratings from standard poor s bbb  moody s investors service baa and fitch  inc bbb are indicative of our solid financial position 
in  we increased our unencumbered asset base to billion as of the end of the year 
as of february   we had approximately million of liquidity  including cash on hand  restricted cash in 
table of contents escrows and capacity on unsecured credit facilities 
we believe this financial flexibility allows us to act more quickly on new investment opportunities as they arise 
we repurchased million of our common stock in  at prices ranging from to per share at an average price of per share 
in the fourth quarter  we paid a million one time special dividend of per share while maintaining our relatively low ratio of total debt to undepreciated book capitalization of at year end 
we also called all of our outstanding series d preferred shares and series f perpetual preferred units as well as a portion of our series e perpetual preferred units for redemption 
additionally  the series k and series l preferred shares were converted into common shares during the redemption and conversion of these preferred shares and units strengthens our balance sheet and will have a positive impact on our fixed charge coverage ratio going forward 
during the fourth quarter of  we opportunistically took advantage of the increased liquidity in the banking market to extend the maturity date of our million unsecured line of credit to december from october the syndication of our facility was heavily over subscribed  as we received over million of commitments from domestic and international financial institutions 
we also renegotiated several key terms  such as reducing our pricing by basis points to a libor spread of bps  and lowered the cap rate used to value our operating portfolio 
with these modifications  archstone smith now enjoys the lowest facility pricing and portfolio cap rate of any reit to our knowledge  which will directly benefit the company over the next three years 
our long term debt is structured to create a relatively level principal maturity schedule  without significant repayment obligations in any year 
we have only million of long term debt maturing in  representing of our total market capitalization 
the following summarizes our long term debt maturity profile for through  and thereafter  as of december  dollar amounts in millions of total market year total capitalization thereafter total total market capitalization as of december   represents the market capitalization based on the closing share price on the last trading day of the period for publicly traded securities  units and the liquidation value for private securities as well as the book value of total debt 
consistent dividend growth 
we paid dividends totaling per common share in  including our annualized quarterly dividend of per share and a one time special dividend of per share 
the special dividend resulted from the sale of approximately million of non core assets to condominium converters at an average combined capitalization rate below in the fourth quarter of in addition  we announced our anticipated distribution level of per share  a increase since  the year we began to focus exclusively on apartment communities 
with the increase  we have raised our annual distribution for consecutive years 
we have paid consecutive quarterly distributions 
management we have several senior executives who possess the leadership  operational  investment and financial skills and experience to oversee the overall operation of our company 
several of our senior officers could serve as the principal executive officer and continue our strong performance 
our management team emphasizes active training and organizational development initiatives for associates at all levels of our company in order to build long term management depth and facilitate succession planning

of the site level associates  approximately are subject to collective bargaining agreements with four unions in illinois and new york

similarly  we are insured against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse the company on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property  including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period 
our property policies for all operating and development communities include coverage for the perils of flood and earthquake shock with limits and deductibles customary in the industry 
we also obtain title insurance policies when acquiring new properties  which insure fee title to our real properties 
we currently have coverage for losses incurred in connection with both domestic and foreign terrorist related activities 
the terms of our property and general liability policies may exclude certain mold related claims or other types of claims based on the specific circumstances and allegations 
should an uninsured loss arise against the company  we would be required to use our own funds to resolve the issue  including litigation costs 

table of contents competition there are numerous commercial developers  real estate companies and other owners of real estate that we compete with in seeking land for development  apartment communities for acquisition and disposition and residents for apartment communities 
all of our apartment communities are located in developed areas that include other apartment communities 
the number of competitive apartment communities in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease units and on the rents charged 
in addition  single family homes and other residential properties provide housing alternatives to residents and potential residents of our apartment communities

the reference to our web site does not incorporate by reference the information contained in the web site and such information should not be considered a part of this report 
we have adopted a code of ethics and business conduct applicable to our board and officers and employees  including our principal executive officer  principal financial officer and principal accounting officer or controller 
a copy of our code of ethics and business conduct is included as an exhibit to this report and is available through our web site

risk factors the following factors could affect our future financial performance we have restrictions on the sale of certain properties 
a sale of any of the properties acquired in the smith merger prior to january   could result in increased costs to us in light of the tax related obligations made to the former smith partnership unitholders 
under the shareholders agreement between archstone smith  the operating trust  robert h 
smith and robert p 
kogod  we are restricted from transferring specified high rise properties located in the crystal city area of arlington  virginia until october   without the consent of messrs 
smith and kogod  which could result in our inability to sell these properties at an opportune time and at increased costs to us 
however  we are permitted to transfer these properties in connection with a sale of all of the properties in a single transaction or pursuant to a bona fide mortgage of any or all of such properties in order to secure a loan or other financing 
we depend on our key personnel 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers  senior officers and company managers 
there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us 
debt financing could adversely affect our performance 
we are subject to risks associated with debt financing and preferred equity 
these risks include the risks that we will not have sufficient cash flow from operations to meet required payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities at expected rates  that we will be unable to refinance current or future indebtedness  that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness  and that we will be unable to make necessary investments in new business initiatives due to lack of available funds 
increases in interest rates could increase interest expense  which would adversely affect net earnings 
table of contents and cash available for payment of obligations 
if we are unable to make required payments on indebtedness that is secured by a mortgage on our property  the asset may be transferred to the lender with a consequent loss of income and value to us 
additionally  our debt agreements contain customary covenants which  among other things  restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and  in certain instances  restrict our ability to engage in material asset sales  mergers  consolidations and acquisitions 
these debt agreements also require us to maintain various financial ratios 
failure to comply with these covenants could result in a requirement to repay the indebtedness prior to its maturity  which could have an adverse effect on our operations and ability to make distributions to shareholders 
some of our debt instruments bear interest at variable rates 
increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these instruments and would increase the cost of refinancing these instruments and issuing new debt 
as a result  higher interest rates would adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness 
we had billion in total debt outstanding as of december   of which billion was secured by real estate assets and million was subject to variable interest rates  including million outstanding on our short term credit facilities 
we may not have access to equity capital 
a prolonged period in which we cannot effectively access the public equity markets may result in heavier reliance on alternative financing sources to undertake new investment activities 
these alternative sources of financing may be more costly than raising funds in the public equity markets 
we could be subject to acts of terrorism 
periodically  we receive alerts from government agencies that apartment communities could be the target of both domestic and foreign terrorism 
although we currently have insurance coverage for losses incurred in connection with terrorist related activities  losses could exceed our coverage limits and have a material adverse affect on our operating results 
we are subject to risks inherent in ownership of real estate 
real estate cash flows and values are affected by a number of factors  including changes in the general economic climate  local  regional or national conditions such as an oversupply of communities or a reduction in rental demand in a specific area  the quality and philosophy of management  competition from other available properties and the ability to provide adequate property maintenance and insurance and to control operating costs 
real estate cash flows and values are also affected by such factors as government regulations  including zoning  usage and tax laws  interest rate levels  the availability of financing  property tax rates  utility expenses  potential liability under environmental and other laws and changes in environmental and other laws 
although we seek to minimize these risks through our market research and property management capabilities  they cannot be totally eliminated 
we are subject to risks inherent in real estate development 
we have developed or commenced development on a substantial number of apartment communities and expect to develop additional apartment communities in the future 
real estate development involves risks in addition to those involved in the ownership and operation of established communities  including the risks that financing  if needed  may not be available on favorable terms  construction may not be completed on schedule  contractors may default  estimates of the costs of developing apartment communities may prove to be inaccurate and communities may not be leased or rented on profitable terms or in the time frame anticipated 
timely construction may be affected by local weather conditions  local moratoria on construction  local or national strikes and local or national shortages in materials  building supplies or energy and fuel for equipment 
these risks may cause the development project to fail to perform as expected 

table of contents real estate investments are relatively illiquid and we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate 
equity real estate investments are relatively illiquid  which may tend to limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other market conditions 
our ability to dispose of assets in the future will depend on prevailing economic and market conditions 
compliance with environmental regulations may be costly 
we must comply with certain environmental and health and safety laws and regulations related to the ownership  operation  development and acquisition of apartments 
under those laws and regulations  we may be liable for  among other things  the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances  including asbestos related liability 
those laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to fault 
as part of our due diligence procedures  we have conducted phase i environmental assessments on each of our communities prior to acquisition  however  we cannot give any assurance that those assessments have revealed all potential liabilities 
costs associated with moisture infiltration and resulting mold remediation may be costly 
as a general matter  concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing as such exposure has been alleged to have a variety of adverse effects on health 
as a result  there has been a number of lawsuits in our industry against owners and managers of apartment communities relating to moisture infiltration and resulting mold 
we have implemented guidelines and procedures to address moisture infiltration and resulting mold issues if and when they arise 
we believe that these measures will minimize the potential for any adverse effect on our residents 
the terms of our property and general liability policies after june   may exclude certain mold related claims 
should an uninsured loss arise against the company  we would be required to use our own funds to resolve the issue  including litigation costs 
we can make no assurance that liabilities resulting from moisture infiltration and the presence of or exposure to mold will not have a future material impact on our financial results 
changes in laws may result in increased cost 
we may not be able to pass on increased costs resulting from increases in real estate taxes  income taxes or other governmental requirements  such as the enactment of regulations relating to internal air quality  directly to our residents 
substantial increases in rents  as a result of those increased costs  may affect the ability of a resident to pay rent  causing increased vacancy 
archstone smith s failure to qualify as a reit would have adverse consequences 
we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit under the internal revenue code and we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit 
we cannot  however  guarantee that we will continue to qualify in the future as a reit 
we cannot give any assurance that new legislation  regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the requirements relating to archstone smith s qualification 
if we fail to qualify as a reit  we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
also  unless the internal revenue service granted us relief  we would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year in which we failed to qualify 
in the event that we failed to qualify as a reit  we would be required to pay significant income taxes and would have less money available for operations and distributions to shareholders 
this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital 
in order to maintain our qualification as a reit under the internal revenue code  our declaration of trust limits the ownership of our shares by any person or group of related persons to  unless special approval is granted by our board 
the operating trust intends to qualify as a partnership  but we cannot guarantee that the operating trust will qualify 
the operating trust intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
however  the operating trust will be treated as an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes if it 
table of contents is deemed to be a publicly traded partnership  unless at least of its income is qualifying income as defined in the tax code 
qualifying income for the test generally includes passive income  such as real property rents  dividends and interest 
the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this test are similar in most respects 
we believe that the operating trust will meet this qualifying income test  but cannot guarantee that it will 
if the operating trust were to be taxed as a corporation  it will incur substantial tax liabilities  archstone smith would fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes and archstone smith s and the operating trust s ability to raise additional capital would be impaired 
we are subject to losses that may not be covered by insurance 
there are certain types of losses such as from war that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable 
additionally  many of our communities in california are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake fault lines and many of our southeast florida assets are in coastal locations and subject to hurricanes 
although we maintain insurance to cover most reasonably likely risks  including earthquakes and hurricanes  if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs  we could lose both our invested capital in  and anticipated profits from  one or more communities 
we may also be required to continue to repay mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to such communities 
the terms of our property and general liability policies after june   may exclude certain mold related claims 
we can make no assurance that liabilities resulting from moisture infiltration and the presence of or exposure to mold will not have a future material impact on our financial results 
should an uninsured loss arise against the company  we would be required to use our own funds to resolve the issue  including litigation costs 
any such loss could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have a concentration of investments in certain markets 
at december   approximately of our apartment communities are located in the washington  dc metropolitan area  based on noi

southern california is the geographic area comprised of the los angeles county  the inland empire  orange county  san diego and ventura county markets 
additionally  approximately of our apartment communities are located in the san francisco bay area of california at december   based on noi 
we are  therefore  subject to increased exposure positive or negative to economic and other competitive factors specific to protected markets within these geographic areas 
our business is subject to extensive competition 
there are numerous commercial developers  real estate companies and other owners of real estate that we compete with in seeking land for development  apartment communities for acquisition and disposition and residents for apartment communities 
all of our apartment communities are located in developed areas that include other apartment communities 
the number of competitive apartment communities in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease units and on the rents charged 
in addition  single family homes and other residential properties provide housing alternatives to residents and potential residents of our apartment communities

we also closed out on a high note with the announcement that archstone smith was being added to the s p index in december 
our same store revenues were up for the full year in the increase in same store revenues represents the first time annual same store revenue growth has been positive since the washington dc metropolitan area  southern california and southeast florida  which collectively represent of the company s portfolio  produced annual same store revenue growth of  and  respectively 
our most challenging core markets during were the san francisco bay area and chicago  which produced negative revenue growth of and  respectively 
our same store expenses increased and noi declined for the full year in the reit completed billion of non core asset sales in  including dispositions totaling million in the fourth quarter 
the dispositions produced gaap gains of million and an unleveraged internal rate of return of 
as a result of the significant gains generated by these asset sales  we paid a per share special dividend to shareholders in december additionally  ameriton completed the sale of million of assets producing pre tax gains of million 
the reit acquired million of apartment communities in excluding ameriton  representing  units  in markets that include the new york metropolitan area  los angeles county  southeast florida and the washington  dc metropolitan area 
these acquisitions were funded principally with tax deferred exchange proceeds from asset dispositions 
the reit currently has million in operating and joint venture properties under construction in markets that include southern california and the washington  dc metropolitan area  as well as million of developments in planning 
in addition  ameriton has million of development under construction and million in planning 
we expect our substantial development pipeline to contribute significantly to our earnings growth rate over the next five years as these projects are completed and stabilized 

table of contents overview in conjunction with our capital recycling strategy  rental revenues and rental expenses  including real estate taxes  will fluctuate based upon the timing and volume of dispositions  acquisitions and development lease ups 
accordingly  our results are not only driven by the performance of our operating portfolio  but also by gains losses from the disposition of real estate  the corresponding loss of ongoing income from assets sold  and increased income generated from acquisitions and new developments 
these factors all contribute to the overall financial performance of the company 
basic net earnings attributable to common shares increased million  or  in as compared to this increase is primarily attributable to increased revenues partially offset by a corresponding increase in operating expenses associated with billion and million in asset acquisitions  inclusive of ameriton  that occurred during and  respectively  increased income from the continued lease up of new development projects  a million increase in gains from the sale of operating communities  which includes gains from the sale of assets by ameriton  a million decrease in other expenses primarily due to lower moisture infiltration and resulting mold related expenses recognized during non operating income of million  from the sale and settlement of forward contracts on marketable equity securities resulting in a gain of million  and the disposition of our property management business  resulting in a million gain  during  a million increase in income from unconsolidated entities  primarily related to the recognition of million of contingent proceeds associated with the expiration of certain indemnifications from the sale of ces  which was sold in  and million of gains from the sale of joint venture operating assets during compared to million of gains in  and  a million reduction in preferred share dividends due to the conversion of series a and h preferred shares during  the redemption of series d preferred shares in august  the conversion of series k preferred shares in september and the early conversion of series l preferred shares in december these conversions and the redemption also eliminated the impact of the related preferred share dividends on our fixed charge coverage ratio 
these increases were partially offset by a increase in same store expenses during as compared to primarily due to increases in personnel costs and real estate taxes at both our garden and high rise properties our same store population excludes ameriton properties  as they are acquired or developed to achieve short term opportunistic gains  and therefore  the average holding period is typically much shorter than the holding period of assets operated by the reit  the loss of rental revenues and a corresponding decrease in rental expenses due to billion and billion in dispositions  including ameriton  during and  respectively  and  a million charge  net of anticipated insurance recoveries  associated with damage from hurricanes in florida 
basic net earnings attributable to common shares increased approximately million  or  in as compared to this increase is largely attributable to higher gains in of million as compared to million during  associated with an increase in the dispositions of depreciated real estate assets  lower interest expense associated with lower debt extinguishment costs and lower debt balances during and a reduction in interest rates on floating rate debt and refinanced debt  
table of contents a reduction in preferred share dividends during due to the conversion of series a and series h preferred shares into common shares in and the conversion of series j preferred shares into common shares and the redemption of series a preferred shares during  and increased rental revenue and corresponding increase in rental expense due to the acquisition of operating communities and the continued lease up and stabilization of development communities 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in rental revenue from our same store portfolio of for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in  primarily due to a decline in potential effective rent per unit and a decrease in average occupancy  the loss of rental revenue and a corresponding decrease in rental expense due to billion and million in dispositions during the twelve months ended december  and  respectively  and an increase of million in expenses associated with moisture infiltration and resulting mold during as compared to apartment community operations we utilize noi as the primary measure to evaluate the performance of our operating communities

discontinued operations the results of operations for properties sold during the period or designated as held for sale at the end of the period are required to be classified as discontinued operations 
the property specific components of net earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include rental revenues  rental expenses  real estate taxes  depreciation expense  minority interest  income taxes and interest expense actual interest expense for encumbered properties and a pro rata allocation of interest expense for any unencumbered property up to our weighted average leverage ratio  as well as the net gain or loss on the disposition of properties 
consistent with our capital recycling program  we had five operating apartment communities  representing  units unaudited  classified as held for sale under the provisions of sfas no 
 at december  accordingly  we have classified the operating earnings from these five properties within discontinued operations for the years ended december   and during the twelve months ended december   we sold archstone smith and ameriton operating communities 
the operating results of these communities and the related gain loss on sale are also included in discontinued operations for  and during the twelve months ended december   we sold operating communities 
the operating results of these communities and the related gain loss on the sale are also included in discontinued operations for and in addition  discontinued operations for the year ended december  includes the net operating results of operating communities and one retail property which were sold during the following is a summary of net earnings from discontinued operations in thousands years ended december  rental revenue rental expenses real estate taxes depreciation on real estate investments interest expense income taxes from taxable reit subsidiaries provision for possible loss on real estate investment debt extinguishment costs related to dispositions allocation of minority interest gain from the disposition of reit real estate investments  net gain from the dispositions of taxable reit subsidiary real estate investments  net total discontinued operations the portion of interest expense included in discontinued operations that is allocated to properties based on the company s leverage ratio was million  million and million for  and  respectively 

table of contents gains from the disposition of reit assets are the result of our capital recycling strategy  which redeploys capital from non core assets to more desirable locations within our core markets 
gains or losses associated with reit dispositions can vary significantly from year to year given overall real estate market conditions 
the majority of our gains from taxable reit subsidiaries were from ameriton  which is a wholly owned taxable reit subsidiary that engages in the opportunistic acquisition  development and eventual disposition of real estate with a short term investment horizon 
while ameriton has established a consistent track record of producing significant gains  which contribute to our overall net earnings  these gains or losses can fluctuate significantly on a year to year basis depending on the relative success of this component of our strategy 
assets held for sale as of december   represented gross real estate of million and million with mortgages payable of million and million at december  and  respectively 
additionally  of our investment in real estate and debt balances at december   we disposed of billion of real estate and paid off related mortgages of million during the twelve months ended december  liquidity and capital resources we are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and preserving our financial flexibility  which we believe enhances our ability to capitalize on attractive investment opportunities as they become available 
as a result of the significant cash flow generated by our operations  current cash positions  the available capacity under our unsecured credit facilities  gains from the disposition of real estate and ready access to the capital markets by issuing securities under our existing shelf registrations  we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash flow needs during operating activities net cash flow provided by operating activities increased million  or  in as compared to this increase was principally due to lower moisture infiltration and resulting mold related expenses during  lower interest expense due to a reduction in the average debt rates and a reduction in average debt balances during  as well as higher investment income from the sale of marketable equity securities

the increase was partially offset by million more spent for acquisitions and development activity during as compared to the disposition  acquisition and development amounts above exclude transactions funded by tax deferred exchange proceeds 
net cash flows provided by investing activities increased by approximately million in as compared to this increase was primary attributable to a million increase in proceeds from the disposition of real estate assets and a reduction in cash used to purchase marketable securities during as compared to this was partially offset by an increase in the balance of our tax deferred escrow

the amounts labeled discretionary represent future investments that we plan to make  although there is not a contractual commitment to do so 
the amounts labeled committed represent the approximate amount that we are contractually committed to fund for communities under construction in accordance with construction contracts with general contractors 
planned investments units discretionary committed communities under redevelopment communities under construction communities in planning and owned communities in planning and under control community acquisitions under contract total in addition to the planned investments noted above  we expect to make additional investments relating to planned expenditures on recently acquired communities as well as recurring expenditures to improve and maintain our established operating communities 
we anticipate completion of most of the communities that are currently under construction and the planned operating community improvements during and we expect to start construction on approximately million  based on total expected investment  of new development communities in we expect to fund the costs of these development projects over a two to three year period following the date construction commences 
no assurances can be given that communities we do not currently own will be acquired or that planned developments will actually occur 
in addition  actual costs incurred could be greater or less than our current estimates 
funding sources we anticipate financing our planned investment and operating needs primarily with cash flow from operating activities  disposition proceeds from our capital recycling program  existing cash balances and borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities  prior to arranging long term financing 
we anticipate that net cash flow from operating activities and gains on dispositions during will be sufficient to fund anticipated distribution requirements and debt principal amortization payments

litigation and contingencies we are subject to various claims in connection with moisture infiltration and resulting mold issues at certain high rise properties in southeast florida 
these claims generally allege that water infiltration and resulting mold contamination resulted in the claimants having personal injuries and or property damage 
although certain of these claims continue to be at various stages of litigation  with respect to the majority of these claims  we have either settled the claims and or we have been dismissed from the lawsuits that had been filed 
with respect to the lawsuits that have not been resolved  we continue to defend these claims in the normal course of litigation 
we have recorded accruals for moisture infiltration and resulting mold issues 
these accruals represent management s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable costs and are based  in part  on the settlements reached with the various claimants  estimates obtained from third party contractors and actual costs incurred to date 
it is possible that these estimates could increase or decrease as additional information becomes available 
we are aggressively pursuing recovery of a significant portion of these costs from our insurance carriers 
we are in litigation with our insurance providers  and therefore we have not recorded an estimate for future insurance recoveries associated with moisture infiltration and resulting mold 
in addition  we will continue to pursue potential recoveries from third parties whom we believe bear responsibility for a considerable portion of the costs we have incurred 
we cannot make assurances that we will obtain these recoveries or that our ultimate liability associated with these claims will not be material to our results of operations 
during  we incurred estimated losses associated with multiple hurricanes in florida 
as a result of this damage  we recorded a loss contingency of approximately million associated with both wholly owned and unconsolidated apartment communities 
this charge is offset by a  receivable for anticipated insurance recoveries 
these estimates represent management s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable costs and are based on the most current information available from our insurance adjustors 
during december  a lawsuit was filed against us that alleges various violations of the fair housing act and the americans with disabilities act at properties currently or formerly owned by the company 
the plaintiffs are seeking injunctive relief  in the form of retrofitting apartments and public accommodations 
table of contents to comply with the fair housing act and the americans with disabilities act  unspecified monetary damages for the diversion of the plaintiffs resources to address fair housing violations  punitive damages and attorneys fees 
we are in the process of evaluating the claims asserted in this litigation 
due to the preliminary nature of the litigation  it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the legal proceeding  nor is it reasonably possible to estimate the amount of loss  if any  that would be associated with an adverse decision 
we are a party to various other claims and routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
we do not believe that the results of any such claims or litigation  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies we define critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that require our management to exercise their most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
our management has discussed the development and selection of all of these critical accounting policies with our audit committee  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure relating to these policies 
our critical accounting policies relate principally to the following key areas internal cost capitalization we have an investment organization that is responsible for development and redevelopment of apartment communities 
consistent with gaap  all direct and certain indirect costs  including interest and real estate taxes  incurred during development and redevelopment activities are capitalized 
interest is capitalized on real estate assets that require a period of time to get them ready for their intended use 
the amount of interest capitalized is based upon the average amount of accumulated development expenditures during the reporting period 
included in capitalized costs are management s estimates of the direct and incremental personnel costs and indirect project costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities 
indirect project costs consist primarily of personnel costs associated with construction administration and development accounting  legal fees  and various office costs that clearly relate to projects under development 
because the estimation of capitalizable internal costs requires management s judgment  we believe internal cost capitalization is a critical accounting estimate 
if future accounting rules limit our ability to capitalize internal costs or if our development activity decreased significantly without a proportionate decrease in internal costs  there could be an increase in our operating expenses 
for example  if hypothetically  we were to reduce our development and land acquisition activity by with no corresponding decrease in internal costs  our net earnings per common share could decrease by approximately or approximately based on amounts 
valuation of real estate long lived assets to be held and used are carried at cost and evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted 
we also evaluate assets for potential impairment when we deem them to be held for sale 
valuation of real estate is considered a critical accounting estimate because the evaluation of impairment and the determination of fair values involve a number of management assumptions relating to future economic events that could materially affect the determination of the ultimate value  and therefore  the carrying amounts of our real estate 
when determining if there is an indication of impairment  we estimate the asset s noi over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted cash flow basis and compare this amount to its carrying value 
estimating the expected noi and holding period requires significant management judgment 
if it is determined that there is an indication of impairment for assets to be held and used  or if an asset is deemed to be held for sale  we then determine the asset s fair value 
the apartment industry uses capitalization rates as the primary measure of fair value 
specifically  annual noi for a community is divided by an estimated capitalization rate to determine the fair value of the community 
determining the appropriate capitalization rate requires significant judgment and is typically 
table of contents based on many factors including the prevailing rate for the market or submarket 
further  capitalization rates can fluctuate up or down due to a variety of factors in the overall economy or within local markets 
if the actual capitalization rate for a community is significantly different from our estimated rate  the impairment evaluation for an individual asset could be materially affected 
for example  we would value a community with annual noi of million at million using a capitalization rate  whereas that same community would be valued at million if the actual capitalization rate were 
historically we have had limited and infrequent impairment charges  and the majority of our apartment community sales have produced gains 
for example  we have sold approximately billion of real estate assets excluding ameriton over the last nine years  which produced billion in gains at an unleveraged internal rate of return of approximately 
we evaluate a real estate asset for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
capital expenditures and depreciable lives we incur costs relating to redevelopment initiatives  revenue enhancing and expense reducing capital expenditures  and recurring capital expenditures that are capitalized as part of our real estate 
these amounts are capitalized and depreciated over estimated useful lives determined by management 
we allocate the cost of newly acquired properties between net tangible and identifiable intangible assets 
the primary intangible asset associated with an apartment community acquisition is the value of the existing lease agreements 
when allocating cost to an acquired property  we first allocate costs to the estimated intangible value of the existing lease agreements and then to the estimated value of the land  building and fixtures assuming the property is vacant 
we estimate the intangible value of the lease agreements by determining the lost revenue associated with a hypothetical lease up 
we depreciate the building and fixtures based on the expected useful life of the asset and amortize the intangible value of the lease agreements over the average remaining life of the existing leases 
determining whether expenditures meet the criteria for capitalization  the assignment of depreciable lives and determining the appropriate amounts to allocate between tangible and intangible assets for property acquisitions requires our management to exercise significant judgment and is therefore considered a significant accounting estimate 
total capital expenditures were and of weighted average gross real estate as of december  and  respectively 
additionally  depreciation expense as a percentage of depreciable real estate was  and or  and per share for the years ended december   and  respectively 
if the actual weighted average useful life were determined to be one year shorter or longer than management s current estimate  our annual depreciation expense would increase or decrease approximately or per common share 
see note in our audited financial statements in this annual report for additional detail on depreciable lives 
pursuit costs we incur costs relating to the potential acquisition of real estate which we refer to as pursuit costs 
to the extent that these costs are identifiable with a specific property and would be capitalized if the property were already acquired  the costs are accumulated by project and capitalized in the other asset section of the balance sheet 
if these conditions are not met  the costs are expensed as incurred 
capitalized costs include but are not limited to earnest money  option fees  environmental reports  traffic reports  surveys  photos  blueprints  direct and incremental personnel costs and legal costs 
upon acquisition  the costs are included in the basis of the acquired property 
when it becomes probable that a prospective acquisition will not be acquired  the accumulated costs for the property are charged to other expense on the statement of earnings in the period such a determination is made 
because of the inherent judgment involved in evaluating whether a prospective property will ultimately be acquired  we believe capitalizable pursuit costs are a critical accounting estimate 
if it were determined that a quarter of our prospective acquisitions were deemed improbable as of december   net earnings for 
table of contents the year ended december  would decrease by approximately per share  excluding refundable earnest money 
off balance sheet arrangements investments in entities that do not qualify as a variable interest entity and are not controlled through majority economic interest are not consolidated and are reported as investments in unconsolidated entities 
our investments in unconsolidated entities at december   consisted of million in real estate joint ventures  which generally consist of our percentage ownership in the equity of the joint ventures 
consolidated engineering services is a service business that we acquired in the smith merger in  and prior to its sale had been reported as an unconsolidated entity in our financial statements 
ces provides engineering services for commercial and residential real estate across the country 
on december   ces was sold to a third party for million in cash 
we recorded a million net gain on the sale of the business or per share on a fully diluted basis 
as a condition of sale  we agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain representations and warranties contained in the sale contract 
during we recognized million of additional income associated with the expiration of these contingencies 
additionally  approximately million in contingent proceeds related to indemnification of accounts receivable over days were excluded from the initial gain 
we recognized million and million of these contingent proceeds during and  respectively 
we also recognized million related to settlement of an ongoing ces lawsuit during smith management construction  inc smc is a service business that we acquired in the smith merger during we sold smc during february to members of smc s senior management 
prior to the sale  we reported smc as an unconsolidated entity in our financial statements

the first note for million has principal payments that began in october with payment in full by february as of december   the outstanding balance on this note receivable was million 
the second note for million was fully repaid along with all accrued interest due during may during the second quarter of  we recognized the divestiture since our responsibilities under the majority of the outstanding performance guarantees  which pertain to ongoing construction projects at the time of sale  expired

we are still obligated for certain performance bond guarantees for smc subsequent to their sale  but there are recourse provisions available to us to recover any potential future payments from the new owners of smc

these derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges 
we do not use these derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes 
further  as a matter of policy  we only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge  we have not  nor do we expect to sustain a material loss from the use of these hedging instruments 
we formally assess  both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  whether each derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item 
we measure hedge effectiveness by comparing the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the derivative instrument with the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item 
we assess effectiveness of purchased interest rate caps based on overall changes in the fair value of the caps 
if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge  we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively 
to determine the fair values of derivative and other financial instruments  we use a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market value conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date 
these methods and assumptions include standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis  option pricing models  replacement cost and termination cost 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value  and therefore  are not necessarily indicative of the actual amounts that we could realize upon disposition 
during the years ended december   and we recorded an increase decrease to interest expense of   and  for hedge ineffectiveness caused by a difference between the interest rate index on a portion of our outstanding variable rate debt and the underlying index of the associated interest rate swap 
we pursue hedging strategies that we expect will result in the lowest overall borrowing costs and least degree of earnings volatility possible under the new accounting standards 
the following table summarizes the notional amount  carrying value and estimated fair value of our derivative financial instruments used to hedge interest rates  as of december  dollar amounts in

at inception  these swap transactions had an aggregate notional amount of million and a fair value of zero 
the long term unsecured debt these swap transactions related to was issued in august the hedge was terminated when the debt was issued 
the fair value of the cash flow hedge upon termination was a liability of approximately million 
this amount was deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income as additional interest expense as the hedged forecasted interest payments occur 
equity securities hedging activities we are exposed to price risk associated with changes in the fair value of certain equity securities 
during  archstone smith entered into forward sale agreements with an aggregate notional amount  which represents the fair value of the underlying marketable securities  of approximately million and an aggregate fair value of the forward sale agreements of approximately  to protect against a reduction in the fair value of these securities 
we designated this forward sale as a fair value hedge 
during  we settled all of the forward sales agreements for approximately million shares  and sold  shares of marketable securities which were not subject to forward sales agreements  resulting in an aggregate gain of approximately million

interest rate sensitive liabilities the table below provides information about our liabilities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  as the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions  which could arise after that date 
moreover  because there were no firm commitments to actually sell these instruments at fair value as of december   the information presented herein is an estimate and has limited predictive value
