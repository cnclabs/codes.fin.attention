item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including  but not limited to  those described under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we develop  market and sell integrated classroom based  print and online products and services to students  parents  educators and educational institutions 
we operate our businesses through three divisions  which correspond to our business segments 
test preparation services our test preparation services division provides classroom based and princeton review online test preparation courses  tutoring and admissions counseling services  and ses programs  and receives royalties from our independent franchisees who provide classroom based courses under the princeton review brand 
this division has historically accounted for the majority of our overall revenue and accounted for approximately of our overall revenue in after a strong start  the second half of proved challenging for this division  which grew a disappointing in during  the fastest growing areas for this division were its tutoring and online courses  in part because students were enrolling to prepare for the new version of the sat test  which went into effect in early  and ses courses  sales of which have increased in response to the increased emphasis on state assessments 
however  the growth in online and tutoring revenue was offset by lower enrollments in our lsat and gmat courses 
our lsat course was revamped in to target the more competitive student  with more than double the instruction time and more support materials 
despite very positive feedback from students  as well as increased score improvements  enrollment for this course was weak during the third quarter of this was due to the shortened sales season necessitated by the earlier start of a longer course 
this effect should have been better accounted for in planning and marketing efforts 
effects of this continued to be felt in courses for the october and december lsat 
however  february enrollment improved and june enrollment is showing significant improvement 
gmat enrollment was down in due to a general drop off in business school applications 
we expect weakness in gmat enrollments to continue until there is a recovery in business school applications 
additionally  during the third and fourth quarters of  sat enrollments were flat due to reduced test take volume in the december and january sat administrations after increased enrollment earlier in the third quarter 
students clearly were waiting to take the new sat across the board and spring enrollment is benefiting 
in addition  margins in this division declined from in to in primarily as a result of the weakness in enrollment 
class size and yield management are adversely impacted when enrollment falls short of plan 
k services our k services division provides a number of services to k schools and school districts  including assessment  professional development and face to face instruction 
as a result of the increased emphasis on accountability and the measurement of student performance in public schools in this country and the centralization of school districts purchasing of assessment  professional development and supplemental educational products and services  this division has seen the interest by the public school market for its products grow and the average dollar volume of its contracts double over the last year 
revenues in this division grew by in  compared to this division s revenue represented of our overall revenue in alongside the impressive revenue growth in our k services division  we have encountered several challenges 
as this division has grown over the last several years  we have begun to enter into more and more large  multiple element contracts with schools  school districts  municipal agencies  and other governmental bodies  requiring us to deliver a combination of products and services  including online and print based assessment  professional development  and face to face instruction 
the approval processes of some of our customers in this area  which are required for formal contract execution  are lengthy and cumbersome and  in many cases  are not completed prior to the time we begin performance 
this means that we  at times  incur substantial costs prior to the formal execution of these agreements by the customer 
while to date we have found that  following the award of the contract to us  final approval required for the customer to sign the agreement is usually a formality  our revenue recognition policies preclude us from recognizing revenue from these contracts until there is a final agreement binding on the customer 
costs  however  are recorded as incurred  whether or not the contract is signed 
in the third quarter of  this situation prevented us from recognizing approximately million in revenue from two significant contract renewals  which  despite our best efforts  were not formally executed until the fourth quarter 
these contracts therefore present several types of risks and uncertainties  including reducing our ability to effectively predict our operating performance  increasing variability in our cash balances and increasing credit risk 
these risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail under the heading risk factors in this form k 
while we see continued strong revenue growth in this division  operating results are difficult to predict accurately  due to the foregoing factors and the fact that each contract entered into by this division has its own  unique product mix 
because our various products in this division have different gross margins professional development and live course instruction products typically have lower gross margins than fees for assessment products and printed materials  contracts with varying product mix could significantly alter this division s operating results from period to period 
primarily due to changes in product mix  gross margins in this division declined from in to in admissions services our admissions services division currently derives most of its revenue from the sale of web based admissions and application management products and marketing services to educational institutions 
in  this division represented of our overall revenue 
in  the division s performance was again below management s expectations  primarily due to a lack of increase in demand for subscription based admissions and application management services 
for the second consecutive year  revenue in this division did not grow over the prior year 
we are currently in the process of refocusing this division s overall direction  with the goal of changing the way we charge post secondary academic institutions for our marketing services 
we are moving from a model of pricing for various bundles of marketing services  to a model where payment is based upon actual leads we generate 
we believe this model will allow us to better capitalize on the popularity of our web site with college and graduate school bound students 
to support this change in our marketing services model  we are re launching our web site with a view to optimizing our ability to match the right prospects with the post secondary institutions looking to attract them 
we believe that we will need to further increase revenues before this division will show sustainable operating profits  and it is management s hope that this new direction will provide the needed momentum to do so 
as a result of this division s disappointing results in  and the uncertainty of significant increases in future cash flows from the new marketing services described above  as of december   we wrote down approximately million of goodwill that we recorded in connection with our acquisition of embark 
revenue test preparation services 
the test preparation services division derives revenue primarily from classroom based and online test preparation courses and tutoring services  which consists of tuition and fees paid to our company operated sites 
we recognize revenue from tuition paid for our courses over the life of the course  which is usually from five to weeks depending on the course type

income taxes as a result of the establishment of a valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets we recorded an income tax expense of million for income tax expense was million for and income tax benefit was  for our effective income tax rate was for  for and for we currently have significant deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences that will reduce taxable income in future years 
our loss in and the emphasis placed on cumulative losses under generally accepted accounting principles represents sufficient evidence under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  for us to determine that it was appropriate to establish a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we have a full valuation allowance in although management expects these assets will ultimately be fully utilized  future performance cannot be assured 
the company will continue to evaluate the need for the valuation allowance in future periods 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and overall  results for were below expectations in all three divisions 
after returning to profitability in  we incurred a net loss of million in in the test preparation services division  weakness in enrollments in lsat and gmat courses offset growth in online courses  ses programs and tutoring  resulting in annual revenue growth of only 
despite revenue growth for the year of  the k services division experienced a longer sales cycle in closing on contracts 
the admissions services division  despite rolling out a new counseling product  failed to grow revenue for the second year in a row  primarily due to weak demand for subscription based services from its post secondary institution customers 
gross margins for the company as a whole slipped from in to in  due primarily to higher costs combined with lower enrollment in test preparation services and a less profitable product mix in k services 
on the expense side  professional fees  including those relating to sarbanes oxley compliance  were significantly higher than expected  and a bad debt expense relating to the write off of aged accounts receivable in the admissions services and k services divisions further hurt our bottom line 
additionally  we recorded a valuation allowance relating to our net deferred tax assets as of december   of approximately million  resulting in a tax charge of million in  and incurred an million impairment charge relating to the write down of goodwill 
revenue our total revenue increased from million in to million in  representing a increase 
test preparation services revenue increased from million in to million in  representing a increase  comprised primarily of an increase of approximately million in revenue from our company owned operations 
the increased revenue from company owned operations resulted from an increase of approximately  in revenue attributable to the operations acquired from our former franchisee  princeton review of north carolina  inc  and an increase of approximately million in course and tutoring revenue at our other locations 
this million increase is attributable to an increase in our tutoring  online course and ses revenue totaling million  which was partially offset by a decrease in retail classroom revenue of approximately million  primarily due to a drop in lsat and gmat course fees 
k services revenue increased from million in to million in  representing a increase 
this increase resulted primarily from an increase of approximately million in revenue from schools for assessment tests  printed materials  professional development and homeroom subscriptions  due to additional contracts signed in  as well as increased revenue from contracts signed in which were in effect for the full year in the increase in revenue from schools was partially offset by a decrease in fees from mcgraw hill 
admissions services revenue decreased from million in to million in  representing a decrease 
the approximate  in sales of college counseling services to high schools  a new product offering in by this division  was offset by a decrease in revenues from post secondary institutions 
cost of revenue our total cost of revenue increased from million in to million in  representing a increase 
test preparation services cost of revenue increased from million in to million in  representing a increase  primarily as a result of increasing the number of tutoring sessions and ses programs delivered 
cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased due to reduction in the average class size due to reduced enrollment  primarily in our lsat courses  as well as an increase in the relative cost of teachers and course materials 
k services cost of revenue increased from million in to million in  representing a increase 
this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in costs incurred to service increasing numbers and increasingly complex contracts with school based customers 
the percentage increase in cost of revenue was significantly higher than the increase in revenue in this division primarily because of the increased revenues from the lower margin professional development services 
admissions services cost of revenue increased from million in to million in  representing a increase  primarily due to increased customer support costs  including the new high school counseling product 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  representing a increase

we anticipate that professional fees related to sarbanes oxley compliance will continue to be significant in  with at least million in such fees anticipated in the first quarter of as we complete our section evaluation 
comparison of years ended december  and overview during the company achieved profitability primarily due to the continued profitability of the test preparation services division and the decreased operating losses in k services and admissions services  and our ability to keep sg a relatively flat 
our test preparation services revenue increased by  which was below expectations due to disappointing lsat and gmat enrollments 
our k services division revenue grew by  as this division s products gained a foothold in the marketplace 
our admissions services division revenue in remained the same as this division has experienced difficulties upselling services to its existing customer base and attracting new customers for its products 
revenue our total revenue increased from million in to million in  representing a increase 
test preparation services revenue increased from million in to million in  representing a increase  comprised primarily of an increase of approximately million in revenue from our company owned operations 
the increased revenue from company owned operations resulted from an increase of approximately million in revenue attributable to the operations acquired from our former franchisees  princeton review of st 
louis  in october  and princeton review of north carolina  in july  and an increase of approximately million at our other locations 
of the million increase at our other locations approximately million is attributable to enrollment increases  which was partially offset by decreases in average prices for courses 
the increase was also partially offset by the absence in of approximately  in revenue related to the development of a us army web site recorded in k services revenue increased from million in to million in representing a increase 
this increase resulted primarily from an increase of approximately million in revenue from schools  including several large school districts  for professional development  printed materials  benchmark testing  after school supplemental programs and homeroom subscriptions  primarily attributable to new contracts signed in these increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in workbook development fees and royalties from mcgraw hill 
admissions services revenue remained at the same level of million in and revenue from advertising fees from non school customers decreased by approximately  which was offset by increases in fees from post secondary institutions 
cost of revenue our total cost of revenue increased from million in to million in  representing a increase

this increase resulted primarily from the following an increase of approximately  in costs associated with the operation of the businesses acquired from princeton review of st 
louis and princeton review of north carolina  an approximately million increase in teacher pay due to salary increases and an increased number of classes  and an increase of approximately  in facility rental expense resulting from additional classes 
cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased due to smaller average class size  which lowers our gross margins 
k services cost of revenue increased from million in to million in  representing a increase 
this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in costs of approximately million incurred to service the school contracts for professional development  printed materials  benchmark testing  after school supplemental programs and homeroom subscriptions 
admissions services cost of revenue decreased from million in to million in  representing a decrease

other income our other income increased from  in to million in  representing a increase 
during december  we sold our preferred stock in  and certain contractual rights with  tutor 
com for million 
liquidity and capital resources our current primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flow from operations 
at december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents 
our test preparation services division has historically generated  and continues to generate  the largest portion of our cash from its retail classroom and tutoring courses 
these customers usually pay us in advance or contemporaneously with the services we provide  thereby supporting our short term liquidity needs 
increasingly  however  across all of our divisions  we are generating a greater percentage of our cash from contracts with institutions such as k schools and school districts and post secondary institutions  which pay us in arrears 
typical payment terms for these institutional customers range from to days 
additionally  the long contract approval cycles of some of our contracts with large institutions or school districts can contribute to the level of variability in the timing of our cash receipts  as these contracts sometimes require performance to begin significantly in advance of collection of payments 
during  we also experienced a significant increase in the aging of receivables from many of these customers  partially as a result of decreased focus on collections due to enormous strains on accounting resources required by the internal controls assessment mandated by section of sarbanes oxley 
while we have hired additional employees to collect these outstanding amounts  we had to increase our allowance for bad debts from million in to million in our days sales outstanding increased to days at the end of  from days at the end of cash provided by operating activities is net loss income adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities 
for  cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million in and million in in  the majority of the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to lower net income  net of non cash items  which was partially offset by lower working capital requirements 
during the increase in operating assets and liabilities resulting from the increased deferred income was partially offset by increases in accounts receivable 
deferred income increased due to increased tutoring fees collected but not earned as well as increased future revenue from contracts with institutional clients 
accounts receivable increased due to increased future enrollments in test preparation as well as increased contracts with institutional customers in k services and admissions services 
investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures and the payment for investments acquired 
we used million in net cash for investing activities during  compared to million during and million during the higher cash used in investing activities in compared to resulted from an approximate million investment in oasis childrens services llc and an increase in capital expenditures 
capital expenditures and additions to capitalized development projects and other assets totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in capital expenditures in over is due primarily to software purchased  increased development projects and new office construction 
capital spending for is expected to be between and million for additional software development and implementation costs  additional content development and equipment purchases 
financing cash flows consist primarily of transactions related to the sales of preferred stock and payments of debt related to acquisitions 
we generated million in net cash from financing activities in compared to uses of million and million in and  respectively 
during we raised approximately million from the sale of preferred stock  we paid down approximately of debt principal related to prior acquisitions and we borrowed million under a bank credit facility 
on june   we sold to fletcher  shares of series b preferred stock for million in the aggregate 
the series b preferred stock will pay quarterly dividends at a minimum rate of per annum  payable  at our option  in cash or registered shares of our common stock 
the series b preferred stock is convertible into  shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment upon certain events 
fletcher may also redeem its shares of the series b preferred stock  in lieu of converting such shares  at any time on or after november   for shares of common stock  unless we satisfy the conditions for cash redemption  for an amount of shares of our common stock based upon a redemption rate equal to of the then prevailing price of our common stock plus the value of any accrued and unpaid dividends 
fletcher also has the right  for a period of twenty four months  beginning on july   to purchase up to million of additional preferred stock 
the additional preferred stock is convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to of the then prevailing price of our common stock  subject to a minimum of per share 
on may   we entered into a credit agreement with commerce bank  na for a three year revolving credit facility with a maximum available borrowing of million 
the line of credit was secured by our accounts receivable and bore a variable interest rate based on either the prime rate or to basis points over the london interbank offered rate libor  in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
as of december   the effective interest rate was 
this credit facility was subject to our maintaining certain financial covenants and other covenants set forth in the credit agreement and required us to pay a quarterly unused facility fee of 
we borrowed million under this facility in may and used most of the proceeds to repay higher interest  fixed rate debt 
as of december   million was outstanding 
as of december   we were not in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement requiring the maintenance of a certain fixed charge  ebitda and interest coverage ratio 
as of december  the balance outstanding under the line of credit was reclassified to current liabilities as a result of such non compliance 
in february  we repaid the entire balance outstanding and terminated the credit facility 
we anticipate that our cash balances  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our normal operating requirements for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including market acceptance of our products and services and the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting these products and services 
we expect to continue to devote substantial capital resources to product development and support and advertising  marketing and promotional activities 
we also expect to continue to evaluate possible acquisition and strategic relationship opportunities  including possible acquisitions of businesses operated by our domestic franchisees  as well as other strategic alternatives  such as dispositions  reorganizations  recapitalizations or other similar transactions  and may therefore devote capital resources to consummating such transactions 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december   our principal contractual obligations and commercial commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under our long term office and classroom leases  obligations under promissory notes entered into in connection with acquisitions  employment agreements and several capital leases of computer equipment 
as of december   we operated from leased premises in new york  alabama  arizona  california  colorado  georgia  illinois  kansas  louisiana  maryland  massachusetts  minnesota  missouri  new jersey  north carolina  ohio  oklahoma  oregon  pennsylvania  south carolina  texas  virginia  washington  washington dc  and canada 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments set forth therein as of december  payments due by period in millions contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations credit facility see note purchase obligations total purchase obligations includes payments under employment agreements and other commitments to purchase goods and services adoption of new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb replaced sfas no 
with sfas no 
r  share based payments  which requires all share based payments to employees  including employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values effective july  based on the options outstanding as of december  we expect sfas no 
r to have a material impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
critical accounting policies the estimates  methods and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies significantly impact the results we report in our financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make subjective and difficult judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates include the assessment of the collectability of our accounts receivable balances  which impacts bad debt write offs  recoverability of goodwill  which impacts write offs of goodwill  assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  which primarily impacts operating margin when we impair assets or accelerate their depreciation  recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which impacts our tax provision and  to a lesser extent  revenue recognition  which impacts how and when we recognize revenue from our goods and services 
below  we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies 
however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we review our aged receivables monthly 
this review includes discussions with our customers and their account representatives  the customers payment history and other factors 
based on these reviews we may increase or decrease our allowance for bad debt if we determine there is a change in the collectability of our accounts receivable 
goodwill and territorial marketing rights 
we perform an annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist 
in each of and no impairment was indicated 
in  we wrote down million in goodwill in our admissions services division because we deemed this goodwill to be impaired due to the continued poor performance of this division 
our impairment review process is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses our estimates of revenue for the reporting units  driven by assumed market growth rates as well as appropriate discount rates 
these estimates are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage the underlying businesses 
long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable 
factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations  significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the related total future net cash flows 
if an asset grouping s carrying value is not recoverable through those cash flows  the asset grouping is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by the difference between the assets carrying amount and their fair value  based on the best information available  including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis 
income taxes 
in determining income for financial statement purposes  we must make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a reserve  in the form of a valuation allowance  for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
at december   we had a net deferred tax asset of approximately million  primarily relating to our net operating loss carryforwards of million  which expire in varying amounts between and realization of our deferred tax asset is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the united states prior to expiration of these loss carryforwards 
as of december   we recorded a valuation allowance for the entire net deferred tax asset because our loss in and the emphasis placed on cumulative losses under generally accepted accounting principles represents sufficient evidence under sfas no 
accounting for income taxes for us to determine that it was appropriate to establish a full valuation allowance 
if  in the future  an appropriate level and consistency of profitability is attained  we would reduce the valuation allowance  which would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
in general our revenue recognition policies do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective  with the possible exception being the recognition of revenue for separate units of accounting in accordance with eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in accounting for multiple element arrangements  one of the key judgments to be made is the accounting value that is attributable to the different contractual elements 
the appropriate allocation of value not only impacts which segment is credited with the revenue  it also impacts the amount and timing of revenue recorded in the consolidated statement of operations during a given period due to the differing methods of recognizing revenue for each product or service by each of the segments 
revenue is allocated to each element based on the accounting determination of the relative fair value of that element to the aggregate fair value of all elements 
the fair values must be reliable  verifiable and objectively determinable 
when available  such determination is based principally on the pricing of similar arrangements with unrelated parties that are not part of a multiple element arrangement 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our historical operations 
seasonality in results of operations we experience  and we expect to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations in our revenue because the markets in which we operate are subject to seasonal fluctuations based on the scheduled dates for standardized admissions tests and the typical school year 
these fluctuations could result in volatility or adversely affect our stock price 
we typically generate the largest portion of our test preparation revenue in the third quarter 
however  as ses revenues increase  we expect to recognize these revenues primarily in the first and fourth quarters 
the electronic application revenue recorded in our admissions services division is highest in the first and fourth quarters  corresponding with the busiest times of year for submission of applications to academic institutions 
our k services division may also experience seasonal fluctuations in revenue  with the first and fourth quarters corresponding to the school year expected to have the highest revenue 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our portfolio of marketable securities includes primarily short term money market funds 
the fair value of our portfolio of marketable securities would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due primarily to the short term nature of the portfolio 
all of our currently outstanding long term debt bears interest at fixed rates 
our recently issued series b preferred stock requires the payment of quarterly dividends at the greater of or above day libor 
during  we paid dividends on the series b preferred stock in an aggregate amount of  at an average rate of 
a basis point increase in the dividend rate would have resulted in a  increase in dividends paid during this period 
we repaid and terminated our line of credit in february we do not currently hold or issue derivative financial instruments 
revenue from our international operations and royalty payments from our international franchisees constitute an insignificant percentage of our revenue 
accordingly  our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations is minimal
