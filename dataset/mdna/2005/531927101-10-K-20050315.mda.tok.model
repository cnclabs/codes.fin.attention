item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of operations and financial condition of lifecell should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
special note certain statements set forth below constitute forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of see business special note regarding forward looking statements and business risk factors 
in the following discussions  most percentages and dollar amounts have been rounded to aid the presentation 
as a result  all such figures are approximations 
general and background we develop and market human derived tissue based products for use in reconstructive  urogynecologic and orthopedic surgical procedures to repair soft tissue defects 
our patented technology produces a unique regenerative human tissue matrix a complex three dimensional structure that contains vascular channels  proteins and growth factor binding sites that provides a complete template for the regeneration of normal human tissue 
our current products include alloderm  for plastic reconstructive  general surgical  burn and periodontal procedures  cymetra  a particulate form of alloderm suitable for injection  repliform  for urogynecologic surgical procedures  graftjacket and graftjacket xpress  for orthopedic applications and lower extremety wounds  and allocraft dbm  for bone grafting procedures 
we market alloderm for plastic reconstructive  general surgical and burn applications through our direct sales organization 
our strategic sales and marketing partners include boston scientific for repliform  wright medical group  inc for graftjacket  stryker corporation for allocraftdbm and biohorizons for periodontal applications of alloderm 
our ongoing research and product development strategy is focused on extending the utilization of our regenerative tissue matrix into new markets and the application of our core technology to other tissues 
critical accounting policies estimates we have identified the policies below as critical to the understanding of our financial statements 
the application of these polices requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the valuation of assets and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to these estimates on our business operations are discussed below 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue for product sales when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers  which is generally when product is shipped to the customer 
additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations 
we utilize independent sales and marketing agents to supplement our direct sales organization 
for products marketed through our independent sales and marketing agents  we recognize revenue when the products are delivered to the third party customer  as this is when title and risk of loss to the product transfers 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in revenue at the time the related product revenue is recognized 
research grant revenues are recognized at the time qualified expenses are incurred  unless we have continuing performance obligations  in which case revenue is recognized upon the satisfaction of such obligations 
accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for estimated bad debt losses on our accounts receivable based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
since our accounts receivable are not concentrated within a relatively few number of customers  we believe that a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one customer would not have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and therefore our future operating results 
while bad debt losses depend to a large degree on future economic conditions affecting our customers  we do not anticipate significant bad debt losses in inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
we record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on inventory quantities on hand  our historical product sales  and estimated forecast of future product demand and production requirements 
although we believe that our current inventory reserves are adequate  any significant change in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and therefore our future operating results 
income taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining our income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
we apply an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets of million is dependent upon our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the deferred tax asset 
in the event we determine that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is recorded 
at december   the valuation allowance of  primarily reflected uncertainties involving the realization of certain tax credits due to the potential impact of future stock option exercises and shorter term expiration dates 
results of operations years ended december  and total revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to a increase in product revenues to million in the current period as compared to million in the prior year 
revenues generated from the use of our products in reconstructive surgical procedures increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the growth was primarily driven by increased demand for alloderm in complex hernia repair procedures  partially offset by a decrease in cymetra revenues 
alloderm revenues increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in cymetra revenues were negatively impacted by competitive products in and we expect this trend to continue in revenues generated from the use of our repliform product in urogynecologic surgical procedures decreased to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in demand for repliform in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence has been negatively affected by competition from synthetic alternatives and we anticipate this trend to continue in orthopedic product revenue grew to million in from million in this revenue growth resulted from increased demand for our graft jacket product  which was launched in the first quarter of  and allocraft dbm  which was introduced on a limited basis in the fourth quarter of graft jacket and allocraft dbm revenues were million and million  respectively  in compared to million and  in our independent sales and marketing agents and distributors generated of our total product revenue in the year ended december  and in boston scientific and wright medical represented and  respectively  of our total product revenues in compared to and  respectively  for the same period in no other individual independent sales agent or distributor generated more than of our total product revenues in the year ended december  total revenues were also favorably impacted by a increase in research grant revenues  which totaled million in compared to million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in research spending on projects funded by approved research grants  since research grant revenues are recognized when qualified expenses are incurred 
as of december   approximately million of approved grant funding was available to fund future research and development expenses through cost of products sold for the year ended december  was million  or of product revenues  compared to cost of products sold of million  or of product revenue for the same period in in  the cost of products sold included costs related to the launch of allocraft dbm which increased the cost of products sold as a percentage of product revenues 
total research and development expenses increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to increased research and development headcount  professional fees and expenses related to animal studies 
our research and development initiatives include programs designed to extend the use of our current regenerative tissue matrix products into new surgical applications as well as leveraging our core technology to other tissues 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in regulatory and acconting professional fees  payroll and related expenses associated with increased headcount and annual merit increases and depreciation expense associated with a new fully integrated computer software system 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to i higher selling expenses  principally payroll  commissions and travel and entertainment resulting from increased revenues and the expansion of our direct sales force and ii an increase in marketing and medical education expenses for alloderm 
our independent sales and marketing agents are paid agency fees based on the amount of product revenues they generate for us 
selling and marketing expenses included agent fees of million and million  respectively  in and the decrease in agent fees resulted from a decline in revenue generated through our independent sales and marketing agents 
interest and other income expense  net increased  in compared to the net increase was primarily due to a  increase in interest income primarily resulting from a higher level of investments and a  decrease in interest expense resulting from the pay off of outstanding debt in the third quarter of the provision for income taxes was  in compared to a benefit of million in prior to the fourth quarter of  no provision or benefit for income taxes was recorded because we were in a net deferred tax asset position and a full valuation allowance had been recorded 
during the fourth quarter of  we re evaluated the amount of valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets and reduced the valuation allowance to reflect net deferred tax assets that we believed were more likely than not of being realized 
the reduction in the valuation allowance resulted in the recognition of a non cash income tax benefit of million in the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we further reduced the amount of the valuation allowance which resulted in the recognition of a non cash income tax benefit of million 
the income tax provision for the year ended december  is net of the benefit recorded in the fourth quarter 
the valuation allowance of  at december  applies to certain tax credits that  in the opinion of management are more likely than not to expire before we can use them 
years ended december  and total revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to a increase in product revenues to million in the current period as compared to million in the prior year 
revenues generated from the use of our products in reconstructive surgical procedures increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the growth was driven by increased demand for alloderm  partially offset by a decrease in cymetra revenues 
alloderm revenues increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in cymetra revenues have been negatively impacted by competitive products  and we expect this trend to continue in revenues generated from the use of our repliform product in urogynecologic surgical procedures decreased to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in demand for repliform in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence has been negatively affected by competition from synthetic alternatives  and we anticipate this trend to continue in orthopedic product revenue grew to million in from  in this revenue growth resulted primarily from the full market launch of our graftjacket product in the first quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we introduced allocraft dbm on a limited basis  and revenues from this product were not significant in our independent sales and marketing agents and distributors generated of our total product revenue in the year ended december  and in one of our independent agents  boston scientific corporation  represented of our total product revenues in compared to for the same period in no other individual independent sales agent or distributor generated more than of our total product revenues in the year ended december  total revenues were also favorably impacted by a increase in research grant revenues  which totaled million in compared to million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in research spending on projects funded by approved research grants  since research grant revenues are recognized when qualified expenses are incurred 
as of december   approximately million of approved grant funding was available to fund future research and development expenses through cost of products sold for the year ended december  was million  or of product revenues  compared to cost of products sold of million  or of product revenue for the same period in the increase in cost of products sold as a percentage of products sold was primarily the result of costs related to the launch of allocraft dbm 
total research and development expenses increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily associated with higher spending on research focused on the potential application of our tissue matrix technology to vascular tissue  which is funded through a grant from the department of defense  and increased spending on allocraft dbm product development and other product development programs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in payroll and related expenses  professional fees and training and travel expenses associated with training and implementation costs associated with a new fully integrated computer software system 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase in was primarily attributable to higher selling expense associated with the expansion of our direct sales force and an increase in marketing expenses relating to the launch of alloderm for new surgical indications 
our marketing agents are paid agency fees based on the amount of product revenues they generate for us 
selling and marketing expenses include marketing agent fees of million and million  respectively  in and the decrease in agent fees resulted from the decrease in revenue generated through our independent sales and marketing agents 
interest and other income expense  net decreased  in the year ended december  compared to the net decrease was primarily due to a  decrease in interest expense resulting from a decrease in debt outstanding 
prior to  no deferred provision or benefit for federal income taxes was recorded because we were in a net deferred tax asset position and a full valuation allowance had been recorded 
during the fourth quarter of  we re evaluated the amount of valuation allowance required in light of profitability achieved in recent years and expected in future years 
as a result  we reduced the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets to an amount that we believe is more likely than not of being realized based on our assessment of the likelihood of future taxable income 
the reduction in the valuation allowance resulted in the recognition of a non cash income tax benefit of million in the fourth quarter of at december   the valuation allowance primarily reflected uncertainties involving the realization of certain tax credits and loss carryforwards due to the potential impact of future stock option exercises and shorter term tax asset expiration dates 
in  we also realized  through the sale and transfer of million of state tax net operating losses 
in  we realized  through the sale and transfer of million of state tax net operating losses 
the sales and transfers were made through the technology business tax certificate program sponsored by the new jersey economic development authority 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million and million in long term marketable securities compared to million and million  respectively  at december  working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase in working capital resulted primarily from increases in cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and accounts receivable  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
our operating activities generated net cash of million for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in the increase in was principally due to higher net income excluding the non cash tax benefits  an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  net of an increase in accounts receivable 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily associated with higher accrued employee compensation and benefits 
the increase in accounts receivable resulted from the significant increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of versus the fourth quarter of capital expenditures were million in and consisted primarily of manufacturing equipment and computer hardware  software and related implementation costs 
in  capital expenditures totaled million 
our financing activities generated million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in in  the cash generated from financing activities resulted from the exercise of common stock options and warrants  while in cash generated by financing activities resulted from the issuance of common stock  partially offset by the retirement of all outstanding debt 
at december   we had no debt outstanding under our borrowing arrangements 
in march  the borrowing limit on our revolving line of credit was increased to million and the expiration was extended through march we plan to maintain a revolving line of credit  however we do not have a commitment beyond the current expiration date 
the credit facility is collateralized by our accounts receivable  inventory  intellectual property  intangible and fixed assets and contains certain financial covenants and a subjective acceleration clause 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants of our credit facility 
the following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than one year to years to years after years operating leases total contractual cash obligations we believe that our current cash resources together with anticipated product revenues  committed research and development grant funding and remaining availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our planned operations  research and development programs and fixed asset requirements in the foreseeable future 
however  we may need additional funds to meet our long term strategic objectives 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve significant restrictive covenants and we cannot assure that such financing will be extended on terms acceptable to us or at all 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended december   and new accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter the amendments made by sfas no 
clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freights  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  earlier application is permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of this recently issued accounting pronouncement to have a material impact on its financial position  cash flows  or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  or r  share based payment a revision of fasb statement no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the new standard will be effective beginning july  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of the following methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we have not determined the method in which we will adopt sfas r 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall cash flows and financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
note stock based compensation of our financial statements illustrates the effect on net income if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas to all stock based employee compensation 
these pro forma amounts may not be representative of the effects on reported net income for future years due to the uncertainty of stock option grant volume  potential changes in assumptions and other factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our investments in certain marketable securities  consisting principally of fixed income debt securities 
although our investments are available for sale  we generally hold such investments to maturity 
our investments are stated at fair value  with net unrealized gains or losses on the securities recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
net unrealized gains and losses were not material at december  or
