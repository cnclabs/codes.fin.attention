item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the research and development of novel immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer 
immunotherapies are treatments that utilize the immune system to combat diseases 
our lead product candidate  myvax personalized immunotherapy  is a patient specific active immunotherapy that is based on the unique genetic makeup of a patient s tumor and is designed to activate a patient s immune system to identify and attack cancer cells 
myvax is currently in a pivotal phase clinical trial and additional phase clinical trials for the treatment of b cell non hodgkin s lymphoma  or b cell nhl 
b cells  also called b lymphocytes  are one of the two major classes of lymphocytes  which are types of white blood cells 
in the united states  b cell nhl represents approximately to of over  existing and approximately  newly diagnosed nhl patients each year 
nhl is clinically classified as either slow growing  referred to as indolent  or fast growing  referred to as aggressive 
there are approximately  patients diagnosed with indolent b cell nhl in the united states each year 
our pivotal phase clinical trial is for the treatment of follicular b cell nhl  which represents approximately half of the cases of indolent b cell nhl 
results from our completed and ongoing clinical trials of myvax for the treatment of b cell nhl indicate that myvax is generally safe and well tolerated 
we believe that patient specific active immunotherapies can also be applied successfully to the treatment of other cancers 
as a result  we are also developing myvax for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia  or cll 
in november  based on positive interim phase clinical trial results from our trial  we initiated a pivotal  double blind  controlled phase clinical trial  our trial  to treat patients with follicular b cell nhl 
we believe that  if successful  the results of the trial will support our application for regulatory approval of myvax for the treatment of follicular b cell nhl 
we completed patient registration  the process during which a patient is screened and a biopsy is taken to determine whether the patient is eligible to participate in the clinical trial  in april our independent data safety monitoring board  or dsmb met on november  to review data in the clinical trial 
after reviewing safety data for the entire phase clinical trial and blinded  preliminary immune response data for more than of the initial patients immunized in the clinical trial  the dsmb noted no concerns and recommended that the trial continue as planned 
we currently anticipate that the two planned interim analyses will be initiated in approximately the second quarter of and the second quarter of  with the detailed follow up period of the clinical trial scheduled to conclude in approximately the fourth quarter of the total research and development costs associated with and incurred for the development of myvax for the treatment of b cell nhl were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
from inception through december   the total research and development costs associated with and incurred for the development of myvax for the treatment of b cell nhl were approximately million 
we have not generated any revenues  and we have financed our operations and internal growth through private placements of common and preferred stock  including our recent private placement of common stock in december  our line of credit facilities  our completed initial public offering in november  our completed follow on public offering in june  and interest income earned from our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we are a development stage enterprise and have incurred significant losses since our inception in as we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development activities  including clinical trials 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our accumulated deficit resulted principally from our research and development activities associated with myvax  including our pivotal phase clinical trial and additional phase clinical trials  and several non cash charges associated with our preferred stock financings 
our accumulated deficit includes a non cash dividend of million related to our preferred stock financings in april and may of  a non cash charge of million associated with the extinguishment of convertible notes and cancellation of the related warrants issued to preferred stockholders in august and non cash interest expense of million relating to the amortization of the discount on the convertible notes  and non cash interest expense of million associated with the amortization of the warrants issued to the guarantor of our lines of credit 
we have repaid all outstanding borrowings under these facilities  and in november  we terminated both facilities 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
we anticipate working on a number of long term development projects which will involve experimental and unproven technology 
the projects may require many years and substantial expenditures to complete and may ultimately be unsuccessful 
we will need operating funds to continue our research and development activities  clinical trials  pursue regulatory approvals and build production  sales and marketing capabilities  as necessary 
even if we achieve positive interim results in our pivotal phase clinical trial and receive regulatory approval for myvax  including regulatory approval of a commercial scale manufacturing facility  we anticipate that the earliest we could realize product revenue is until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue  if ever  we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements  as well as through interest income earned on cash balances 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research and 
table of contents development programs or our commercialization efforts 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and any additional debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
drug development in the united states is a process that includes several steps defined by the food and drug administration  or fda 
the fda approval process for a new biologic or drug involves completion of preclinical studies and the submission of the results of these studies to the fda  together with proposed clinical protocols  manufacturing information  analytical data and other information in an investigational new drug application  or ind  which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase  and the most significant costs associated with clinical development are the phase clinical trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
after completion of clinical trials  a new drug application  or nda  or a biologics license application  or bla  may be filed with the fda 
in responding to an nda or a bla  the fda may grant marketing approval  request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval 
the successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain 
we cannot estimate with certainty or know the exact nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of myvax or the date of completion of these development efforts 
we anticipate that the earliest we could realize product revenues is and we cannot reasonably estimate when we may have material net cash inflows from sales of myvax  if ever 
we cannot estimate with certainty any of the foregoing due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing myvax  including the possibility of delays in the collection of clinical trial data and the uncertainty of the timing of the interim analyses of our pivotal phase clinical trial  the uncertainty of clinical trial results  extensive governmental regulation  both foreign and domestic  for approval of new therapies  and the uncertainty related to the leasing and completion of construction and qualification of a commercial scale manufacturing facility 
if we fail to complete the development of myvax in a timely manner  it could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
in addition  any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
a further discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our projects on schedule  or at all  and certain consequences of failing to do so are set forth in the risk factors entitled we will need substantial additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed  which would force us to delay  reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts  we currently have no source of revenue and may never become profitable  if clinical trials of myvax  or any other immunotherapies that we may develop  do not produce successful clinical trial results  we will be unable to commercialize these products and our efforts to discover  develop and commercialize myvax for indications other than follicular b cell nhl are at an early stage and are subject to high risk of failure  as well as other risk factors 
we expect to continue to incur net losses over the next several years as we continue our clinical development  apply for regulatory approvals  construct and qualify a commercial scale facility for the manufacture of myvax  develop active immunotherapies for cll and t cell nhl and potentially other forms of cancer  establish sales and marketing and distribution capabilities and expand our operations 
significant financing events since  we have been successful in completing several rounds of private equity financing 
in  the sale of series e convertible preferred stock generated million of cash proceeds 
in april and may of  we raised million through the sale of additional series e convertible preferred stock  convertible notes which converted into series e convertible preferred stock during the quarter ended september  and warrants 
in november  we sold  shares of common stock in an initial public offering for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
after deducting the underwriters commission and offering expenses  we received net proceeds of million 
in june  we completed a follow on offering in which we sold  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
after deducting the underwriters commission and offering expenses  we received net proceeds of approximately million 
in december  we completed a private placement in which we sold  shares of common stock at an offering price of per share for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
after deducting the placement agent s fee and offering expenses  we received net proceeds of approximately million 

table of contents critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements clinical trial accruals 
our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations 
these costs are a significant component of research and development expenses 
in the normal course of business  we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the on going development of myvax 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and variation from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful accrual of patients or the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
we accrue for the costs of clinical studies conducted by contract research organizations  or cros  based on estimated costs over the life of the individual study 
further  we monitor patient registration levels and related activity to the extent possible and adjust our estimates on a monthly basis 
in addition to considering information from our clinical operations group regarding the status of our clinical trials  we rely on information from cros  to calculate our accrual for direct clinical expenses at the end of each reporting period 
for indirect expenses  which relate to site and other administrative costs to manage our clinical trials  we rely on information provided by the cro  including costs incurred by the cro as of a particular reporting date  to calculate our indirect clinical expenses 
our estimates and assumptions may not match the timing of actual services performed by the organizations  which may result in adjustments to our research and development expenses in future periods marketable securities 
we classify all of our marketable securities as available for sale 
we carry these investments at fair value  based on quoted market prices  and unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the amortized cost of securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretions of discounts to maturity 
such amortization is included in interest income 
realized gains and losses are recorded in our statement of operations 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline exists  it is our policy to record a write down to reduce the investments to fair value and record the related charge as a reduction of interest income 
stock based compensation 
we have a stock option plan to reward and provide incentives to our employees  which is described more fully in note to the financial statements 
we account for this plan under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb and related interpretations and apply the disclosure provisions of statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
we amortize stock based compensation in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 an accelerated vesting model 
for financial reporting purposes  we have recorded stock based compensation representing the difference between the deemed fair value of common stock and the option exercise price 
prior to the closing of our initial public offering  we determined the deemed fair value of our common stock based upon several factors  including significant clinical milestones attained  sales of our convertible preferred stock  changes in valuations of existing comparable publicly registered biotechnology companies  trends in the broad market for biotechnology stocks and the expected valuation we would obtain in our initial public offering 
subsequent to the offering  we determined the deemed fair value of our common stock based on quoted market prices 
all stock options granted subsequent to the offering were granted at exercise prices equal to the fair market value 
we recorded deferred stock based compensation of million and million for stock options granted to employees during the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   there was no deferred stock based compensation recorded 
we have amortized million  million and million of these amounts in the years ended december    and  respectively 
the compensation expense will be decreased in the period of forfeiture for any accrued but unvested compensation arising from the early termination of an option holder s services 
we disclose in note to the financial statements the pro forma impact of applying the provision of sfas  as amended  to our stock awards 
prior to the closing of our initial public offering  the fair value of options issued  pursuant to our option plan at the grant date  were estimated using the minimum value method 
this model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
following the offering  the value of each option has been estimated using the black scholes model 
the effects of applying pro forma disclosures of net loss and net loss per share are not likely to be representative of the pro forma effects on net loss and net loss per share in the future as the number of shares to be issued under the plan including any future plans is not known and the assumptions used to determine the fair value can vary significantly 

table of contents additionally  as described more fully in note to the financial statements  we issue stock options to non employees  generally for services  which we account for under the provisions of sfas and emerging issues task force eitf no 
these options are also valued using the black scholes model 
for stock options issued to non employees  we amortized million and million of stock compensation expense for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the year ended december   there was no amortization 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the eitf reached a consensus on recognition and measurement guidance previously discussed under eitf no 
the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  eitf 
the consensus clarifies the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to investments classified as either available for sale or held to maturity under sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and investments accounted for under the cost method or equity method 
the recognition and measurement guidance for which the consensus was reached is to be applied to other than temporary impairment evaluations 
in september  the fasb issued a final fasb staff position fsp  fsp eitf  that delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance of eitf we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting eitf in april  the eitf issued eitf no 
 participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
 earnings per share  eitf 
eitf addresses a number of questions regarding the computation of earnings per share by companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends and earnings of the company when  and if  it declares dividends on its common stock 
eitf also provides further guidance in applying the two class method of calculating earnings per share  clarifying what constitutes a participating security and how to apply the two class method of computing earnings per share once it is determined that a security is participating  including how to allocate undistributed earnings to such a security 
eitf is effective for fiscal periods beginning after march  the adoption of eitf did not have a material effect on our results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and 
the new pronouncement replaces the existing requirements under sfas and apb according to sfas r  all forms of share based payments to employees  including employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans  would be treated the same as any other form of compensation by recognizing the related cost in the statement of operations 
this pronouncement eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation transactions using apb and generally would require that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
for public companies  the fasb has determined that sfas r is effective for awards and stock options granted  modified or settled in cash in interim or annual periods beginning after june  sfas r provides transition alternatives for public companies to restate prior interim periods or prior years 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact of this standard on our financial statements 
results of operations research and development expenses in millions  except percentages year ended december  annual percent change staffing related clinical trial and manufacturing material costs amortization of deferred stock based compensation facilities and other costs total research and development expenses research and development expenses represented approximately of our total operating expenses for each of the years ended december  and and approximately of our total operating expenses for the year ended december  research and development expenses include the personnel costs related to our development activities and clinical trial preparations  preclinical and clinical trial expenses  including costs related to registration  treatment and monitoring expenses  costs related to regulatory matters and the costs related to the development of our manufacturing process 
research and development expenses increased in from due primarily to higher staffing levels and recruiting costs  of which million was related to the addition of manufacturing and quality assurance and control personnel 
in addition  clinical trial costs associated with our lead product  myvax  and costs related to manufacturing materials and external testing  increased by million 
this was offset partially by a decrease in non cash stock based compensation expense of million related to the cancellation of unvested stock options 
the increase in from was a result of continued increase in patient registration in our pivotal phase clinical trial 
these increases were primarily related to higher staffing levels  of which million was related to the addition of manufacturing and quality assurance and control personnel 
in addition  clinical trial costs and costs related to 
table of contents manufacturing materials and external testing increased by million and non cash stock based compensation expense increased by million related to the cancellation of unvested stock options 
this was partially offset by a decrease in facilities and other costs of million related to lower depreciation and lower occupancy costs due to a decrease in rental rates 
we expect to devote substantial resources to research and development in future periods as we continue our development of myvax and expect our research and development expenditures to increase during and subsequent years 
many factors can affect the cost and timing of our clinical trials  including inconclusive results requiring additional clinical trials  slow patient enrollment  adverse side effects among patients  insufficient supplies for our clinical trials and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of our clinical trials 
in addition  the development of our products will be subject to extensive governmental regulation 
these factors make it difficult for us to predict the timing and costs of further development and approval of our products 
sales and marketing expenses in millions  except percentages year ended december  annual percent change staffing related product advocacy costs amortization of deferred stock based compensation facilities and other costs total sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs and outside marketing activities related to product support and awareness 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in from and in from was primarily due to increased product advocacy costs related to clinical trial support and awareness and initiation of commercialization planning projects for myvax 
we expect sales and marketing spending to increase in and subsequent years as we prepare for the possible commercialization of myvax for the treatment of b cell nhl 
general and administrative expenses in millions  except percentages year ended december  annual percent change staffing related legal  professional fees and insurance amortization of deferred stock based compensation facilities and other costs total general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs of administrative personnel and related costs to support our organizational growth  as well as legal  accounting and other professional fees 
the increase in from was primarily attributable to additional administrative expenses of approximately million related to higher staffing costs  legal and professional fees and corporate insurance costs to support the organizational growth and responsibilities of being a public company 
this was partially offset by a decrease of million in non cash stock based compensation expense related to the cancellation of unvested stock options 
the increase in from was due to an increase in staffing costs  legal and accounting fees and corporate insurance costs of million related to supporting the organizational growth and responsibilities of being a public company 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional fees of million incurred in associated with unsuccessful financings 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase during as a result of additional administrative and infrastructure costs associated with being a public company  including costs associated with ongoing compliance with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of and potential implementation of new finance and accounting systems 
loss on extinguishment of convertible notes and cancellation of series e convertible preferred stock warrants in millions  except percentages year ended december  annual percent change loss on extinguishment of convertible notes and cancellation of series e convertible preferred stock warrants n a 
table of contents we recorded a million loss related to the extinguishment of convertible notes and cancellation of convertible preferred stock warrants for the year ended december  no such charge was recorded during the corresponding period in or in interest expense in millions  except percentages year ended december  annual percent change interest expense n a interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to interest expense of million for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recorded interest expense of million related to the amortization of the discount on our convertible notes  million related to the amortization of the warrant issued in connection with our lines of credit and million related to the stated interest on the convertible notes 
no such charges were recorded during the corresponding period in or interest expense for the year ended december  was related to expense incurred for our capital lease obligations 
interest and other income  net in millions  except percentages year ended december  annual percent change interest and other income  net interest and other income  net for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase in from was due to interest on higher average cash balances as a result of the cash proceeds received from our completed initial public offering in november  and our completed follow on public offering in june the decrease in from was due to lower average cash balances and lower interest rates in dividend related to issuance of convertible preferred shares and the beneficial conversion feature of preferred stock in millions  except percentages year ended december  annual percent change dividend related to issuance of convertible preferred shares and beneficial conversion feature of preferred stock n a we recorded a non cash dividend of million related to the issuance of convertible preferred shares and the beneficial conversion feature of preferred stock for the year ended december  no such charge was recorded for the years ended december  or liquidity and capital resources in millions as of december  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities year ended december  cash flows net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  compared to million as of december  we have not generated any revenues  and we have financed our operations and internal growth through private placements of common and preferred stock  including our recently completed private placement of common stock in december  our line of credit facilities  our completed initial public offering in november  our completed follow on offering in june  and interest income earned from our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception in and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our accumulated deficit resulted principally from our research and development activities associated with myvax  including our pivotal phase clinical trial and additional phase clinical trials  and several non cash charges associated with our preferred stock financings 
included in our accumulated deficit is a non cash dividend of million related to our preferred stock financings in april and may also  our accumulated deficit includes a non cash charge of million associated with the extinguishment of convertible notes and cancellation of the related warrants issued to preferred stockholders in august and million of non cash interest expense relating to the amortization of the discount on the 
table of contents convertible notes 
additionally  there was non cash interest expense of million associated with the amortization of the warrant issued to the guarantor of our lines of credit 
through december   we had amortized and expensed non cash stock based compensation of million 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increased use of cash in operations for compared to was primarily due to our continued research and development activities associated with myvax for the treatment of b cell nhl and higher cash usage for prepaids and other assets and accounts payable  due to the timing of payments made  offset partially by an increase in accrued liabilities 
the change in net cash used in compared to was primarily due to the increase in net loss in  adjusted for non cash items such as interest expense on convertible notes  amortization of warrant issued to guarantor of lines of credit  loss on extinguishment of convertible notes and cancellation of convertible preferred stock warrants  as well as an increase in accounts payable  due to the timing of payments made 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
capital expenditures  consisting of purchases of office and laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements to our facilities  were million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we expect our capital expenditures to increase in future years to support our development and commercialization efforts 
during the year ended december   we purchased million of marketable securities  which was partially offset by maturities and sales of marketable securities of million 
during the years ended december and  we did not have any marketable securities 
in the future  net cash used by investing activities may fluctuate from period to period due to timing of payments for capital expenditures and maturities sales and purchases of marketable securities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during the year ended december   we completed a follow on public offering  in which we sold  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
after deducting the underwriters commission and offering expenses  we received net proceeds of approximately million 
in december  we completed a private placement in which we sold  shares of common stock at an offering price of per share for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
after deducting the placement agent s fee and offering expenses  we received net proceeds of approximately million 
we also received approximately million related to proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
these proceeds were offset partially by payments of million related to offering costs from our initial public offering 
the net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily attributable to net proceeds received from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering of million  the private sale of million of preferred stock  the sale of million of convertible promissory notes and warrants and proceeds received from line of credit facilities of million  partially offset by payments of million related to the same line of credit facilities 
net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to net proceeds received from the issuance of convertible preferred stock of million 
as of december   we had contractual obligations related to operating and capital leases as follows in thousands payments due by period less than beyond total year years years years contractual obligations non cancelable operating lease obligations capital lease obligations total contractual obligations our long term commitments under operating leases shown above consist of payments relating to four real estate leases and subleases covering the  square feet of our present facility 
these leases and subleases expire between january and november in march  we entered into a new real estate lease related to one of these subleases 
this new lease expires in july and we estimate that our commitment under this lease is approximately million through july  we anticipate working on a number of long term development projects which will involve experimental and unproven technology 
the projects may require many years and substantial expenditures to complete and may ultimately be unsuccessful 
we will need operating funds to continue our research and development activities and clinical trials  pursue regulatory approvals and build production  sales and marketing capabilities  as necessary 
we believe that our current cash resources  together with the interest thereon  will provide us with sufficient financial resources for at least the next months 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the risk factors discussed in this report 
we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
we expect that our cash consumption will increase in as we anticipate an increase in operating expenses related to the growth of the company  as well as the build out of our commercial manufacturing facility 
we will need to raise additional funds to complete the construction and qualification of a commercial scale manufacturing facility and to commercialize myvax if myvax receives regulatory approval for the treatment of follicular b cell nhl 

table of contents a commercial scale manufacturing facility must be built and qualified and pass a pre approval inspection from the appropriate regulatory agency prior to any regulatory approval for myvax 
we anticipate spending for a commercial scale manufacturing facility to begin in the first half of we estimate that the total cost of the facility  including related manufacturing equipment  could exceed million or more 
even if we achieve positive interim results in our pivotal phase clinical trial and receive regulatory approval for myvax  including regulatory approval of our commercial scale manufacturing facility  we anticipate that the earliest we could realize product revenue is until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue  if ever  we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  corporate collaboration or licensing arrangements or other arrangements  as well as through interest income earned on cash balances 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
to the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience dilution  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies  myvax or any other immunotherapies that we may develop  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or our commercialization efforts 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our marketable securities 
the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our invested cash without significantly increasing risk of loss 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over yield considerations 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million 
due to the nature of these investments  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the decline in the total fair value of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities would be immaterial 
in addition  we do not have any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations as we operate primarily in the united states
