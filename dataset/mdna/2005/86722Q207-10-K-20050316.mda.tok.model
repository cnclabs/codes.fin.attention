item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements as of the dates and for the periods presented in this section 
you should read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
we are a leading provider of digital wireless communications services in the southeastern united states  puerto rico and the us virgin islands 
as of december   our wireless communications network covered approximately million potential customers in a contiguous geographic area encompassing portions of north carolina  south carolina  tennessee  georgia and kentucky 
in addition  we operate a wireless communications network covering approximately million potential customers in puerto rico and the us virgin islands 
triton provides its wireless communications services under the suncom wireless brand name 
from until december  we were a member of the at t wireless network and a strategic partner with at t wireless 
beginning in  at t wireless contributed pcs licenses to us covering various markets in the southeastern united states in exchange for an equity position in holdings 
as part of our transactions with at t wireless  we were granted the right to be the exclusive provider of wireless mobility services using co branding with at t corp 
within our markets 
in october  cingular wireless acquired all of the outstanding stock of at t wireless through a merger of a cingular wireless subsidiary with and into at t wireless 
in connection with this transaction  triton  at t wireless and cingular wireless and or certain of their subsidiaries entered into various agreements to modify our relationships with at t wireless 
under these agreements  which are described in the overview section of part i of this annual report  at t wireless surrendered to holdings  following the october consummation of the at t wireless cingular wireless merger  all of the equity interests in holdings held by at t wireless  and the parties concurrently terminated the agreement under which at t wireless had granted us the exclusive right to provide at t wireless branded wireless services within our region 
the termination of the exclusivity arrangement permits the new at t cingular wireless entity entry in our service area and provides us the opportunity to offer service in markets where we were previously prohibited 
in addition  in december  triton and cingular wireless completed a major exchange of wireless network properties  under which cingular wireless received our network assets and customers in virginia and we received certain at t wireless network assets and customers in north carolina  puerto rico and the us virgin islands  plus million in cash 
this exchange transaction transformed the geographic strategic focus of our wireless network by giving us substantial new presence in the charlotte  raleigh durham and greensboro  north carolina markets and entry into the puerto rico market 
our entry into these markets will allow us to operate a contiguous footprint in the carolinas and will provide us with a greater ability to grow our subscriber base 
the exchange transaction also poses certain uncertainties 
for example  puerto rico and the us virgin islands are new markets for us  and we may not be able to successfully integrate our operations and compete in the puerto rico and us virgin island market due to the general economic  business  political and social conditions in the caribbean region  including the effects of world events and weather conditions on tourism in puerto rico and the us virgin islands 
we also expect that the puerto rico and us virgin island market will generate less roaming revenue than the virginia market 
in addition  we may be required to make capital expenditures to upgrade the existing pcs network in puerto rico and the us virgin islands to the same technological standard of our gsm gprs network 
our strategy is to provide extensive coverage to customers within our region  to offer our customers high quality  innovative voice and data services with coast to coast coverage and to benefit from roaming revenues generated by other carriers wireless customers who roam into our covered area 

table of contents we believe our markets are strategically attractive because of their strong demographic characteristics for wireless communications services 
according to the paul kagan associates report  our service area includes of the top markets in the country with population densities that are higher than the national average 
since we began offering service in our markets  our subscriber base and total revenues have grown significantly 
from our initial launch of personal communications services in january  our subscriber base has grown to  subscribers as of december  as the result of our growing subscriber base  total revenues have increased from million for the year ending december  to million for the year ending december  revenues consist primarily of monthly access  airtime  long distance and roaming charges billed to our subscribers  equipment revenues generated by the sale of wireless handsets and accessories to our subscribers and roaming revenues generated by charges to other wireless carriers for their subscribers use of our network 
roaming minutes generated by non triton subscribers increased from a monthly high of million minutes in to a monthly high of million minutes in  with total roaming minutes rising to billion minutes in as the result of the termination of our first amended and restated stockholders agreement and the exclusivity arrangement with at t wireless contained in that agreement  we do not expect the trend of increasing roaming minutes to continue 
for more information about roaming expectations  refer to the description of the triton pcs agreement under overview in item business 
our net loss has decreased from a loss of million for the year ended december  to net income of million for the year ended december  the net income increase is primarily due to an aggregate pre tax non operating gain of approximately million realized on the triton holdings agreement and the triton pcs agreement as well as our exchange agreement with cingular wireless and at t wireless 
despite our net income for the year ended december   we expect to incur net losses in the foreseeable future primarily as the result of interest expense exceeding income from operations 
our accumulated deficit decreased to million as of december   as a result of our net income for the current year 
since the inception of our personal communications services in january  our long term debt has increased from million to billion as of december  this increase is due primarily to the increased funding required to build out our network  which includes  cell sites and ten switches 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenues as services are rendered 
unbilled revenues result from service provided from the billing cycle end date to the end of the month and from other carriers customers using our network 
in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  in a subscriber activation  the total proceeds are allocated to the associated deliverables 
when equipment cost exceeds equipment revenue  referred to as equipment margin  the activation fee collected  up to the amount of the equipment margin  is recognized immediately as equipment revenue 
any subscriber activation fee collected in excess of the equipment margin is deferred and recognized over the estimated subscriber s life 
equipment sales are a separate earnings process from other services we offer and are recognized 
table of contents upon delivery to the customer and reflect charges to customers for wireless handset equipment purchases 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our subscribers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of a material portion of our subscribers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts by applying estimated loss percentages against the aging of our accounts receivable balances 
the estimated loss percentages are updated periodically and are based on our historical write off experience  net of recoveries 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would increase income in the period we made that determination 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period we made that determination 
we establish additional provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that our tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain positions that are likely to be challenged and may or may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
we adjust these additional accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  other than indefinite lived intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results or significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or in the strategy for our overall business 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
when we determine that the carrying value of a long lived asset is not recoverable  we measure any impairment based upon a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate we determine to be commensurate with the risk involved 
our primary indefinite lived intangible assets are fcc licenses and goodwill 
we test investments in fcc licenses and goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that these indefinite lived intangible assets may be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value with the carrying value 
we aggregate all of our fcc licenses for the purpose of performing the impairment test as the licenses are operated as a single asset and  as such  are essentially inseparable from one another 
in addition  we aggregate all goodwill into the same unit of accounting for the purpose of performing its impairment test 
we estimate the useful lives of our property  plant and equipment and our finite lived intangible assets in order to calculate depreciation and amortization expense on these assets 
we periodically evaluate our useful lives  considering such factors as industry trends  new technologies and significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or in the strategy for our overall business 
the actual useful lives may be different than our estimated useful lives  which would thereby result in different carrying values of our property  plant  equipment and intangible assets 
these evaluations could result in a change in our depreciable lives and  therefore  our depreciation and amortization expense in future periods 

table of contents revenue we derive our revenue from the following sources service 
we sell wireless personal communications services 
the various types of service revenue associated with wireless communications services for our subscribers include monthly recurring charges for access  features and fees and monthly non recurring airtime charges for local  long distance and roaming airtime used in excess of pre subscribed usage 
our customers roaming charges are rate plan dependent and are based on the number of pooled minutes included in their plans 
service revenue also includes non recurring activation service charges and universal service fund program revenue 
equipment 
we sell wireless personal communications handsets  data devices and accessories that are used by our customers in connection with our wireless services 
equipment sales are a separate earnings process from other services offered by triton  and we recognize equipment sales upon delivery to the customer and reflect charges to customers for wireless handset equipment purchases 
roaming 
we charge per minute fees and per kilobyte fees to other wireless telecommunications companies for their customers use of our network facilities to utilize wireless services 
in addition  our roaming revenue is contingent upon our roaming partners subscriber growth  their use of our network as well as industry consolidation 
we believe our roaming revenues will be subject to seasonality  as we expect to derive increased revenues from roaming during vacation periods  reflecting the large number of tourists visiting resorts in our coverage area 
as a result of our new roaming agreement with the merged cingular wireless at t wireless and our new service area resulting from our exchange transaction with cingular wireless and at t wireless  we expect roaming minutes of use and roaming rates payable to triton to decrease in the future  resulting in significantly decreased revenue 
costs and expenses our costs of services and equipment include equipment 
we purchase personal communications services handsets and accessories from third party vendors to resell to our customers for use in connection with our services 
because  when selling directly to our customers  we subsidize the sale of handsets to encourage the use of our services  the cost of handsets is higher than the resale price to the customer 
we do not manufacture any of this equipment 
roaming fees 
we incur fees to other wireless communications companies based on airtime usage by our customers on other wireless communications networks 
transport and variable interconnect 
we incur charges associated with interconnection with wireline and other wireless carriers networks 
these fees include fixed monthly connection costs and other variable fees based on minutes of use by our customers 
variable long distance 
we pay usage charges to long distance companies for long distance service provided to our customers 
these variable charges are based on our subscribers usage  applied at pre negotiated rates with the other carriers 
cell site costs 
we incur expenses for the rent of towers  network facilities  engineering operations  field technicians and related utility and maintenance charges 
other expenses include selling  general and administrative 
our selling expense includes advertising and promotional costs  commission expense for our sales associates and agents and fixed charges such as store rent and retail associates salaries 
general and administrative expense includes customer care  billing  financial services and bad debt  information technology  finance  accounting and legal services 

table of contents certain portions of functions such as customer care  billing  finance  accounting  human resources and legal services are centralized in order to achieve economies of scale 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight line method  generally over three to twelve years  based upon estimated useful lives 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful lives of the assets or the term of the lease 
network development costs incurred to ready our network for use are capitalized 
depreciation of network development costs begins when the network equipment is ready for its intended use and is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset 
amortization of finite lived intangible assets  including branding  subscriber lists and income leases  is computed using the straight line method based upon estimated useful lives 
prior to january   our personal communications services licenses and our cellular licenses were being amortized over a period of years 
in  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  and as a result  we ceased to amortize our fcc licenses  which we believe qualify as having an indefinite life 
termination benefits and other related charges 
for the year ended december   we recorded expenses related to a workforce reduction that occurred in january these expenses consisted primarily of one time termination benefits and relocation expenses 
non cash compensation 
as of december   we recorded million of deferred compensation associated with the issuances of our common stock to employees 
we generally will recognize this compensation over four to five years as the stock vests 
interest expense income 
interest expense through december  consisted primarily of interest on our new senior secured term loan that expires in  our senior subordinated notes due  our senior subordinated notes due and our senior notes due  net of capitalized interest 
interest expense also includes any commitment fees paid during the year on the undrawn portion s of our old credit facility and the amortization of deferred costs incurred in connection with our issuance of debt instruments 
interest income is earned primarily on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
other expense 
other expense primarily includes losses incurred on our previously held interest rate swap agreements 
as of december   we did not have any interest rate swap arrangements 
debt extinguishment costs 
for the year ended december   we recorded expenses related to the retirement of our old credit facility and our subordinated notes 
these expenses consisted primarily of a premium paid to holders of the subordinated notes who tendered their notes  tender offer fees and the write off of deferred financing costs 
other income 
for the year ended december   other income consisted primarily of the gains resulting from the consummation of our definitive agreements with at t wireless and cingular wireless and the repurchase of a portion of our notes and our notes 
income tax expense 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted statutory rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we provide valuation allowances for deferred tax assets for which we do not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not 
we establish additional provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that our tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain positions that are likely to be challenged and may or may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
we adjust these additional accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances 
our ability to improve our margins will depend on our ability to manage our variable costs  including selling  general and administrative expense  costs per gross added subscriber and costs of maintaining and 
table of contents upgrading our network 
we expect our operating costs to grow as our operations expand and our customer base and call volumes increase 
over time  these expenses should represent a reduced percentage of revenues as our customer base grows 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net subscriber additions were a negative  and a positive  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was driven by a combination of higher subscriber churn on a larger subscriber base and a reduction in our gross subscriber additions 
total subscribers were  as of december   an increase of over our subscriber total as of december  the increase was attributable to the net subscriber increase of  resulting from the exchange transaction with at t wireless and cingular wireless  offset partially by negative net adds 
subscriber churn was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase stems primarily from increased voluntary subscriber deactivations resulting from the implementation of a service plan restructuring during the second and third quarters of  which increased fees on our unplan offering 
in addition  churn increased as a result of certain rate plan offerings to credit challenged subscribers 
subscriber churn is calculated by dividing subscriber deactivations by our average subscriber base for the respective period 
our voluntary churn also increased as a result of the uncertainty regarding our relationship with at t wireless during the period from the announcement of the at t wireless and cingular wireless merger until its consummation in october in addition  as of may  we offered local number portability  or lnp  to all markets in our service area 
we believe that churn may increase slightly in the near future due to the transition s impact on acquired at t wireless subscribers  including anticipated churn from discontinued service offerings in the prepaid product mix and expected attrition of certain corporate users  which will be partially offset by the reduced impact of the price increases and lnp 
average revenue per user  or arpu  was and for the year ended december  and  respectively 
arpu reflects the average amount billed to subscribers based on rate plan offerings 
arpu is exclusive of service revenue credits made to retain existing subscribers and revenue not generated by wireless subscribers of and per average subscriber for the years ended december  and  respectively 
arpu is calculated by dividing service revenue  excluding service revenue credits made to existing subscribers and revenue not generated by wireless subscribers  by our average subscriber base for the respective period 
for more details regarding our calculation of arpu  refer to reconciliation of non gaap financial measures below 
the arpu decrease of  or  was primarily the result of a decrease in billable overage and roaming charges  offset partially by an increase in fees charged to recoup expenditures incurred to comply with federal mandates and increases in revenue related to new handset features 
total revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  service revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in service revenue was due primarily to an increased number of average subscribers during  partially offset by a slight decrease in arpu 
we expect subscriber growth to continue  hence  we expect service revenue to continue to increase 
roaming revenue was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in roaming revenue was primarily the result of reductions in contractual roaming rates agreed to with other carriers 
roaming minutes for the year ended december  were billion  which was flat compared to the year ended december  tdma minutes decreased for the year as the result of certain factors affecting the traffic from our largest roaming partners 
this included at t wireless reduced customer growth as well as cingular wireless successful transition to gsm gprs  which allows them to utilize their own network in a large portion of our territory 
these decreases were offset by increased gsm gprs roaming minutes of use 
table of contents resulting from the successful completion of our gsm gprs overlay and the implementation of a new roaming agreement with t mobile 
in addition  triton received a million payment in october  resulting from the settlement with one of our roaming partners related to handset programming issues 
although we expect the growth of the wireless industry to continue in the future  we expect that our roaming revenues will decrease significantly in due to declining roaming rates and roaming minutes of use as the result of the at t wireless and cingular wireless merger 
equipment revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  equipment revenue includes the revenue earned on the sale of a handset or handset accessories to new and existing subscribers 
the equipment revenue increase was due primarily to an increase in handset sales to existing subscribers as well as increased prices resulting from the transition of tdma handsets to gsm gprs handsets  which offer more advanced capabilities 
cost of service excluding amortization  depreciation and non cash compensation was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to operating two network technologies as well as a higher volume of traffic on our network driven by rate plan offerings and subscriber growth 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in roaming expense resulting primarily from contractual rate decreases that occurred during the second half of as a result of the variable components of cost of service  such as interconnect and toll  our cost of service may increase in conjunction with our anticipated subscriber growth 
cost of service as a percentage of service revenue was and for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease of was primarily attributable to a lower incollect expense rate per minute of use 
cost of service as a percentage of service revenue may decline in the future as we expect to leverage the fixed components of cost of service against increased revenue 
cost of equipment was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  cost of equipment includes the cost associated with the sale of a handset or handset accessories to new and existing subscribers 
the cost of equipment increase was driven primarily by an increase in handset sales to existing subscribers and increased costs of handsets resulting from the transition of tdma handsets to gsm gprs handsets  which offer more advanced capabilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses excluding amortization  depreciation and non cash compensation were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  selling expenses decreased by million  or  primarily due to a decrease in advertising and promotional costs for the year ended december  we expect advertising and promotional costs to increase in as a result of our launch of the new suncom brand as well as efforts to gain new subscribers through more frequent advertising 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  primarily due to increases in headcount costs of million  consulting fees of million and existing customer based marketing expenses of million 
as a result of the variable components of selling  general and administrative expense  such as customer care personnel and billing costs  our selling  general and administrative expenses may increase in conjunction with anticipated subscriber growth 
general and administrative expense as a percentage of service revenue was and for the year ended december  and  respectively 
this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the expenses discussed above 
these higher expenses were partially offset by lower bad debt expense of million during the year ended december  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of service revenue may increase in the near term as a result of acquiring the north carolina  puerto rico and us virgin island markets 
this higher percentage may begin to decline in the future as we expect to leverage our fixed general and administrative costs  such as headcount and rent expense  against increased revenue 
cost per gross addition  or cpga  was and for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the cpga decrease of  or  was primarily the result of decreased advertising 
table of contents and promotional spending for the year ended december   offset partially by increased fixed acquisition costs such as store rent and retail headcount 
cpga is calculated by dividing the sum of equipment margin for handsets sold to new subscribers equipment revenue less cost of equipment  which costs have historically exceeded the related revenue and selling expenses related to adding new subscribers by total gross subscriber additions during the relevant period 
retail customer service expenses and the equipment margin on handsets sold to existing subscribers  including handset upgrade transactions  are excluded  as these costs are incurred specifically for existing subscribers 
for more details regarding our calculation of cpga  refer to reconciliation of non gaap financial measures below 
there were no termination benefits and other related charges for the year ended december  termination benefits and other related charges were million for the year ended december  these expenses  which consisted primarily of severance and relocation costs  resulted from the streamlining of our operations during january non cash compensation expense was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  non cash compensation represents the amortization of restricted stock  valued at the date of grant  over the applicable vesting period 
in addition  contributions of our class a common stock made to our k savings plan are also included in non cash compensation 
the decrease reflects a lower average share price for recent grants as well as a reduced number of restricted class a common shares vesting during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this was the result of the acceleration of a portion of our retired chief operating officer s restricted shares during the second quarter of in accordance with his retirement agreement 
depreciation  asset disposal and amortization expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily driven by a million incremental increase resulting from the acceleration of depreciation on our tdma wireless communication equipment which resulted from the successful launch of our overlapping next generation gsm gprs network in all of our covered markets 
in addition  we experienced increased depreciation expense resulting from capital expenditures during the year 
these increases in depreciation and asset disposal expense were partially offset by a million loss recognized during the year ended december  in connection with the disposal of certain cell site equipment deemed to be obsolete 
amortization expense increased due to the acceleration of million of our brand license agreement with at t wireless as a result of their merger with cingular wireless and the understanding that the post merger company will not utilize the at t brand as well as the acceleration of million of our roaming agreement with at t wireless resulting from its termination 
in addition  amortization expense increased as the result of commencing amortization on our newly acquired intangibles  including the suncom brand  subscriber lists and income leases  which we received in the various transactions with at t wireless and cingular wireless 
interest expense was million  net of capitalized interest of million  for the year ended december  interest expense was million  net of capitalized interest of million  for the year ended december  the decrease of million  or  relates primarily to a decrease of million of interest expense on our subordinated notes  which we repurchased in june and july and a decrease of million of interest expense on our former bank credit facility  which was retired in june  offset partially by an increase of million of interest expense related to our june offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes and an increase of million on our new senior secured term loan 
we had a weighted average interest rate of for the year ended december  on our average obligation for our senior and subordinated debt and senior secured term loan  compared with our weighted average interest rate of for the year ended december  other expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the other expense line item consists of losses associated with the retirement of our five interest rate swap derivative instruments 
the 
table of contents other expense line item consists primarily of a million loss on our former interest rate swap derivative instruments  which were extinguished in june  and a million loss incurred from our investment in lafayette communications company  llc there were no debt extinguishment costs for the year ended december  debt extinguishment costs were million for the year ended december  these expenses  which consisted primarily of tender offer premium  tender offer fees and the write off of deferred financing costs  resulted from the repurchase of million aggregate principal amount of our subordinated notes and the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under our former bank credit facility 
interest income  other income and other gains were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase stems primarily from a million gain  net of million of expenses  from the consummation of our exchange agreement with at t wireless  a million gain  net of million of expenses  from the consummation of the triton holdings agreement and the triton pcs agreement with at t wireless and cingular wireless  and a million gain associated with the partial repurchase of our and subordinated notes and the termination of our old credit facility 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or compared to million for the year ended december  this increase stems primarily from the recognition of a greater deferred tax liability associated with the consummation of our definitive agreements with at t wireless and cingular wireless during pursuant to our adoption of sfas no 
 we can no longer reasonably estimate the period of reversal  if any  for the deferred tax liabilities related to our licensing costs  therefore  we will continue to incur deferred tax expense as additional deferred tax liabilities associated with the amortization of the tax basis of our fcc licenses are incurred 
net income was million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of and million for the year ended december  the net income increase of million was due primarily to the gain resulting from the consummation of the triton holdings agreement  the triton pcs agreement and the exchange agreement with at t wireless and cingular wireless during the year ended december  year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net subscriber additions were  for the year ended december   bringing our total subscribers to  as of december   an increase of over our subscriber total as of december  our strategy of shifting our channel mix to more cost effective  company owned retail locations and strategically aligned agents adversely impacted new subscriber additions  as several inefficient agent relationships were terminated 
new subscriber additions were also impacted by the bankruptcy of our largest independent agent during the third quarter of this independent agent historically had contributed approximately to of our monthly gross subscriber additions 
collectively  the loss of these agents resulted in the gross subscriber additions shortfall as compared to the prior year 
subscriber churn was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we believe that our churn rate remains consistently low compared to industry average due to our high quality system performance  our commitment to quality customer service and our focused retention efforts 
the fcc mandated that wireless carriers provide for lnp in certain markets by november  and by may  in all remaining markets 
six of our thirty seven markets were included in the november  deadline 
lnp did not have a material impact on subscriber churn in arpu was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
arpu reflects the average amount billed to subscribers based on rate plan offerings 
arpu is exclusive of service revenue credits made to retain existing subscribers of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for more details regarding our calculation of arpu  refer to reconciliation of non gaap financial measures below 

table of contents we continue to focus on attracting new customers with rate plans that provide more value to the customer at a higher average customer bill 
the arpu decrease of  or  was primarily the result of a change in our rate plan mix  as many existing high arpu subscribers migrated to the unplan to take advantage of that plan s unlimited minutes for calls from the subscriber s local calling area at a lower monthly cost 
we believe that most high arpu subscribers who will migrate to the unplan have done so 
the shift in rate plan mix was largely offset by price increases 
total revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  service revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in service revenue was due primarily to growth of subscribers  partially offset by a slight decrease in arpu 
roaming revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the net increase in roaming revenue was the result of increased roaming minutes of use resulting from the expansion of our network  the implementation of roaming agreements with such carriers as cingular wireless and the overall growth in the wireless industry  partially offset by any reductions in roaming rates contractually agreed to with other carriers 
roaming minutes for the year ended december  were billion  which represents a increase over the year ended december  equipment revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  equipment revenue includes the revenue earned in the sale of a handset or handset accessories to new and existing subscribers 
in addition  equipment revenue includes the fair value of handsets received from a subscriber in a handset upgrade transaction 
the equipment revenue increase was due primarily to an increase in handset sales to existing subscribers and an increase in the sale of excess subscriber returned handsets to third party wholesalers and resellers 
in addition  on july   we adopted eitf accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which requires that the total revenue proceeds of a transaction be allocated to the associated deliverables 
when equipment cost exceeds equipment revenue  referred to as equipment margin  in a subscriber activation transaction  the activation fee collected up to the amount of the equipment margin  is recognized immediately as equipment revenue 
previously  this activation revenue was deferred and recognized over the average life of a subscriber 
cost of service excluding amortization  depreciation and non cash compensation was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was related to a higher volume of traffic on our network driven by rate plan offerings and subscriber growth as well as higher roaming minutes of use 
cost of service as a percentage of service revenue was and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase of was primarily attributable to increased costs to operate our gsm gprs network and to expand and maintain our wireless network to support an increased number of minutes of use on our tdma network 
cost of equipment was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  cost of equipment includes the cost associated with the sale of a handset or handset accessories to new and existing subscribers 
the cost of equipment increase was due primarily to an increase in handset sales to existing subscribers  as well as increased sales of excess subscriber returned handsets to third party wholesalers and resellers 
selling  general and administrative expenses excluding amortization  depreciation and non cash compensation were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  selling expenses decreased by million or  primarily due to lower fixed costs resulting from the streamlining of our operations during the first quarter of as well as decreased spending on advertising and promotions in general and administrative expenses decreased by million or  primarily due to decreased bad debt expense  which was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of service revenue was and 
table of contents for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease of is primarily attributable to increased customer care efficiency and focused collection efforts  which controlled bad debt expense  and increased leverage of other fixed costs 
cpga was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the cpga increase of  or  was primarily the result of increased equipment margin due to equipment promotions we offered and decreased leverage on fixed acquisition costs such as store rent expense and sales and marketing overhead costs  as the result of lower gross subscriber additions  partially offset by the streamlining of our operations in the first quarter of retail customer service expenses and the equipment margin on handsets sold to existing subscribers  including handset upgrade transactions  are excluded  as these costs are incurred specifically for existing subscribers 
for more details regarding our calculation of cpga  refer to reconciliation of non gaap financial measures below 
termination benefits and other related costs were million for the year ended december  these expenses  which consisted primarily of severance and relocation costs  resulted from the streamlining of our operations during january there were no termination benefits and other related costs for the year ended december  non cash compensation expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  non cash compensation represents the amortization of restricted stock  valued at the date of grant  over the applicable vesting period 
the increase is attributable to the vesting of an increased number of restricted shares of our class a common stock awarded to management in prior years 
the increase in the number of vested restricted shares was primarily the result of the acceleration of a portion of our retired chief operating officer s restricted shares in accordance with his retirement agreement 
depreciation and amortization expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase relates primarily to increased depreciation expense due to the growth in our depreciable asset base resulting from capital expenditures

accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
we had a weighted average interest rate of for the year ended december   on our average borrowings under our former and current bank credit facility and our average obligation for our senior and subordinated debt  compared with the weighted average interest rate for the year ended december  other expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease of million  or  relates primarily to a decrease in the loss on our former interest rate swap derivative instruments  which were extinguished in june of loss on derivative instruments was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents debt extinguishment costs were million for the year ended december  these expenses  which consisted primarily of tender offer premium  tender offer fees and the write off of deferred financing costs  resulted from the repurchase of million aggregate principal amount of our subordinated notes and repayment of all outstanding borrowings under our former bank credit facility 
there were no debt extinguishment costs for the year ended december  interest and other income was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to lower average interest rates on lower average cash balances and short term investments 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to a non cash tax adjustment in the first quarter of to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  as we are no longer able to reasonably estimate the period of reversal  if any  for deferred tax liabilities related to licensing costs as the result of the adoption of sfas no 
we will continue to incur deferred tax expense as additional deferred tax liabilities associated with the amortization of the tax basis of our fcc licenses are incurred 
net loss was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net loss decrease of million  or resulted primarily from the items discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources the construction of our network and the marketing and distribution of wireless communications products and services have required  and will continue to require  substantial capital 
capital outlays have included license acquisition costs  capital expenditures for network construction  funding of operating cash flow losses and other working capital costs  debt service and financing fees and expenses 
we believe that cash on hand and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our projected capital requirements through although we estimate that these funds will be sufficient to finance our continued growth  we may have additional capital requirements  which could be substantial  for future upgrades and advances in new technology 
if necessary  we may need to access external sources of capital including the issuance of public equity or debt securities 
our need to obtain additional cash from external sources will be impacted by our ability to reduce costs and to continue to achieve subscriber and revenue growth 
capital needs we currently anticipate that our future capital needs will principally consist of funds required for capital expenditures to expand and enhance our network  capital expenditures related to increased retail distribution and information systems functionality  operating expenses related to our network  operating expenses related to the acquisition and retention of subscribers  debt service requirements related to our long term debt and capital lease obligations  potential material increases in the cost of compliance with regulatory mandates  and other general corporate expenditures 
we expect capital expenditures and the acquisition of fcc licenses  which were made historically to enhance and expand our wireless network in order to increase capacity and to satisfy subscriber needs and competitive requirements  to increase during as a result of our planned acquisition of urban for approximately million as well as capital required for the integration of our newly acquired north carolina and puerto rico markets and the upgrade of our network capacity and service quality to support 
table of contents our anticipated subscriber needs and growth 
we estimate that capital expenditures will be approximately million to million for capital resources as of december   our capital resources available to fund operations were comprised of approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and million of short term investments 
historically  we have met the cash needs of our business principally by raising capital from issuances of debt and equity securities 
to the extent we can generate sufficient cash flow from our operating activities  we will be able to use less of our available liquidity and will have less  if any  need to raise capital from the capital markets 
to the extent we generate lower cash flow from our operating activities  we will be required to use more of our available liquidity to fund operations or raise additional capital from the capital markets 
we may be unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms  if at all 
our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon  among other things the amount of revenue we are able to generate from our customers  the amount of operating expenses required to provide our services  the cost of acquiring and retaining customers  including the subsidies we incur to provide handsets to both our new and existing customers  and our ability to continue to grow our customer base 
short term investments 
our short term investments consist of auction rate securities  which had a book value and a fair value of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
auction rate securities are securities with an underlying component of a long term debt or an equity instrument 
these auction rate securities trade or mature on a shorter term than the underlying instrument based on an auction bid that resets the interest rate of the security 
the auction or reset dates occur at intervals that are typically less than three months  which provides high liquidity to otherwise longer term investments 
we had previously classified our auction rate securities as cash equivalents 
in  we reclassified auction rate securities from cash equivalents to short term investments because the underlying instruments have original maturity dates exceeding three months 
these securities are classified as available for sale as the securities are not held to the maturity date of the underlying security nor are they held for sale in the near term to generate profits on short term differences in price 
prior periods have been reclassified in our consolidated financial statements to provide consistent presentation 
preferred stock 
as part of our joint venture agreement with at t wireless  we issued  shares of series a preferred stock to at t wireless pcs in on october   pursuant to the triton holdings agreement described above  at t wireless pcs surrendered to holdings all of its triton preferred stock 
in addition  at t wireless waived the payment of a previously declared million dividend on holdings series a preferred stock 
as of december   holdings did not have any preferred stock outstanding 
senior secured term loan

table of contents on november   triton pcs repurchased million principal amount of its notes and million principal amount of its notes in open market transactions for aggregate cash consideration of approximately million  representing principal repurchase consideration plus accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date 
in connection with the note repurchase  we recognized approximately million of gain on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss 
we may from time to time seek to retire our outstanding debt securities through cash purchases and or exchanges for other securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
in connection with the consummation of the triton holdings agreement and the exchange agreement with cingular wireless and at t wireless  we created four new subsidiaries to carry out the exchange transaction and to hold the north carolina and puerto rico assets acquired from at t wireless 
in addition  triton received at t wireless interest in affiliate license co  llc  which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of triton pcs 
our new million senior secured term loan requires all of triton pcs domestic subsidiaries  other than triton pcs property company llc and triton pcs license company llc  to guarantee triton s obligations under the new agreement 
pursuant to triton pcs indentures for its notes  its notes and its notes  any subsidiary of triton pcs that guarantees triton pcs debt under a senior secured term loan must also guarantee triton pcs debt obligations under its indentures 
accordingly  on november  and january   triton s new subsidiaries  aws network newco  llc  suncom wireless international llc  suncom wireless puerto rico operating company llc  triton network newco  llc and affiliate license co  llc 
executed supplemental indentures with the bank of new york and became guarantors of triton pcs notes  notes and notes 
interest rate swap agreements 
during  triton pcs was a party to five interest rate swap derivatives  having an aggregate notional amount of approximately million 
triton has historically utilized interest rate swap agreements to manage changes in market conditions related to interest rate payments on its fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
in the second half of  we terminated our swap agreements for aggregate cash consideration of approximately million 
as of december   triton pcs was not a party to any interest rate swap arrangements 
credit ratings 
our credit ratings impact our ability to obtain short and long term financing and the cost of such financing 
in determining our credit ratings  the rating agencies consider a number of factors  including our profitability  operating cash flow  total debt outstanding  interest requirements  liquidity needs and availability of liquidity 
other factors considered may include our business strategy  the condition of our industry and our position within the industry 
although we understand that these are among the factors considered by the rating agencies  each agency might calculate and weigh each factor differently 
a rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold a security  and ratings are subject to revision at any time by the assigning agency

cash used by investing activities was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash used by investing activities was primarily related to a net decrease of million in auction rate securities sales and a decrease in the net repayment from lafayette  a non consolidated entity  of million offset partially by a decrease in capital expenditures of million and a decrease in fcc license acquisitions of million

in addition  net drawdowns on our credit facility decreased by million as compared to the year ended december  these decreases in cash provided by financing activities were partially offset by proceeds of million received from the issuance of our senior notes during contractual obligations and commercial commitments the table below sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of future contractual payments for our contractual obligations as of december  these disclosures are also included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  and the relevant footnotes are cross referenced in the table below

reconciliation of non gaap financial measures we utilize certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with gaap  to assess our financial performance 
a non gaap financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company s financial performance that i excludes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts  that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of income or statement of cash flows  or ii includes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts  that are excluded from the comparable measure so calculated and presented 
the discussion of each non gaap financial measure we use in this report appears above under results of operations 
a brief description of the calculation of each measure is included where the particular measure is first discussed 
our method of computation may or may not be 
table of contents comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
the following tables reconcile our non gaap financial measures with our financial statements presented in accordance with gaap 
year ended december  average revenue per user arpu dollars in thousands  except arpu service revenue subscriber retention credits revenue not generated by wireless subscribers adjusted service revenue average subscribers arpu we believe arpu  which calculates the average service revenue billed to an individual subscriber  is a useful measure to evaluate our past billable service revenue and to assist in forecasting our future billable service revenue 
arpu is exclusive of service revenue credits made to retain existing subscribers and revenue not generated by wireless subscribers 
service revenue credits are discretionary reductions of the amount billed to a subscriber 
we have no contractual obligation to issue these credits  therefore  arpu reflects the amount subscribers have contractually agreed to pay us based on their specific usage pattern 
revenue not generated by wireless subscribers  which consists of universal service fund program revenue  is excluded from our calculation of arpu  as this revenue does not reflect amounts billed to subscribers 
arpu is calculated by dividing service revenue  exclusive of service revenue credits made to existing subscribers and revenue not generated by wireless subscribers  by our average subscriber base for the respective period 
for quarterly periods  average subscribers is calculated by adding subscribers at the beginning of the quarter to subscribers at the end of the quarter and dividing by two  for year to date periods  average subscribers is calculated by adding the average subscriber amount calculated for the quarterly periods during the period and dividing by the number of quarters in the period 
as a result of the acquisition and divestiture of subscribers related to the exchange transaction during the fourth quarter of  average subscribers for this quarter was calculated by summing the average subscribers for the three months in the quarter and dividing by three 
year ended december  cost per gross addition cpga dollars in thousands  except cpga selling expenses total cost of equipment transactions with new subscribers cpga operating expenses cost of service total cost of equipment transactions with existing subscribers general and administrative expense termination benefits and other related charges non cash compensation depreciation and asset disposal amortization total operating expenses cpga operating expenses from above equipment revenue transactions with new subscribers cpga costs  net gross subscriber additions cpga 
table of contents we believe cpga is a useful measure that quantifies the incremental costs to acquire a new subscriber 
this measure also provides a gauge to compare our average acquisition costs per new subscriber to that of other wireless communication providers 
cpga is calculated by dividing the sum of equipment margin for handsets sold to new subscribers equipment revenue less cost of equipment  which costs have historically exceeded the related revenue and selling expenses related to adding new subscribers by total gross subscriber additions during the relevant period 
retail customer service expenses are excluded from cpga  as these costs are incurred specifically for existing subscribers 
relationship with lafayette communications company llc on june   lafayette in two separate transactions sold pcs licenses to us for an aggregate fair value of approximately million 
as a part of these transactions  we paid approximately million to the fcc to satisfy lafayette s outstanding obligations due to the fcc

in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements fin 
fin clarifies the application of consolidation guidance to those entities defined as variable interest entities vies  which includes  but is not limited to special purpose entities  trusts  partnerships  certain joint ventures and other legal structures  in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or there is not sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
fin applied immediately to all vies created after january  and by the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period commencing after june  for vies created prior to february  in december  the fasb issued fin r which amends and supercedes the original fin effective december  we adopted fin r 
in accordance with fin r  we have determined that triton possesses a controlling financial interest and is the primary beneficiary of lafayette s operating activities 
as a result  we have consolidated lafayette s operations with our financials statements 
as of december   triton s consolidated balance sheet included a non controlling interest in variable interest entity of approximately  related to the of lafayette not owned by triton   of cash and million of fcc deposits related to lafayette 
lafayette did not incur any operating income or loss for the year ended december  new accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued the revised statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 share based payment fas r  which addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the entity or b liabilities that are based on the fair 
table of contents value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
this statement eliminates the ability to account for employee share based payment transactions using accounting principles board opinion no 
and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using the grant date fair value based method 
this statement will be effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  fas r applies to all awards granted or modified after the statement s effective date 
in addition  compensation cost for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding on the statement s effective date shall be recognized on or after the effective date  as the related services are rendered  based on the awards grant date fair value as previously calculated for the pro forma disclosure under fas as we currently use the grant date fair value based method to account for our restricted stock awards  we do not expect this statement to have a material effect on our financial statements or our results of operations 
on november   the fasb issued fas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb  chapter 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect this statement to have a material effect on our financial statements or our results of operations 
on december   the fasb issued fas no 
 exchanges of non monetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 

fas amends apb opinion no 
 accounting for non monetary transactions 
the amendments made by fas are based on the principle that exchanges of non monetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a general exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
the provisions in fas are effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not expect this statement to have a material effect on our financial statements or our results of operations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are highly leveraged and  as a result  our cash flows and earnings are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
our debt obligations are us dollar denominated 
our market risk  therefore  is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
as of december   our debt can be categorized as follows in thousands fixed interest rates senior notes senior subordinated notes subject to interest rate fluctuations senior secured term loan our interest rate risk management program focuses on minimizing exposure to interest rate movements  setting an optimal mixture of floating and fixed rate debt and minimizing liquidity risk 
historically  we have selectively entered into interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate exposure 
during the year ended december   we terminated all five of our interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million for aggregate cash consideration of approximately million 
our cash and cash equivalents consist of short term assets having initial maturities of three months or less  and our investments consist of auction rate securities with maturities of one year or less 
while these investments are subject to a degree of interest rate risk  this risk is not considered to be material relative to our overall investment income position 
if market rates rise over the remaining term of the senior secured term loan  we would realize increased annual interest expense of approximately million for each basis point increase in rates 
if market rates decline over the remaining term of the senior secured term loan  we would realize decreased annual interest expense of approximately million for each basis point decrease in rates
