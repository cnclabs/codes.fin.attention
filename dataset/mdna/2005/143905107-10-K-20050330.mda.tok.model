item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate two types of businesses funeral homes  which account for approximately of our revenues  and cemeteries  which account for approximately of our revenues 
funeral homes are principally a service business that provide funeral services burial and cremation and sell related merchandise  such as caskets and urns 
cemeteries are primarily a sales business that sells real estate grave sites and mausoleums and related merchandise such as markers and memorials 
substantially all administrative activities are conducted in our home office in houston  texas 
factors affecting our funeral operating results include the number of deaths in the markets we serve  whether we gain or lose market share relative to our competitors in the markets we operate  the price that we sell our services and merchandise  and the cost of providing services  primarily the salaries and benefits expense related to our professional and support staff  and the cost of merchandise 
in simple terms  volume and price are the two variables that affect funeral revenues 
the average revenue per contract is influenced by the mix of traditional and cremation services because our average cremation service revenue is approximately of the average revenue earned from a traditional funeral service during the year ended december  funeral homes have a high fixed cost structure 
thus  small changes in revenues  up or down  may cause disproportionate changes to our profitability 
during the second half of  we implemented several significant changes in our funeral operations designed to improve operating and financial results by growing market share and increasing profitability 
we introduced a more decentralized  entrepreneurial and local operating model 
at the same time  we introduced operating and financial standards developed from our best funeral operations 
the new operating model and standards focus on the key drivers of a successful funeral operation  organized around three primary areas market share  people and operating and financial metrics 
a portion of local management s compensation is variable based on their success as measured against these standards 
we first began operating under this model in we have experienced benefits from the new model during the last half of for example  better merchandising  the implementation of packages in certain locations and updates to our pricing resulted in a strong increase in the average revenue per service 
we also believe that we have made better decisions in hiring new staff  training existing staff and managing the workload which resulted in lower salaries and benefits costs 
we expect that by focusing on the key drivers  we will increase market share and improve profitability over time 
the cemetery operating results are affected by the success of our sales organization as currently approximately of our cemetery revenues relate to preneed sales of interment rights 
we believe that changes in the level of consumer confidence a measure of whether consumers will spend for discretionary items also affects the amount of preneed sales 
approximately of our cemetery revenues are currently attributable to investment earnings on trust funds and finance charges on installment contracts 
changes in the capital markets and interest rates affect this component of our cemetery revenues 
from to  we accumulated a large amount of debt and contingent obligations from acquisitions 
our business strategy during the last four years focused on increasing operating cash flow and improving our financial condition by reducing debt to lower our interest expense and improve our credit profile 
we have not been actively seeking businesses to acquire since  instead we have been focused on selling underperforming businesses and reducing our debt 
from september  when we initiated a process to identify underperforming businesses  to december   we sold funeral homes and cemeteries along with parcels of excess real estate 
we used the proceeds of approximately million from those sales to reduce our debt 
we have reduced our debt and contingent obligations by approximately million during the period january  through december  during january we refinanced our senior debt by issuing million of senior notes due in this refinancing represented a milestone 
the refinancing was the culmination of the effort to reaccess the capital markets and to extend the maturities of our senior debt and to gain the flexibility to reinvest our free cash flow in our core business 
we can now use the net cash proceeds from the offering and our free cash flow to grow our company through selective acquisitions 
we also intend to amend our existing bank credit facility  which initially will not be drawn on 
we expect the amended credit facility to be secured and contain more favorable covenants 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  realization of accounts receivable  intangible assets  property and equipment and deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience  third party data and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these considerations form the basis for making judgments about the amount and timing of revenues and expenses  the carrying value of assets and the recorded amounts of liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change 
historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future performance  because there can be no assurance the margins  operating income and net earnings as a percentage of revenues will be sustained consistently from year to year 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements presented herewith  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
funeral and cemetery operations we record the sales of funeral merchandise and services when the funeral service is performed 
sales of cemetery interment rights are recorded as revenue in accordance with the retail land sales provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
this method generally provides for the recognition of revenue in the period in which the customer s cumulative payments exceed of the contract price related to the real estate 
costs related to the sales of interment rights  which include property and other costs related to cemetery development activities  are charged to operations using the specific identification method in the period in which the sale of the interment right is recognized as revenue 
revenue from the sales of cemetery merchandise and services are recognized in the period in which the merchandise is delivered or the service is performed 
revenues to be recognized from the delivery of merchandise and performance of services related to contracts that were acquired in acquisitions are typically lower than those originated by the company and are likely to exceed the cash collected from the contract and received from the trust at maturity 
allowances for customer cancellations  refunds and bad debts are provided at the date that the sale is recognized as revenue based on our historical experience 
in addition  we monitor changes in delinquency rates and provide additional bad debt and cancellation reserves when warranted 
when preneed funeral services and merchandise are funded through third party insurance policies  we earn a commission on the sale of the policies 
insurance commissions are recognized as revenues when the commission is no longer subject to refund  which is usually one year after the policy is issued 
deferred obtaining costs deferred obtaining costs consist of sales commissions and other direct related costs of originating preneed sales contracts 
these costs are deferred and amortized into funeral and cemetery costs and expenses over the period we expect to perform the services or deliver the merchandise covered by the preneed contracts 
the periods over which the costs are recognized are based on actuarial statistics for the actual contracts we hold  provided by a third party administrator 
goodwill and other intangible assets the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired  as determined by management in transactions accounted for as purchases  is recorded as goodwill 
many of the acquired funeral homes have provided high quality service to families for generations 
the resulting loyalty often represents a substantial portion of the value of a funeral business 
goodwill is typically not associated with or recorded for the cemetery businesses 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we discontinued amortizing goodwill as of january   and instead we review the carrying value of goodwill at least annually on reporting units aggregated geographically to determine if facts and circumstances exist which would suggest that this intangible asset might be carried in excess of fair value 
fair value is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows of the businesses in each reporting unit at the company s weighted average cost of capital less debt allocable to the reporting unit and by reference to recent sales transactions of similar businesses 
the calculation of fair value can vary dramatically with changes in estimates of the number of future services performed  inflation in costs and the company s cost of capital  which is impacted by long term interest rates 
if impairment is indicated  then an adjustment will be made to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill to fair value 
income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated us federal income tax return and separate income tax returns in the states in which we operate 
we record deferred taxes for temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  note 
the company records a valuation allowance to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets for which realization is uncertain 
management reviews the valuation allowance at the end of each quarter and makes adjustments if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
stock compensation plans the company has stock based employee compensation plans in the form of stock option and employee stock purchase plans  which are more fully described in note the company accounts for stock based compensation under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees whereby no compensation expense is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and has adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values and the pro forma disclosure alternative is no longer allowable under statement r 
the revised standard is effective for public entities in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june   which for the company will be the third quarter of fiscal ending september  the company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of statement r  which will result in additional pre tax compensation expense beginning in the third quarter of for remaining unvested stock options  any future stock option grants and the employee stock purchase plan 
management believes that the adoption of sfas r will provide results similar to the pro forma disclosure for sfas note we have also granted restricted stock to certain officers of the company  which vest over a period of four years 
these shares are valued at the dates granted and the value is charged to operations as the shares vest 
accounting changes and recently issued accounting standards impairment of investments in march  the fasb reached consensus on the guidance provided by emerging issues task force issue eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the guidance is applicable to debt and equity securities that are within the scope of fasb statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
eitf specifies that an impairment would be considered other than temporary unless a the investor has the ability and intent to hold an investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient for the recovery of the fair value up to or beyond the cost of the investment and b evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence of the contrary 
eitf was scheduled to be effective for reporting periods ending after june  the measurement and recognition provisions relating to debt and equity securities have been delayed until the fasb issues additional guidance 
the disclosure requirements continue to be effective in annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after june  we adopted the disclosure provisions during the period ended june  the adoption of the measurement and recognition provisions will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements  result of operations or liquidity of the company 
impairment of long lived assets except as noted for goodwill and deferred obtaining costs  the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the net asset may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future service potential to the company are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less estimated cost to sell 
the revenues and expenses  as well as gains  losses and impairments  from those assets are reported in the discontinued operations section of the consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented which represents a change in classification to our previously issued consolidated financial statements in prior filings including our annual reports on form k for the years reflected in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
goodwill the effect of sfas no 
on the company  which was adopted as of the beginning of  included eliminating the amortization of goodwill  the identifying reporting units for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill and the testing for impairments of goodwill on an annual basis 
the company performs an annual review of goodwill by comparing the fair value of the company s reporting units funeral home businesses by region to the carrying value of the reporting units 
no impairment was indicated for consolidation of variable interest entities the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 as revised  fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
this interpretation clarifies the circumstances in which certain entities that do not have equity investors with a controlling financial interest must be consolidated by its sponsor 
the company implemented fin r as of march   which resulted  for financial reporting purposes  in the consolidation of the company s preneed and perpetual care trust funds 
the investments of such trust funds have been reported at market value and the company s future obligations to deliver merchandise and services have been reported at estimated settlement amounts 
the company has also recognized the non controlling financial interests of third parties in the trust funds 
there was no cumulative effect of an accounting change recognized by the company as a result of the implementation of fin r 
the implementation of fin r affected certain accounts on the company s balance sheet beginning march  as described below  however  it did not affect cash flow  net income or the manner in which the company recognizes and reports revenues 
although fin r requires consolidation of preneed and perpetual care trusts  it does not change the legal relationships among the trusts  the company and its customers 
in the case of preneed trusts  the customers are the legal beneficiaries 
in the case of perpetual care trusts  the company does not have a right to access the corpus in the perpetual care trusts 
for these reasons  the company has recognized non controlling interests in our financial statements to reflect third party interests in these consolidated trust funds 
both the preneed trusts and the cemetery perpetual care trusts hold investments in marketable securities which have been classified as available for sale 
the investments are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses allocated to non controlling interests in trust investments in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
unrealized gains and losses attributable to the company  but that have not been earned through the performance of services or delivery of merchandise is allocated to deferred revenues 
also beginning march   the company recognizes realized income  gains and losses of the preneed trusts and cemetery perpetual care trusts 
the company recognizes a corresponding expense equal to the realized earnings of these trusts attributable to the non controlling interest holders 
when such earnings attributable to the company have not been earned through the performance of services or delivery of merchandise  the company will record such earnings as deferred revenue 
for preneed trusts  the company recognizes as revenues amounts attributed to the non controlling interest holders and the company  including accumulated realized earnings  when the contracted services have been performed and merchandise delivered 
for cemetery perpetual care trusts  the company recognizes investment earnings in cemetery revenues when such earnings are realized and distributable 
such earnings are intended to defray cemetery maintenance costs incurred by the company 
also  the company was required to deconsolidate carriage services capital trust the trust  a trust established in to issue redeemable convertible preferred securities 
the company s obligation to the trust consists of convertible junior subordinated debentures 
the preferred securities of the trust were previously classified as temporary equity in the consolidated balance sheet 
as a result of deconsolidating the trust  the company now reports its obligation to the trust  the convertible junior subordinated debentures  as a long term liability 
selected income and operational data the following table sets forth certain income statement data for carriage expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the periods presented year ended december  total revenues  net total gross profit general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense the following table sets forth the number of funeral homes and cemeteries owned and operated by carriage for the periods presented year ended december  funeral homes at beginning of period acquisitions divestitures  mergers or closures of existing funeral homes funeral homes at end of period cemeteries at beginning of period acquisitions divestitures cemeteries at end of period the following is a discussion of carriage s results of operations for   and the term same store or existing operations refers to funeral homes and cemeteries owned and operated for the entirety of each period being compared 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following is a discussion of the company s results of operations for the years ended december  and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 
excluding the reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance of million or per diluted share  the percent improvement from to per share was attributable to lower interest expense and improvements in both funeral and cemetery profitability 
net income  which includes the effect of discontinued operations  totaled per diluted share per share excluding the reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance equal to per share compared to per share for a significant portion of the decrease is attributable to impairment charges before taxes of million  equal to per diluted share  net of gains totaling million pretax  equal to per diluted share  from the sales in of three funeral home businesses 
funeral home segment 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding the net revenues and gross profit of the company from the funeral home operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  for purposes of our discussion  the revenue and gross profit of our businesses identified to be sold are included in the same store classification up to the quarter prior to their sale 
year ended december  change amount percent dollars in thousands total same store revenue less businesses held for sale preneed insurance commissions revenue revenues from continuing operations revenues from discontinued operations total same store gross profit less businesses held for sale preneed insurance commissions revenue gross profit from continuing operations gross profit from discontinued operations not meaningful funeral same store revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  when compared to the year ended december   as we experienced an increase of to  in the average revenue per service for those existing operations and the number of services declined by  or 
cremation services represented of the number of funeral services during  compared to for total funeral same store gross profit for the year ended december  increased million  or from  as a result of the increase in same store revenues given the predominately fixed cost structure of our businesses 
funeral costs and expenses remained constant from cemetery segment 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding the net revenues and gross profit of the company from the cemetery operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  year ended december  change amount percent dollars in thousands total same store revenue less businesses held for sale revenues from continuing operations revenues from discontinued operations total same store gross profit less businesses held for sale gross profit from continuing operations gross profit from discontinued operations not meaningful no cemetery businesses were acquired or sold during the two years  one cemetery is held for sale 
cemetery same store revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  over the year ended december   and cemetery same store gross profit increased million  or  over revenues from preneed interment sales increased million 
though the number of interments sold on a preneed basis remained the same  the average price per space increased 
continuing gross margin decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  due to higher sales discounts  bad debts and facilities and grounds costs 
higher sales discounts on property negatively impacted revenues and gross profit by million year over year 
bad debts were million higher than the prior year and facilities and grounds expenses increased million  primarily due to higher property taxes  insurance and utilities 
other 
general and administrative expenses increased million for the year ended december  primarily because included higher depreciation on computer and software additions during the last months and higher professional fees  a large portion of which related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of other charges consist primarily of a pretax charge of million to write off capitalized costs of a cemetery accounting system development project that the company terminated 
included in other income for are pretax gains totaling million from the sales of real estate and other assets 
interest expense for the year ended december  declined million  or  compared to the year ended december  while the debt outstanding has decreased by approximately million  or  during  we are not reporting a proportional decrease in interest expense because the current year expense is negatively impacted by higher loan fees and compound interest on the deferred interest on the convertible subordinated debentures 
income taxes 
the company recorded income taxes for continuing operations at the effective rate of percent and percent excluding the effect of the change in the valuation allowance for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for federal income tax reporting purposes  carriage has had net operating loss carryforwards to offset federal taxable income in and carriage also has approximately million of state net operating loss carryforwards 
when the company incurred restructuring costs and write downs in late and proceeded to dispose of low performing businesses  it could not be assured that it would generate enough future taxable income to utilize the tax benefits created by the tax losses on asset sales 
to acknowledge this uncertainty  the company recorded a valuation allowance to offset these tax benefits until such time that it could be determined it would be more likely than not the company would be able to realize the tax benefits 
the company recognized tax benefits related to the change in the valuation allowance related to its deferred tax assets of million and million in and  respectively 
the remaining valuation allowance at december  is attributable to the deferred tax asset related to the state operating losses 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  funeral home segment 
the following sets forth certain information regarding carriage s net revenues and gross profit from our funeral home operations during the years ended december  and year ended december  change amount percent dollars in thousands total same store revenue acquired less businesses held for sale preneed insurance commissions revenue revenues from continuing operations revenues from discontinued operations total same store gross profit acquired less businesses held for sale preneed insurance commissions revenue gross profit from continuing operations gross profit from discontinued operations not meaningful funeral same store revenues for the year ended december  were less when compared to the year ended december   as we experienced a decrease of in the number of funeral service contracts from  to  and an increase of in the average revenue per contract from  to  for those existing operations 
the decline in the number of funeral service contracts of was due in part to the decline in the number of deaths of in compared to based on statistics published by the cdc  as adjusted for non reporting cities 
we also believe that we lost market share in certain areas based on our analysis of obituary reports for those markets 
approximately of the funeral services were cremation services compared to in the average revenue per cremation services increased compared to the change in mix from traditional to cremation services resulted in a decline of million in revenue for compared to of the funeral services performed during and  approximately and  respectively  were prearranged 
though total funeral revenues including discontinued operations declined by million  funeral costs and expenses actually increased by million  resulting in a decline in gross profit including discontinued operations of million 
from an operational perspective  the funeral business is a relatively fixed cost business 
if variable costs had remained constant as a percentage of net revenues  the million reduction in revenue would have been associated with a reduction in cost of approximately million to million 
the negative cost and expense variance was due primarily to increases in merchandise costs  bad debts and property casualty and general liability insurance 
merchandise costs were approximately million higher as vendors increased their prices to carriage at the beginning of at a rate higher than the company was able to increase its prices to the public 
bad debts were million higher than because the company realized some significant recoveries during from a centralized collection process installed in property casualty and general liability insurance costs increased million due to higher premium costs and claims 
cemetery segment 
the following sets forth certain information regarding carriage s net revenues and gross profit from cemetery operations for the years ended december  and year ended december  change amount percent dollars in thousands total same store revenues less businesses held for sale revenues from continuing operations revenues from discontinued operations total same store gross profit less businesses held for sale gross profit from continuing operations gross profit from discontinued operations not meaningful no cemetery businesses were acquired or sold during the two years  one cemetery is held for sale 
the higher cemetery net revenues resulted in part from a million increase in at need revenues as a result of an increase in the average value per contract of from to  though the volume of at need contracts declined from  to  we also experienced an increase in preneed property sales of million  primarily the result of a increase in the number of preneed contracts written from  to  the average preneed contract value declined from  to  these increases were offset in part by million less trust income and million less in deliveries of previously prearranged merchandise and services 
cemetery gross profit increased on a year over year basis primarily due to million less bad debt expense in other 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased slightly from lower million lease expense from the buyout of a computer lease obligation in early was mitigated in part by higher million depreciation expense 
higher overall salaries and wages in offset the million officer termination cost in higher legal fees and franchise taxes in totaling million compared to million incurred for professional fees related to a change in tax accounting methods 
interest expense for the year ended december  declined million compared to the year ended primarily because outstanding debt declined period over period 
cash flow from operations and proceeds from the sales of business assets have provided the source of funds to reduce the debt outstanding during and during  total outstanding debt was reduced by million 
reductions in interest rates during and and the expiration of a floating for fixed interest rate swap in may also contributed to a lesser degree in reducing interest expense 
income taxes 
the company recorded income taxes at the effective rate of excluding the affect of the change in valuation allowance for the years ended december  and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the slightly lower tax rate in  compared to  is based on the utilization of certain state loss carryforwards 
because of the ability to use the net operating loss to offset taxable income and the timing of when revenue and expenses are recognized for tax purposes  we did not pay federal income taxes in and liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december   representing a decrease of million from december  it has been carriage s practice to apply available cash against its revolving line of credit  described below  to minimize interest expense 
if the company needs cash for working capital or investment purposes  it may draw on the line of credit so long as the company is in compliance with the loan covenants and committed funds are available 
for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million for the year ended december   in part because pretax income from continuing operations increased million 
the current year period also benefited from the deferral of interest payments in the amount of million on the convertible junior subordinated debenture compared to million in the prior year period 
additionally  the cost of originating preneed contracts declined million compared to the prior year 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to cash used in the amount of million for the year ended december  cash used for capital expenditures declined million from million in to million in the majority of our cashflow in was used to reduce debt 
the outstanding principal of our senior debt at december  totaled million and consisted of million in aggregate principal amount under our existing senior notes  million outstanding under our existing unsecured credit facility  and million in acquisition indebtedness and capital lease obligations 
additionally  million in letters of credit have been issued under the existing unsecured credit facility and were outstanding at december  our existing unsecured credit facility  as amended  provides for borrowings up to million and matures in march interest is payable at either prime rate plus or a rate indexed to libor at the company s option 
currently  the libor option is set at libor plus basis points 
the company s credit facility was amended subsequent to year end to permit the issuance of senior notes 
in addition  the company entered into a letter of commitment with bank of america  its lead lender  for a million senior secured credit facility 
the senior secured credit facility would mature five years from the closing date  would be secured by the company s assets including certain funeral home real property and would include financial covenants and limitations on stock redemptions  dividends and acquisitions 
the commitment is subject to certain conditions precedent to closing and completion of definitive documentation 
in january  the company issued million of senior notes due in the proceeds from these notes were used to refinance all of the senior debt  bring current the deferred distributions on the convertible junior subordinated debentures and the tides  and for general corporate purposes 
in connection with the early retirement of the senior debt  the company made a required make whole payment of million in the form of additional interest and recorded a charge to write off million of unamortized loan costs 
these charges equal million after tax  or per diluted share  and will be reported in the first quarter of the following table sets forth the consolidated capitalization as of december  on an actual basis and on an as adjusted basis to give effect to the million offering of senior notes due in and the transactions paying off our senior debt and accrued interest 
as of december  actual as adjusted in millions senior debt existing unsecured credit facility existing senior notes new senior notes acquisition debt capital leases total senior debt subordinated debt subordinated debt to affiliate deferred interest total subordinated debt total debt total stockholders equity total capitalization the net proceeds of this offering  which were approximately million after deducting the initial purchasers discount and offering expenses  were used to pay in full the principal  accrued but unpaid interest  and make whole payments on the existing senior notes  repay all outstanding borrowings under our existing unsecured credit facility  pay the cumulative deferred interest on the subordinated debt to affiliate current  and fund general corporate purposes 
subsequent to the above described refinancing transactions  we will enjoy the extended maturity of our debt  a more flexible covenant package and the continuing right to defer distributions payable in respect of the tides for up to five years 
notwithstanding our ability to defer payment of distributions in respect of the tides  we resumed cash payments of interest on the tides on march   which aggregate approximately million on an annual basis 
while we will have the ability to borrow additional amounts under our amended senior secured credit facility  our intention is to fund anticipated capital expenditures  acquisitions  if any  and other operating requirements from existing cash balances and cash flow from operations 
a total of million was outstanding on december  on our convertible junior subordinated debentures 
amounts outstanding under the debentures are payable to the company s affiliate trust  carriage services capital trust  bear interest at and mature in substantially all the assets of the trust consist of the convertible junior subordinated debentures of the company 
the trust issued million shares of tides 
the rights of the debentures are functionally equivalent to those of the tides 
the convertible junior subordinated debentures payable to the affiliated trust and the tides each contain a provision for the deferral of interest payments and distributions for up to consecutive quarters 
during the period in which distribution payments are deferred  distributions will continue to accumulate at the annual rate 
also  the deferred distributions themselves accumulate distributions at the annual rate of and are recorded as a liability 
during the deferral period  we are prohibited from paying dividends on the common stock or repurchasing its common stock  subject to limited exceptions 
in complying with the conditions of our existing unsecured credit facility  we began deferring interest payments on the subordinated debentures payable to our affiliated trust 
as a result  cash distributions on the tides have been deferred and recorded as a liability  beginning with the september  payment 
the condition was imposed by the lenders to ensure that we had sufficient available borrowings under our existing unsecured credit facility to retire the series a maturities of the existing senior notes in july and to accommodate the two commitment reductions in contractual obligations the following table summarizes our balance sheet liabilities to make future payments as of december  where appropriate we have indicated the footnote to our annual consolidated financial statements where additional information is available 
payments by period in millions note reference total after years long term debt capital lease obligations convertible junior subordinated debenture a deferred interest on convertible junior subordinated debenture total contractual obligations a matures in off balance sheet arrangements the following table summarizes our off balance sheet arrangements as of december  where appropriate we have indicated the footnote to our annual consolidated financial statements where additional information is available 
payments by period in millions note reference total after years operating leases interest on refinanced long term debt a noncompete agreements consulting agreements software agreements executive management agreements total contractual cash obligations a calculated on the million of senior notes after january the obligations related to our off balance sheet arrangements are significant to our future liquidity  however  although we can provide no assurances  we anticipate that these obligations will be funded from cash provided from our operating activities 
if we are not able to meet these obligations with cash provided for by our operating activities  we may be required to access the capital markets or draw down on our credit facilities 
additionally  we are party to a variety of contractual agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters 
these contracts primarily relate to the purchase or sale of business assets  commercial contracts and operating leases and arose through representations and warranties eg  ownership of assets or environmental matters 
the terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined 
related party transactions as an incentive  the company entered into arrangements with two former owners  both of which have served as directors during the past three years  to pay them each of the amount by which the annual field level cash flow exceeds predetermined targets on certain businesses in their respective geographic region through  with a final payment equal to a multiple of six times the average of the last three years payments 
the business purpose of the arrangements was to incentivise the individuals to provide carriage with high quality acquisition targets and to have input in the competitive strategies of those businesses post acquisition so that cash flows grow over time 
the terms were determined by reference to similar arrangements within the death care industry 
the incentives earned by the two individuals totaled approximately   and  for the years  and  respectively 
in connection with the acquisitions of certain funeral homes  a portion of the purchase price of each of those funeral homes was to be payable to one of the former owners referred to in the preceding paragraph based on a formula related to the annual field level cash flows subsequent to the year of acquisition 
the business purpose was to determine the final purchase prices of the acquisitions since they were expected to show strong growth in cash flow 
the terms were negotiated with the sellers  one of which later was appointed as a director of carriage 
the contingent purchase price payments paid to the director totaled  during during  the company was reimbursed for the cost of personnel and office expenses totaling approximately  from an entity in which the company owned a minority interest and one of the entity s directors is our chief executive officer 
the company sold its interest in the entity and our ceo resigned as director of the entity during seasonality the company s business can be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the death rate 
generally  the rate is higher during the winter months because the incidences of death from influenza and pneumonia are higher during this period than other periods of the year 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the results of carriage s operations 
forward looking statements in addition to historical information  this annual report contains forward looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements include any projections of earnings  revenues  asset sales  cash flow  debt levels or other financial items  any statements of the plans  strategies and objectives of management for future operation  any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance  any statements of belief  and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing 
forward looking statements may include the words may  will  estimate  intend  believe  expect  project  forecast  plan  anticipate and other similar words 
risks related to our company marketing and sales activities by existing and new competitors could cause us to lose market share and lead to lower revenues and margins 
we face competition in all of our markets 
most of our competitors are independently owned  and some are relatively recent market entrants 
certain of the recent entrants are individuals who were formerly employed by us or by our competitors and have relationships and name recognition within our markets 
as a group  independent competitors tend to be aggressive in distinguishing themselves by their independent ownership  and they promote their independence through advertising  direct mailings and personal contact 
increasing pressures from new market entrants and continued advertising and marketing by competitors in local markets could cause us to lose market share and revenues 
in addition  competitors may change the types or mix of products or services offered 
these changes may attract customers  causing us to lose market share and revenue as well as to incur costs in response to competition to vary the types or mix of products or services offered by us 
price competition could also reduce our market share or cause us to reduce prices to retain or recapture market share  either of which could reduce revenues and margins 
we have historically experienced price competition primarily from independent funeral home and cemetery operators  and from monument dealers  casket retailers  low cost funeral providers and other non traditional providers of services or products 
new market entrants tend to attempt to build market share by offering lower cost alternatives 
in the past  this price competition has resulted in our losing market share in some markets 
in other markets  we have had to reduce prices thereby reducing profit margins in order to retain or recapture market share 
increased price competition in the future could further reduce revenues  profit margins and our backlog 
improved performance in our funeral segment is highly dependent upon successful execution of our standards based being the best operating model 
at the beginning of  we implemented our new standards based being the best operating model to improve and better measure performance in our funeral operations 
we developed standards according to nine criteria  each with a different weighting  designed around market share  people  and operational and financial metrics 
we also incentivise our location managing partners by giving them the opportunity to earn a fixed percentage of the field level earnings before interest taxes  depreciation and amortization based upon the number and weighting of the standards achieved 
our expectation is that  over time  the being the best operating model will result in our maintaining or improving field level margins  market share  customer satisfaction and overall financial performance  but there is no assurance that these goals will be met 
our ability to generate preneed sales depends on a number of factors  including sales incentives and local and general economic conditions 
declines in preneed sales would reduce our backlog and revenue and could reduce our future market share 
on the other hand  a significant increase in preneed sales can have a negative impact on cash flow as a result of commissions and other costs incurred without corresponding revenues 
as we have localized our preneed sales strategies  we are continuing to refine the mix of service and product offerings in both our funeral and cemetery segments  including changes in our sales commission and incentive structure 
these changes could cause us to experience declines in preneed sales in the short run 
in addition  economic conditions at the local or national level could cause declines in preneed sales either as a result of less discretionary income or lower consumer confidence 
declines in preneed cemetery property sales would reduce current revenue  and declines in other preneed sales would reduce our backlog and future revenue and could reduce future market share 
preneed sales of cemetery property and funeral and cemetery merchandise and services are generally cash flow negative initially  primarily due to the commissions paid on the sale  the portion of the sales proceeds required to be placed into trust or escrow and the terms of the particular contract such as the size of the down payment required and the length of the contract 
as a result  preneed sales reduce cash flow available for other activities  and  to the extent preneed activities are increased  cash flow will be further reduced 
earnings from and principal of trust funds and insurance contracts could be reduced by changes in financial markets 
earnings and investment gains and losses on trust funds and insurance contracts are affected by financial market conditions that are largely outside our control 
earnings are also affected by the mix of fixed income and equity securities that we choose to maintain in the funds  and we may not choose the optimal mix for any particular market condition 
declines in earnings from perpetual care trust funds would cause a decline in current revenues  while declines in earnings from other trust funds and insurance contracts could cause a decline in future cash flows and revenues 
unrealized gains and losses in the funeral trust funds and cemetery merchandise trust funds have no immediate impact on our revenues  margins  earnings or cash flow  unless the fair market value of the funds were to decline below the estimated costs to deliver the underlying products and services 
if that were to occur  we would record a charge to earnings to record the expected loss currently 
over time  gains and losses realized in the funds are allocated to underlying preneed contracts and affect the amount of the trust fund earnings to be recognized when we deliver the underlying product or service 
depending on conditions in the financial markets  the funds may eventually realize losses  and our revenues  margins  earnings and cash flow would be negatively affected by the reduced revenue when we deliver the underlying products and services 
our ability to execute our growth strategy is highly dependent upon our ability to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates and negotiate transactions on favorable terms 
there has been little acquisition activity by us or the other public companies in the death care industry over the preceding four years  and there is no assurance that we will be able to identify candidates that meet our criteria or that we will be able to reach terms with identified candidates for transactions that are acceptable to us 
we intend to apply standards established under our being the best operating model in qualifying acquisition candidates  and there is no assurance that we will be successful in doing so or that we will find attractive candidates that satisfy these standards 
increased costs may have a negative impact on our earnings and cash flows 
cost increases may impair our ability to achieve revenue growth that exceeds our cost increases 
our plan assumes that we will be successful in increasing revenues at a rate that is greater than the growth in the cost of sales 
we can give no assurance that we will be successful in achieving such increases 
increases in interest rates would increase interest costs on our variable rate indebtedness and could have a material adverse effect on our net income 
as of december   million of our indebtedness was subject to variable interest rates  all under our existing credit facility 
we intend to amend our credit facility  which will also likely be at variable rates  although initially there is no outstanding balance following the repayment of borrowings from the proceeds of the million senior notes offering 
our current senior notes are fixed rate debt instruments  as is the subordinated debt to affiliate debentures 
nevertheless  if we borrow under our proposed amended credit facility  we will become subject to greater exposure to increases in interest rates  and increases in our interest costs could decrease our net income 
covenant restrictions under our debt instruments may limit our flexibility in operating our business 
the terms of our credit facility  including the amendment we intend to obtain  and the indenture governing the senior notes will limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to  among other things incur additional debt  pay dividends or make distributions or redeem or repurchase stock  make investments  grant liens  make capital expenditures  enter into transactions with affiliates  enter into sale leaseback transactions  sell assets  and acquire the assets of  or merge or consolidate with  other companies 
our credit facility also requires us to maintain certain financial ratios 
complying with these restrictive covenants and financial ratios  as well as those that may be contained in any future debt agreements  may impair our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to take advantage of other favorable business opportunities 
they may also limit our ability to pay interest or principal on the notes 
our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants and financial ratios will depend on our future performance  which may be affected by events beyond our control 
our failure to comply with any of these covenants or restrictions when they apply will result in a default under the particular debt instrument  which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and  in some cases  the acceleration of debt under other instruments that contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions 
in the event of an event of default  or in the event of a cross default or cross acceleration  we may not have sufficient funds available to make the required payments under our debt instruments 
if we are unable to repay amounts owed under the terms of our amended senior secured credit facility  the lenders thereunder may be entitled to sell most or substantially all of our assets and the assets of many of our subsidiaries to satisfy our obligations under those agreements 
in such event  we may not be able to fully repay the notes  if at all 
risks related to the death care industry declines in the number of deaths in our markets can cause a decrease in revenues 
changes in the number of deaths are not predictable from market to market or over the short term 
declines in the number of deaths could cause at need sales of funeral and cemetery services  property and merchandise to decline  which could decrease revenues 
although the united states bureau of the census estimates that the number of deaths in the united states will increase through  longer lifespans could reduce the rate of deaths 
in addition  changes in the number of deaths can vary among local markets and from quarter to quarter  and variations in the number of deaths in our markets or from quarter to quarter are not predictable 
these variations may cause our revenues to fluctuate and our results of operations to lack predictability 
the increasing number of cremations in the united states could cause revenues to decline because we could lose market share to firms specializing in cremations 
in addition  direct cremations produce no revenues for cemetery operations and lower funeral revenues 
our traditional cemetery and funeral service operations face competition from the increasing number of cremations in the united states 
industry studies indicate that the percentage of cremations has steadily increased and that cremations will represent approximately of the us burial market by the year  compared to approximately in the trend toward cremation could cause cemeteries and traditional funeral homes to lose market share and revenues to firms specializing in cremations 
in addition  direct cremations with no funeral service  casket  urn  mausoleum niche  columbarium niche or burial produce no revenues for cemetery operations and lower revenues than traditional funerals and  when delivered at a traditional funeral home  produce lower profit margins as well 
if we are not able to respond effectively to changing consumer preferences  our market share  revenues and profitability could decrease 
future market share  revenues and profits will depend in part on our ability to anticipate  identify and respond to changing consumer preferences 
during the last four years  we have implemented new product and service strategies based on results of customer surveys that we conduct on a continuous basis 
however  we may not correctly anticipate or identify trends in consumer preferences  or we may identify them later than our competitors do 
in addition  any strategies we may implement to address these trends may prove incorrect or ineffective 
because the funeral and cemetery businesses are high fixed cost businesses  changes in revenue can have a disproportionately large effect on cash flow and profits 
companies in the funeral home and cemetery business must incur many of the costs of operating and maintaining facilities  land and equipment regardless of the level of sales in any given period 
for example  we must pay salaries  utilities  property taxes and maintenance costs on funeral homes and maintain the grounds of cemeteries regardless of the number of funeral services or interments performed 
because we cannot decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when we experience declines in sales  declines in sales can cause margins  profits and cash flow to decline at a greater rate than the decline in revenues 
changes or increases in  or failure to comply with  regulations applicable to our business could increase costs or decrease cash flows 
the death care industry is subject to extensive regulation and licensing requirements under federal  state and local laws 
for example  the funeral home industry is regulated by the federal trade commission  which requires funeral homes to take actions designed to protect consumers 
state laws impose licensing requirements and regulate preneed sales 
embalming and cremation facilities are subject to stringent environmental and health regulations 
compliance with these regulations is burdensome  and we are always at risk of not complying with the regulations or facing costly and burdensome investigations from regulatory authorities 
in addition  from time to time  governments and agencies propose to amend or add regulations  which could increase costs or decrease cash flows 
for example  federal  state  local and other regulatory agencies have considered and may enact additional legislation or regulations that could affect the death care industry 
several states and regulatory agencies have considered or are considering regulations that could require more liberal refund and cancellation policies for preneed sales of products and services  limit or eliminate our ability to use surety bonding  increase trust requirements and prohibit the common ownership of funeral homes and cemeteries in the same market 
if adopted by the regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate  these and other possible proposals could have a material adverse effect on us  our financial condition  our results of operations and our future prospects

item a 
quantitative and qualitative market risk disclosure carriage is exposed to market risk primarily related to potential increases in interest rates related to the company s debt and changes in the values of securities associated with the preneed and perpetual care trusts 
management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and developing and utilizing appropriate risk management techniques when appropriate and when available for a reasonable price 
we are not exposed to any other significant market risks including commodity price risk  nor foreign currency exchange risk 
carriage monitors current and forecasted interest rate risk incurred in the ordinary course of business and seeks to maintain optimal financial flexibility  quality and solvency 
carriage strives to obtain the optimal cost of capital through a diverse range of funding alternatives and a mix of floating and fixed rate debt 
as of december   approximately of total debt is fixed rate obligations 
given the current outlook for increasing interest rates  we believe the current bias to fixed rate debt is appropriate 
our floating rate long term borrowings consist of the million outstanding under our million floating rate line of credit 
any change in the floating rate will cause a change in interest expense 
for example  each increase in the libor of would increase interest expense by  per year based on the outstanding balance at december  the remainder of carriage s long term debt and leases consist of non interest bearing notes and fixed rate instruments that do not trade in a market  or otherwise have a quoted market value 
any increase in market interest rates causes the fair value of those liabilities to decrease 
the convertible junior subordinated debenture payable to carriage services capital trust pay interest at the fixed rate of and are carried on the company s balance sheet at a cost of approximately million 
we estimate a value of million and million at december  and  respectively  based on available broker quotes of the corresponding preferred securities issued by the trust 
while corresponding preferred securities are very thinly traded  increases in market interest rates may cause the value of these instruments to decrease but such changes will not affect the company s interest costs 
securities subject to market risk consist of investments held by our preneed funeral  cemetery merchandise and services and perpetual care trust funds 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for the estimate of the fair values of those securities
