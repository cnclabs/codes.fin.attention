this md a should be read in conjunction with applied s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
md a consists of the following sections overview a summary of applied s business  measurements and opportunities 
results of operations a discussion of operating results 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources an analysis of cash flows  sources and uses of cash  contractual obligations and financial position 
critical accounting policies a discussion of critical accounting policies that require the exercise of judgments and estimates 
trends  risks and uncertainties a discussion of significant risks that could affect applied s financial condition and or operating results 

table of contents overview applied develops  manufactures  markets and services integrated circuit fabrication equipment for the global semiconductor and semiconductor related industry 
product development and manufacturing activities occur in north america  the united kingdom and israel 
applied s broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and  as a result  are sold through a direct sales force 
customer demand for spare parts and services is fulfilled through a global spare parts distribution system and trained service engineers located around the world in close proximity to customer sites 
as a supplier to this industry  applied s results are primarily driven by worldwide demand for integrated circuits  which in turn depends on end user demand for electronic products 
the industry in which the company operates is volatile 
the downturn that began in fiscal and continued into fiscal constituted what management believes to be the longest and most severe downturn experienced by the industry 
a recovery began in the fourth fiscal quarter of and continued into fiscal the growth peaked in the second half of and slowed thereafter through fiscal applied s results in fiscal through reflect the volatility of the industry 
the following table presents certain significant measurements of the past three fiscal years fiscal year in millions  except per share amounts and percentages new orders net sales gross margin gross margin percent net income loss earnings loss per share during fiscal  lower sales volume and under absorption of manufacturing and service costs resulted in lower gross margins 
in response to the continued difficult economic environment  applied implemented a realignment plan in fiscal  which concluded in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal operating results were negatively affected by lower net sales  reduced gross margins and charges related to realignment activities 
operating results for fiscal reflected a recovery in the semiconductor industry and the global economy  as well as applied s realized savings from the completed realignment activities 
in addition  applied gained market share in critical areas  including mm equipment and copper interconnect  improved operational efficiencies  and further strengthened its cash position 
fiscal results reflected a challenging environment as applied s customers decreased fab utilization globally and reduced or delayed capacity additions as a result of excess inventories and slowing demand for integrated circuits 
during this period  applied focused on lowering costs  improving efficiencies  reducing cycle time and bringing new products to market 
applied also generated strong cash flow  and returned value to stockholders by repurchasing stock and paying cash dividends 
applied s long term opportunities depend in part on successful execution of its growth strategy  including increasing market share in existing markets  expanding into related markets  and cultivating new markets and new business models 
these opportunities are also subject to many factors  including global economic conditions  advanced technology and or capacity requirements of integrated circuit manufacturers and their capital investment trends  the profitability of integrated circuit manufacturers  supply and demand for integrated circuits  applied s investment in rd e  and the relative competitiveness of applied s equipment and service products 
for this and other reasons set forth in the section entitled trends  risks and uncertainties  applied s prior results of operations are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 

table of contents results of operations applied s fiscal year ends on the last sunday in october of each year 
fiscal and each contained weeks  whereas fiscal contained weeks 
the first fiscal quarter of and each contained weeks  whereas the first fiscal quarter of contained weeks 
net sales applied s business was subject to cyclical industry conditions in fiscal  and as a result of these conditions  there were significant fluctuations in applied s quarterly new orders and net sales  both within and across the fiscal years 
demand for integrated circuit manufacturing equipment has historically been volatile as a result of sudden changes in integrated circuit supply and demand and other factors  including rapid technological advances in integrated circuit fabrication processes 
quarterly and full fiscal year financial information was as follows fiscal quarter fiscal first second third fourth year in millions  except per share amounts new orders net sales gross margin net income loss earnings loss per share new orders net sales gross margin net income earnings per share new orders net sales gross margin net income earnings per share 
table of contents net sales by geographic region  which were attributed to the location of the customers facilities  were as follows fiscal year in millions taiwan north america japan korea europe asia pacific primarily the united states 
includes china 
from fiscal through the third quarter of  slowing worldwide demand for integrated circuits resulted in a rapid decline in demand for integrated circuit manufacturing equipment 
inventory buildups in telecommunication products  slower than expected personal computer sales and slower global economic growth caused integrated circuit companies to reduce their capital spending and reschedule or cancel existing orders 
the decline in demand further deepened into a severe industry downturn due to continued weakness in the macro economic climate and reduced consumption of electronic products  which resulted in further capital spending cutbacks by applied s customers 
however  beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of and continuing into fiscal  customers increased their investments in capital equipment for capacity and technology  responding to higher spending for consumer electronics and business information technology and an increase in integrated circuit demand 
the growth peaked in the second half of and slowed thereafter into fiscal as a result of excess inventories and slowing demand for integrated circuits  customers reduced production and delayed capacity additions in fiscal new orders in the first half of declined to billion per quarter  reflecting the continued and prolonged downturn in the integrated circuit industry 
however  new orders increased during the second half of  reflecting customers continued investments in advanced memory and logic and transition to mm  along with the increased capacity utilization in both advanced and established technologies 
following these new order trends  net sales decreased to approximately billion for each of the first three fiscal quarters of  reflecting the impact of the industry downturn 
net sales increased to billion for the fourth fiscal quarter of  indicating the beginning of an industry recovery 
net sales for fiscal were billion 
new orders increased from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal  reflecting a broad based increase in capital investment by both advanced memory and logic manufacturers for mm technology to meet rising demand for integrated circuits 
following the new order trends  net sales increased percent from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal  reflecting the fulfillment of higher levels of orders for capital equipment received in prior quarters to support customers manufacturing capacity expansion and new technology requirements 
new orders decreased percent from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal  as integrated circuit manufacturers reduced their capital investments to bring inventories in line with demand 
following the trend of decreasing orders during fiscal  net sales decreased by percent from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal  reflecting lower demand for integrated circuit products 
realignment activities during fiscal  in response to the continuing difficult business conditions  applied implemented a series of activities to better align applied s cost structure with prevailing economic conditions 
realignment activities consisted of consolidation of facilities  reductions in workforce  and refocused product efforts 
as a result of the 
table of contents realignment activities  applied vacated approximately two million square feet and reduced approximately  positions during fiscal realignment activities resulted in charges across multiple categories  as incurred  including cost of products sold  rd e expenses  and restructuring and asset impairment charges 
during the first fiscal quarter of  realignment activities were completed and reported as restructuring  asset impairments and other charges  as discussed below 
there were no realignment charges during fiscal gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased from percent for fiscal to percent for fiscal  and decreased to percent for fiscal in fiscal  applied experienced unprecedented new order and revenue growth 
accordingly  applied expanded its manufacturing facilities to accommodate anticipated growth 
the lower business volume in fiscal through fiscal  due to the industry downturn  was insufficient to fully absorb the overhead costs of these facilities  resulting in lower gross margins for all respective periods 
the continued decline in gross margin for fiscal was principally attributable to under absorption of manufacturing and field service costs as a result of prolonged low business volumes  and inventory writeoffs and charges associated with refocused product efforts 
the increase in gross margin from fiscal to fiscal was principally attributable to improved revenue levels  changes in product mix  decreased product costs  and increased manufacturing volume  resulting in higher absorption of manufacturing and field service costs and the completion of refocused product efforts discussed previously 
the improvement in gross margin was partially offset by increased variable compensation costs as a result of improved operating performance 
the decrease in gross margin from fiscal to fiscal was due to lower revenue levels  lower manufacturing absorption and changes in product mix  which were partially offset by initiatives for cost reduction and efficiency improvement  such as common platform architecture and parts  lower cost sourcing and cycle time reduction 
research  development and engineering applied s future operating results depend  to a considerable extent  on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the products and services it provides 
applied believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rd e to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers most advanced integrated circuit designs 
applied has historically maintained its commitment to investing in rd e in order to continue to offer new products and technologies 
as a result  rd e expenses were million percent of net sales for fiscal  million percent of net sales for fiscal and million percent of net sales for fiscal development cycles range from to months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product or a new product 
most of applied s existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies  materials and processes 
in certain instances  applied acquires technologies either in its existing areas of development or through new product opportunities to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market 
in fiscal  applied refocused its product efforts and made investments in strategic products 
applied concentrated on the development of several important processing technologies to enable the production of chips using copper and low k dielectric materials  as well as to meet the challenges of smaller feature sizes  such as nm and below 
in addition to interconnect solutions  applied continued to invest resources in the development of systems for advanced transistor designs with smaller gate structures that enable faster signal propagation and reduced power 
applied also continued the development of its process diagnostic and control capabilities with systems to inspect and measure smaller dimensions and defects 
in fiscal  applied continued its investment in developing technologies for future generation manufacturing 
advances were made in several key areas  including technology for enhancing transistor and interconnect performance 
applied introduced ten major products in these areas  including the endura  ecmp  quantum x and g fib systems  all targeted for nm and below chip manufacturing 
in addition  applied introduced the gen akt flat panel system 
in fiscal  applied focused on developing systems for customers advanced chip designs  including systems to enable smaller and faster interconnect and transistor structures with nm  nm and below geometries 

table of contents for copper interconnect applications  the company introduced the applied endura cub s system with advanced copper barrier seed technology and the applied producer black diamond ii system for next generation low k dielectric layers 
for leading edge transistor gate applications  applied launched the applied advantedge etch system and the applied vantage radox rtp 
new applications in strain engineering  which involves creating localized areas of stress in the transistor structure  were also developed for existing systems to meet customers requirements for faster transistors 
in the area of inspection and metrology  applied launched uvision  the industry s first laser d brightfield inspection tool 
the applied opc check software is designed to automate critical opc mask verification for customers 
applied s akt subsidiary developed the gen akt k pecvd system for manufacturing flat panel displays 
the system processes m x m glass substrates and doubles the capacity of previous gen systems for producing inch lcd tv screens 
marketing  selling  general and administrative marketing  selling  general and administrative expenses were million percent of net sales for fiscal  increased to million percent of net sales for fiscal  and decreased to million percent of net sales for fiscal the increase from fiscal to correlated to the increase in business volume  as well as increases in variable compensation as a result of improved operating performance 
the decrease from fiscal to was due to lower business volume  reductions in variable compensation and applied s continued focus on cost controls 
restructuring  asset impairments and other charges the restructuring actions taken in fiscal and were intended to better align applied s cost structure with prevailing market conditions due to the industry downturn at the time 
these actions  which were necessary as a result of reduced business volume  reduced applied s global workforce and consolidated global facilities 
restructuring  asset impairments and other charges for fiscal totaled million  consisting of million for headcount reductions  million for consolidation of facilities and million for other costs  primarily fixed asset writeoffs due to facility consolidations 
restructuring  asset impairments and other charges for fiscal totaled million  consisting of million for facility consolidations  million for severance and benefits  and million for other costs  primarily fixed asset writeoffs due to facility consolidations 
as of october   the fiscal and restructuring actions have been completed  and restructuring reserve balances consist principally of remaining lease commitments associated with facilities 
for further details  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
litigation settlements  net litigation settlements  net were million for fiscal and consisted of costs of million related to two separate patent litigation settlements  net of a gain of million related to a legal settlement in favor of applied 
during fiscal or  there were no significant litigation settlements 
net interest income net interest income was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal the decrease in net interest income from fiscal to was due primarily to lower average portfolio yields 
the increase in net interest income in was due to a substantial increase in interest rates and a decrease in interest expense associated with scheduled debt maturities in september and september income taxes applied s effective income tax provision benefit rate was percent for fiscal  percent for fiscal and percent for fiscal applied s effective tax rate of percent for fiscal differed from percent for fiscal due to increased export tax benefits and foreign tax credits 
applied s effective rate of 
table of contents percent for fiscal differed from percent for fiscal primarily due to the favorable resolution of a multi year internal revenue service irs tax examination of million and a change in estimate with respect to export tax benefits of million  partially offset by a charge of million relating to the distribution of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of the jobs creation act 
applied s future effective income tax rate depends on various factors  such as tax legislation  the geographic composition of applied s pre tax income and non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions 
management carefully monitors these factors and timely adjusts the effective income tax rate accordingly 
in october  the united states congress enacted the jobs creation act which provides for a three year phase out of current extraterritorial income tax eti benefits and replaces eti with a phased in nine percent domestic production activity deduction that will not be fully effective until the jobs creation act will not fully replace applied s current eti tax benefits 
business combinations on june   applied purchased certain assets of scp global technology  inc scp  consisting of single wafer hf last immersion technology and marangoni clean dry intellectual property  for approximately million in cash

fsp eitf delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs of eitf issue in november  the fasb issued fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain other than temporary investments 
this fsp addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss 
this statement specifically nullifies the requirements of paragraph of eitf and references existing other than temporary impairment guidance 
the guidance under this fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  applied continued to apply relevant other than temporary guidance as provided for in fsp eitf during fiscal applied does not expect the implementation of fsp fas and fas will have a material effect on applied s financial position or results of operations 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources applied s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased from billion at october  to billion at october  due primarily to repurchases and cash dividend distributions 
applied has not undertaken any significant external financing activities for several years 
applied generated cash from operating activities of million for fiscal  billion for fiscal and billion for fiscal the primary sources of cash from operating activities have been net income  as adjusted to exclude the effect of non cash charges  and changes in working capital levels  including accounts receivable and inventories 
applied utilized programs to sell accounts receivable of million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal the sales of these accounts receivable increased cash and reduced accounts receivable and days sales outstanding 
days sales outstanding were days at the end of fiscal  compared to days at the end of fiscal and days at the end of fiscal a portion of these sold accounts receivable is subject to certain limited recourse provisions 
however  applied has not experienced any losses under these programs availability and usage of these accounts receivable sale agreements depend on many factors  including the willingness of financial institutions to purchase receivables and the cost of such arrangements 
the increase in days sales outstanding in fiscal is primarily related to the change in the regional sales mix and the resulting relative decrease in the amount of sold accounts receivable 
for further details regarding accounts receivable sales  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
inventories decreased by million in fiscal  which corresponds to the decrease in business volume and sales activity from fiscal to fiscal applied used billion of cash for investing activities for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal capital expenditures were million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal  totaling million for the past three years 
application laboratories  equipment and related facilities have comprised the majority of the capital spending 
fiscal capital expenditures also 
table of contents included million for the purchase of facilities in hillsboro  oregon that were previously held under a synthetic lease 
fiscal capital expenditures consisted principally of laboratory and demonstration equipment 
fiscal capital expenditures included investment in laboratory equipment and upgrades to applied s enterprise resource planning software and network architecture 
investing activities also included purchases and sales of short term investments and acquisitions of technology or companies to allow applied to access new market opportunities or emerging technologies 
during fiscal  applied paid million  net of cash acquired  for the metron and ecosys acquisitions  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
applied generated cash of million from financing activities for fiscal  used cash of million for fiscal and used cash for billion for financing activities included issuances and repurchases of common stock and payment of dividends 
since march  applied has systematically repurchased shares of its common stock in the open market to partially fund its stock based employee benefit and incentive plans 
cash used to repurchase shares totaled million for fiscal  million for fiscal and billion for fiscal beginning in the second fiscal quarter of  applied s board of directors declared three consecutive quarterly cash dividends  in the amount of per share per declaration 
the first two declared cash dividends totaling million were paid during fiscal the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on the company s financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements  business conditions and other factors 
financing activities also included borrowings and repayments of debt 
applied did not borrow any cash in fiscal years  or cash used for debt repayments totaled million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal cash generated from issuances of common stock pursuant to applied s equity compensation programs totaled million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above  applied s management believes that cash generated from operations  together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability  will be sufficient to satisfy applied s liquidity requirements for the next months 
for further details regarding applied s operating  investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended october   see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report 
off balance sheet arrangements during the ordinary course of business  applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either applied or its subsidiaries 
as of october   the maximum potential amount of future payments that applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately million 
applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed 
applied does not believe  based on historical experience and information currently available  that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee arrangements 
in  applied formed applied materials ventures i  lp the fund to invest in privately held  early stage companies engaged in developing systems  components and devices based on nanotechnology and or communications technology for specific applications and products 
the fund was a limited partnership  with applied as the sole limited partner and an independent party as the general partner 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  applied exercised its right to limit capital contributions to the fund to million and to elect to terminate the partnership 
as a result  under the provisions of the partnership agreement  the activities of the partnership concluded and the partnership was dissolved in march applied s cumulative capital contributions to the fund totaled approximately million through october  and million through october  the fund s assets  which primarily consisted of shares of portfolio companies  were distributed between applied and the general partner during fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on the fund 
applied also has operating leases for various facilities 
total rental expense for operating leases was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal 
table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes applied s contractual obligations as of october  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in millions long term debt obligations interest expense associated with long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities represents applied s agreements to purchase goods and services consisting of applied s a outstanding purchase orders for goods and services  b contractual requirements to make specified minimum payments even if applied does not take delivery of the contracted goods  and c contractual requirements to pay a penalty if the contract is cancelled 
while the amount above represents applied s purchase agreements as of october   the actual amounts to be paid by applied may be less in the event that any agreements are renegotiated  cancelled or terminated 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied s consolidated financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied s financial condition or results of operations 
specifically  these policies have the following attributes applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates applied could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on applied s financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as applied s operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
in addition  management is periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
these uncertainties are discussed in the section below entitled trends  risks and uncertainties 
based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that applied s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and provide a meaningful presentation of applied s financial condition and results of operations 
management believes that the following are critical accounting policies warranty costs applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized 
estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs 

table of contents applied s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates  material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period 
as applied s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally  labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs 
the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs 
unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs 
if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
inventory valuation inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand 
applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory might be required  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  and also reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives annually for impairment 
intangible assets  such as purchased technology  are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition 
the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates  applied may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value 
the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using the market multiples approach  and is dependent on market values for companies in a similar industry 
a severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
management has determined that it is more likely than not that its future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets 
the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings  tax regulations governing each region  non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits 
management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate on a timely basis 
if actual results differ from these estimates  applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied s expectations could have a material impact on applied s results of operations and financial condition 
legal matters applied is subject to various legal proceedings and claims  either asserted or unasserted  that arise in the ordinary course of business 
applied evaluates  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable 
table of contents outcome and reasonably estimates the amount of the loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of the probability and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
when applied determines that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable  the effect is recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
although the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty  applied does not believe that any of the existing legal matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
however  significant changes in legal proceedings and claims or the factors considered in the evaluation of those matters could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
trends  risks and uncertainties the industry that applied serves is volatile and unpredictable 
as a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductor related industry  applied is subject to the industry s business cycles  the timing  length and volatility of which are difficult to predict 
the industry has historically been cyclical due to sudden changes in demand for integrated circuits and manufacturing capacity  including capacity using the latest technology 
the effect on applied of these changes in demand  including end customer demand  is occurring more rapidly  exacerbating the volatility of these cycles 
these changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers capital equipment purchases and investments in technology  and continue to affect applied s orders  net sales  gross margin and results of operations 
applied must effectively manage its resources and production capacity to meet changing demand 
during periods of decreasing demand for integrated circuit manufacturing equipment  applied must be able to appropriately align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions  effectively motivate and retain key employees  and effectively manage its supply chain 
during periods of increasing demand  applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand and must be able to attract  retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified individuals and effectively manage its supply chain 
if applied is not able to timely and appropriately align its cost structure with business conditions and or to effectively manage its resources and production capacity  including its supply chain during changes in demand  applied s business  financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the industry 
the industry is characterized by ongoing changes  including changes in customers capacity requirements  capacity utilization and capital spending  which depend in part on the demand for customers products and customers inventory levels relative to demand  the importance of reducing the cost of system ownership  due in part to the increasing significance of consumer electronics as a driver for integrated circuit demand and the related focus on lower prices  varying levels of business information technology spending  increasingly complex technology requirements  including a significant rise in the number and importance of new materials  the growing types and varieties of integrated circuits and applications  an expanding number of applications across multiple substrate sizes  resulting in divergent demands among integrated circuit manufacturers  customers varying adoption rates of new technology  a rising percentage of business from customers in asia and the emergence of customers  competitors and suppliers in new geographical regions  customer demands for shorter lead times for the manufacture and installation of integrated circuit manufacturing equipment  the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity  the effect on system demand as a result of the increasing productivity and reliability of integrated circuit manufacturing equipment  the increasing pace of changes in the mix of investments by customers in integrated circuit manufacturing equipment  customers increasing use of partnerships  alliances  joint ventures and industry consortia that has increased the influence of key integrated circuit manufacturers in technology decisions made by their global partners  higher capital requirements for new integrated circuit fabrication plants  the rising importance of speed of product development and time to market  the increasing difficulty for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing  the challenge to customers of moving volume manufacturing from one technology node to the next smaller technology node  the rate of growth in the industry  a heightening concern among certain us governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial and or security issues posed by the growing manufacturing business in asia  especially china  the need to effectively manage a growing number of 
table of contents existing and new products in more varied competitive environments  and the increasing importance of operating flexibility to enable different responses to different markets  customers and applications 
these changes  individually or in combination  are increasing the need for customer partnering  use of foundries  collaborative research and development efforts  and process integration support 
certain of these changes also heighten the importance of spare parts and service product offerings as a competitive advantage for integrated circuit equipment manufacturers  even though service products typically result in lower gross margins than system products 
in response to these ongoing changes  applied must regularly reassess the size  capability and location of its global infrastructure 
if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the industry  its business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
applied operates in a highly competitive industry characterized by increasingly rapid technological changes 
as applied operates in a highly competitive environment  applied s future success heavily depends on effective development  commercialization and customer acceptance of its new equipment  service and related products 
in addition  applied must successfully execute its growth strategy  including increasing market share in existing markets  expanding into related markets  and cultivating new markets and new business models  while constantly improving its operational performance 
applied s success is subject to many risks  including  but not limited to  its ability to timely and cost effectively develop and market new products and price products appropriately  improve existing products and increase market share in its existing markets  expand into or develop related and new markets for its technology  achieve market acceptance of  and accurately forecast demand and meet production schedules for  its products  achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings  adapt to technology changes in related markets  such as lithography  adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain  qualify products for volume manufacturing with its customers  and successfully implement improvements in its manufacturing process 
the development  introduction and support of an increasingly broad set of products  including those enabling the transition to smaller device feature sizes and incorporation of new materials  have grown increasingly complex and expensive over time 
furthermore  new or improved products may involve higher costs and reduced efficiencies compared to applied s more established products and could adversely affect applied s gross margins 
in addition  applied must successfully implement changes in its design engineering methodology  including changes that result in significant decreases in material costs and cycle time  greater commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems  and effective product life cycle management 
if applied does not successfully manage these challenges  its business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business 
in fiscal  approximately percent of applied s net sales were to regions outside the united states 
certain manufacturing facilities and suppliers of applied are also located outside the united states 
managing applied s global operations presents challenges including  but not limited to  those arising from varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands  global trade issues  variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights in different countries  rising raw material and energy costs  variations in the ability to develop relationships with suppliers and other local businesses  changes in laws and regulations of the united states including export restrictions and other countries  as well as their interpretation and application  fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates  the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations  political instability  natural disasters such as earthquakes  hurricanes or floods  pandemics  terrorism or acts of war where applied has operations  suppliers or sales  cultural differences  special government supported efforts to promote local integrated circuit manufacturing equipment companies  and shipping delays 
many of these challenges are present in china  a large potential market for integrated circuit equipment and an area that applied anticipates will continue to present a significant opportunity for growth over the long term 
china is also experiencing significant growth of suppliers and potential competitors to applied 
these challenges  as well as global uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries  consumer confidence  the sustainability  timing  rate and amount of demand for electronics products and integrated circuits  capital spending by integrated circuit manufacturers  
table of contents and price trends for certain integrated circuit devices  may materially and adversely affect applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 
applied s customer base is and has been highly concentrated 
orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers of integrated circuits have accounted for  and likely will continue to account for  a substantial portion of applied s net sales 
in addition  the mix and type of customers  and sales to any single customer  may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
if customers do not place orders  or delay or cancel orders  applied may not be able to replace the business 
as applied s products are configured to customer specifications  changing  rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant non recoverable costs 
major customers may also seek and on occasion receive pricing  payment terms or other conditions that are less favorable to applied 
in addition  certain customers have formed strategic alliances or collaborative efforts that result in additional complexities in managing individual customer relationships and transactions 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the ability to attract  retain and motivate key employees is vital to applied s success 
applied s success and competitiveness depend in large part on its ability to attract  retain and motivate key employees 
achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors  including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions  changes in applied s management or leadership  the effectiveness of applied s compensation programs  including its equity based programs  and competitors hiring practices 
applied has made adjustments to its equity compensation programs  such as implementation of a broad based program providing for grants of restricted stock units referred to as performance shares in the applied materials  inc employee stock incentive plan beginning in fiscal these changes  as well as other changes in compensation practices or employee benefit programs  may reduce the effectiveness of the equity compensation programs as incentives to employees and or may be disruptive to operations 
beginning in its first fiscal quarter of  applied will record a charge to earnings for equity based compensation  such as stock options and restricted stock units performance shares  in accordance with sfas r 
this requirement reduces the attractiveness of granting equity based compensation as the expense associated with these grants will decrease applied s profitability 
if applied does not successfully attract  retain and motivate key employees as a result of these or other factors  applied s operating results and ability to capitalize on its opportunities may be materially and adversely affected 
manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect applied s ability to meet customer demand  while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory 
applied s business depends on its ability to supply equipment  services and related products that meet the rapidly changing requirements of its customers  which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts  components and subassemblies collectively  parts from suppliers 
some key parts may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers  and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers in developing regions  including china 
additionally  applied plans to transition to a single vendor enterprise resource planning erp software system to perform various functions  including order management and manufacturing control 
significant interruptions of manufacturing operations or the delivery of services as a result of the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver quality parts  volatility in the availability and cost of materials  difficulties or delays in obtaining required export approvals  information technology or infrastructure failures  difficulties in implementing the erp system  natural disasters such as earthquakes  hurricanes or floods  or other causes such as regional economic downturns  epidemics  political instability  terrorism or acts of war  could result in delayed deliveries  manufacturing inefficiencies  increased costs or order cancellations 
moreover  if actual demand for applied s products is different than expected  applied may purchase more fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling  postponing or expediting delivery of parts 
any or all of these factors could materially and adversely affect applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the failure to successfully implement outsourcing activities could adversely affect results of operations 
to better align costs with market conditions and to increase productivity and operational efficiency  applied outsources certain functions to third parties  including companies in india  china and other countries 
these functions include engineering  manufacturing  customer support  software development and administrative activities 
the expanding role of third party providers has required changes to applied s existing operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for retaining and managing these providers in order to protect its intellectual property 
if applied does not effectively develop and implement its outsourcing strategy  if required export approvals are not timely obtained  or if third party providers do not perform as anticipated  applied may not realize productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties  increased costs  manufacturing interruptions or delays and or loss of its intellectual property rights  which could materially and adversely affect applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
applied is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions 
applied has made  and may in the future make  acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses with complementary or aligned products  services and or technologies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including but not limited to diversion of management s attention from other operational matters  inability to complete acquisitions as anticipated or at all  inability to realize synergies expected to result from an acquisition  failure to commercialize purchased technologies  ineffectiveness of an acquired company s internal controls  impairment of acquired intangible assets as a result of technological advancements or worse than expected performance of the acquired company or its product offerings  unknown  underestimated and or undisclosed commitments or liabilities  failure to integrate and retain key employees  and ineffective integration of operations 
mergers and acquisitions are inherently subject to significant risks  and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims and protection of intellectual property rights 
applied from time to time is  and in the future may be  involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement  intellectual property rights  antitrust  environmental regulations  securities  contracts  product performance  product liability  unfair competition  employment and other matters 
in addition  applied on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that applied owes them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against customers by third parties 
these legal proceedings and claims  whether with or without merit  may be time consuming and expensive to prosecute or defend and divert management s attention and resources 
there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims 
applied previously entered into a mutual covenant not to sue arrangement with one of its competitors to decrease the risk of patent infringement lawsuits in the future 
there can be no assurance that the intended results of this arrangement will be achieved or that applied will be able to adequately protect its intellectual property rights with the restrictions associated with such a covenant 
in addition  applied s success depends in part on the protection of its intellectual property and other rights 
infringement of applied s rights by a third party  such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts  could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for applied 
applied s intellectual property rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented  invalidated  rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change  or if applied does not adequately assert these rights 
furthermore  the laws of other countries  including china  permit the protection and enforcement of applied s rights to varying extents  which may not be sufficient to protect applied s rights 
if applied is not able to resolve a claim  negotiate a settlement of the matter  obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms  and or successfully prosecute or defend its position  applied s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
changes in tax rates or tax liabilities could affect future results 
as a global company  applied is subject to taxation in the united states and various other countries 
significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities 
applied s future tax rates 
table of contents could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates  changes in the valuation of applied s deferred tax assets and liabilities  or changes in the tax laws 
for example  us legislation governing taxation of extraterritorial income eti repealed certain export subsidies that were prohibited by the world trade organization and enacted different tax provisions 
these tax provisions will not fully offset the loss of the repealed tax provisions and  as a result  applied s us tax liability may increase 
in addition  applied is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes 
although applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable  there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in applied s historical income tax provisions and accruals  which could materially and adversely affect applied s results of operations 
applied is subject to internal control evaluations and attestation requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  applied s management must perform evaluations of applied s internal control over financial reporting 
beginning as of the end of fiscal and annually thereafter  applied s form k must include a report of its management s assessment of the adequacy of such internal control  and applied s independent registered public accounting firm must publicly attest to the adequacy of management s assessment and the effectiveness of applied s internal control 
ongoing compliance with these requirements is complex  costly and time consuming 
if applied fails to maintain an effective internal control over financial reporting  if applied s management does not timely assess the adequacy of such internal control  or if applied s independent registered public accounting firm does not timely attest to the evaluation  applied could be subject to regulatory sanctions and the public s perception of applied may decline 
applied is exposed to risks associated with expanded service product offerings and strategic transactions 
in order to improve customers manufacturing productivity and efficiency and as part of its growth strategy  applied is expanding its service product offerings for both applied and non applied products 
these new service products  which include on site support as well as supply chain and spare parts management  are offered in part through strategic relationships and alliances formed with  or acquisitions of  other suppliers to the semiconductor industry 
in order to develop this market opportunity  applied must cultivate new business models  form and maintain strategic relationships with appropriate companies  achieve customer acceptance  and successfully and cost effectively provide these service products 
applied s inability to achieve any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
applied is subject to risks of non compliance with environmental and safety regulations 
applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations  including  but not limited to  regulations related to the development  manufacture and use of its products  the operation of its facilities  and the use of its real property 
failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations could result in significant remediation liabilities  the imposition of fines and or the suspension or termination of development  manufacture or use of certain of its products  or may affect the operation of its facilities or use of its real property  each of which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
applied is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory environment 
applied is subject to various risks related to new  different  inconsistent or even conflicting laws  rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies and or regulatory agencies in the countries in which applied operates and with which applied must comply  disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade  and the interpretation and application of laws  rules and regulations 
if applied is found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with applicable laws  rules or regulations  applied s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at october   applied s investment portfolio included fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately billion 
applied s primary objective for investing in fixed income securities is to preserve principal while maximizing returns and minimizing risk 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
based on applied s investment portfolio at october  and october   an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately million and million  respectively 
while an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio  applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated statement of operations unless the individual fixed income securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
applied s long term debt bears interest at fixed rates 
as such  applied s interest expense would increase only to the extent that applied significantly increased the amount of variable rate obligations outstanding 
due to the short term nature and relatively low amount of applied s variable rate obligations  an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on applied s near term financial condition or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk certain operations of applied are conducted in foreign currencies  such as japanese yen  british pound  euro and israeli shekel 
applied enters into forward exchange and currency option contracts to hedge a portion of  but not all  existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within months 
gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the consolidated statements of operations at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized 
because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward exchange and currency option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged  these financial instruments are not expected to subject applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
net foreign currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on applied s results of operations for fiscal  or forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the underlying transactions primarily japanese yen  british pound  euro and israeli shekel  and the terms of the forward exchange contracts generally match the terms of the underlying transactions 
applied s outstanding forward exchange contracts are marked to market see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  as are the majority of the related underlying transactions being hedged  therefore  the effect of exchange rate changes on forward exchange contracts is expected to be substantially offset by the effect of these changes on the underlying transactions 
the effect of an immediate percent change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged transactions is not expected to be material to applied s near term financial condition or results of operations 
applied s risk with respect to currency option contracts is limited to the premium paid for the right to exercise the option 
premiums paid for options outstanding at october  were not material
