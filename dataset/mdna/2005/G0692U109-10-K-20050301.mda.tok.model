item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we underwrite insurance and reinsurance on a global basis 
our business currently consists of four segments global insurance  global reinsurance  us insurance and us reinsurance 
following a strategic reorganization of our operations  with effect from january  we will revise our segmental disclosures to better reflect our internal management reporting structure 
we will classify our operations into two underwriting segments  insurance and reinsurance  and a corporate segment 
our insurance operations will be further sub divided into two sub segments  us insurance and global insurance 
we believe that our revised segments represent operations that have homogenous features in terms of products  markets  distribution channels  client types  underlying risk patterns and approach to risk management 
on july   we completed an initial public offering of million newly issued common shares and million common shares offered by selling shareholders 
net proceeds to the company from the offering were million and were credited to shareholders equity 
in april  we completed a secondary offering of million common shares offered by selling shareholders 
we did not sell any common shares in connection with this offering and did not receive any proceeds 
on december   we announced that our board had authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common shares 
on february   we repurchased  common shares owned by initial investors at our formation pursuant to the repurchase program 
the average purchase price was per common share and the aggregate purchase price was million  which exhausted the repurchase program 
the markets in which we operate have historically been cyclical 
during periods of excess underwriting capacity  as defined by availability of capital  competition can result in lower pricing and less favorable policy terms and conditions for insurers and reinsurers 
during periods of reduced underwriting capacity  pricing and policy terms and conditions are generally more favorable for insurers and reinsurers 
historically  underwriting capacity has been impacted by several factors  including industry losses  catastrophes  changes in legal and regulatory guidelines  investment results and the ratings and financial strength of competitors 
we believe that we are currently operating in a marketplace that generally continues to offer favorable pricing and or terms and conditions in all of our business segments  however  there are lines of business that are experiencing less favorable pricing  terms and conditions than in the prior year 
for our global insurance segment  current pricing  terms and conditions are generally at or above the level required to produce target returns 
as expected  the impact of the losses generated by the hurricanes in august and september is having a positive impact on pricing in our offshore energy business  particularly for loss affected contracts 
we believe that pricing pressure on us large property accounts and onshore energy business still persists 
for our us insurance business  we expect pricing to stabilize in a number of areas in most notably  we have begun to experience lessening in price decreases in our professional lines business in the last quarter of and expect this trend to continue into we anticipate that rate decreases will continue with respect to our us property business 
january is traditionally a major renewal period for our reinsurance segments 
the unprecedented claims burden from natural catastrophes in has heightened risk awareness and appreciation for protection against losses from natural perils  particularly in the us while property reinsurance premiums are declining  we believe loss affected accounts in the us are receiving increases commensurate with the severity of the loss experience of the program 
the casualty reinsurance line of business has proven more resistant to rating pressures 
we have seen many primary companies substantially increasing their retentions and ceding less business in response to the relatively tight reinsurance terms 
we believe that this factor may impact the market opportunity for our casualty reinsurance lines 
we derive our revenues primarily from the sale of our insurance policies and reinsurance contracts 
insurance and reinsurance premiums are a function of the number and type of contracts we write  as well as prevailing market prices 
renewal dates for our business segments depend upon the underlying line of business 
for the majority of business in our global insurance and us insurance segments  gross premiums are written throughout the year 
an exception to this is the business written in our aviation and aviation war accounts  which is predominantly written in the last quarter of the calendar year 
for our global reinsurance segment  a significant portion of our gross premiums is written in the first quarter of the calendar year  with the remainder primarily split between the second and third quarters 
for the majority of business written in our us reinsurance segment  gross premiums are written primarily in the first and third quarters of the calendar year 
our premium income is supplemented by the income we generate from our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed income investments that are held as available for sale 
under us gaap  these investments are carried at fair market value and unrealized gains and losses on the investments are not included in our statement of operations 
rather  these unrealized gains and losses are included on our balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive gain loss as a separate component of shareholders equity 
our investment strategy seeks to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while trying to maximize investment return through a high quality  diversified portfolio 
the volatility of claims and the interest rate environment can affect the returns we generate on our investment portfolio 
our expenses primarily consist of net losses and loss expenses  acquisition costs  general and administrative expenses and interest expense 
net losses and loss expenses are management s best estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred during a reporting period 
many of our lines of business have loss experience characterized as low frequency and high severity  which may cause volatility in our results of operations from period to period 
also  we have substantial exposure to unexpected losses resulting from natural disasters  man made catastrophes and other catastrophic events 
the incidence and occurrence of such catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and our losses from catastrophes could be substantial 
although we attempt to manage our exposure to such events across the organization in a variety of ways  including transfer of risk to other reinsurers  a single catastrophic event could affect multiple business segments and the frequency or severity of a catastrophic event could exceed our estimates 
acquisition costs relate to the fees  commissions and taxes paid to obtain business 
we offset commissions received on ceded premiums against acquisition costs 
typically  acquisition costs are based on a percentage of the premium written and will vary by each line of business that we underwrite 
our commissions include amounts accrued under incentive commission arrangements 
these type of arrangements are under scrutiny following an industry wide investigation by the attorney general of the state of new york 
we have accrued our best estimate of the amount due under these arrangements  however  given the uncertainties that exist surrounding the calculation and payment of these incentive commissions  this estimate is subject to change 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and general operating expenses 
with effect from january   we included the personnel expenses of our underwriters in general and administrative expenses  prior to that date  they were included in acquisition costs 
disclosures relating to prior periods have been restated to reflect this change 
in addition  with effect from january   we allocated all of our general and administrative costs  except for corporate expenses  to our underwriting segments 
our corporate costs include holding company costs necessary to support our worldwide insurance and reinsurance operations and costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
prior periods have not been restated to reflect the full allocation of general and administrative costs as our business segments were not fully operational throughout and we do not allocate our assets by segment as we evaluate the underwriting results of each segment separately from the results of our investment portfolio 
interest expense consists of interest due on outstanding debt  the amortization of debt offering expenses and offering discounts and fees paid in respect of our credit facility 
prior to december   fees paid in respect of our credit facility were included in general and administrative expenses 
consequently disclosures relating to prior periods have been restated to reflect this change 
our ultimate objective as an insurance and reinsurance company is to generate superior returns on capital that appropriately reward us for the risks we assume and to grow revenue only when we deem the returns meet or exceed our requirements 
to achieve this objective  we must be able to accurately assess the potential losses associated with the risks that we insure and reinsure  to manage our investment portfolio risk appropriately and to control acquisition costs and infrastructure throughout the organization 
three financial measures that are meaningful in analyzing our performance are return on equity  combined ratio and underwriting income 
our return on equity calculation is based on the level of net income generated from the average of the opening and closing shareholders equity during the period 
the combined ratio is a formula used by insurance and reinsurance companies to relate net premiums earned during a period to net losses and loss expenses  acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses during a period 
a combined ratio above indicates that a company is incurring more in net losses and loss expenses  acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses than it is earning in net premiums 
we consider the combined ratio an appropriate indicator of our underwriting performance  particularly given the short tail orientation of our overall portfolio of risks 
underwriting income is a measure of profitability that takes into account net premiums earned and other insurance related income as revenue and net losses and loss expenses  acquisition costs and underwriting related general and administrative expenses as expenses 
underwriting income is the difference between these revenue and expense items 
the following table details our key performance indicators year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  in thousands  except share and per share amounts gross premiums written    net premiums earned    underwriting income    net income    net loss and loss expense ratio acquisition cost ratio general and administrative expense ratio combined ratio return on average equity because we have a limited operating history and are exposed to volatility in our results of operations  period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful 
in addition  the amount of premiums written with respect to any particular segment or line of business may vary from year to year as a result of changes in market conditions 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes presented under item included in this report 
acquisition history on october   we completed the purchase of the connecticut specialty insurance company for million and subsequently renamed it axis specialty insurance company 
axis insurance is licensed in connecticut and eligible to write surplus lines insurance in states and the district of columbia 
on november   we completed the purchase of royal sunalliance personal insurance company  which is licensed in all states of the united states  the district of columbia and puerto rico and was subsequently renamed axis reinsurance company 
we paid a purchase price of million 
at the dates that axis insurance and axis reinsurance were acquired  the pre acquisition liabilities had been assumed by the sellers or their affiliates 
the respective sellers further agreed to indemnify the acquired companies and our us holding company from and against any and all such liabilities 
some of the underlying liabilities have been reinsured with third parties 
other liabilities are being collateralized by a pledge of securities 
in the event that the reinsurance and collateralization are insufficient to pay all covered insurance claims  and the sellers do not fulfill their obligations under the indemnity  we would have liability for such claims 
on february   we completed the acquisition of sheffield insurance corporation for million and subsequently renamed it axis surplus insurance company 
at the time of purchase  sheffield insurance corporation was licensed to write insurance in illinois and alabama and eligible to write surplus lines insurance in states and the district of columbia 
in addition  we added a team of insurance professionals from combined specialty group  inc in the first half of  we acquired the renewal rights to a book of directors and officers liability insurance and related lines business written by the financial insurance solutions fis group of kemper in exchange for an agreement to make an override payment 
the override payment is based on a percentage of gross written premiums of all fis accounts that are renewed by the company 
we purchased this company and agreed to acquire these rights as the foundation for commencing our us insurance operations 
critical accounting policies there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical due to the amount of judgment and uncertainty inherent in the application of those policies 
in calculating financial statement estimates  the use of different assumptions could produce materially different estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect significant estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
reserve for losses and loss expenses 
for most insurance and reinsurance companies  the most significant judgment made by management is the estimation of the reserve for losses and loss expenses  which we also refer to as loss reserves 
our loss reserves are estimated every quarter by ernst young  who acts as our independent reserving actuary  and are based on generally accepted actuarial principles 
these reserves are then discussed with and reviewed by management prior to management establishing the ultimate loss reserves 
the reserve for unpaid reported losses and loss expenses is established based upon our estimate of the total cost of claims that were reported to us but not yet paid or  case reserves  the costs of additional case reserves on claims reported to us but not considered to be adequately reserved  or acr  and the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not reported or  ibnr 
for reported losses  we establish case reserves within the parameters of the coverage provided in the insurance or reinsurance contracts 
with respect to our insurance operations  we are notified of insured losses and record a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate expected liability arising from the claim 
the estimate reflects the judgment of claims personnel based on general reserving practices  the experience and knowledge of such personnel regarding the nature of the specific claim and  where appropriate  advice of counsel 
reserves are also established to provide for the estimated expense of settling claims  including legal and other fees and the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process 
with respect to our reinsurance operations  case reserves for reported claims are generally established based on reports received from ceding companies 
we may establish acr s to reflect the estimated ultimate cost of a loss 
loss reserving for catastrophe events is an inherently uncertain process 
when a catastrophe occurs  we review our exposures to determine which exposures will be impacted by the event 
we contact brokers and clients to determine their estimate of involvement and the extent to which their programs are affected 
in addition  we may also use computer modeling to estimate loss exposures under the actual event scenario 
we currently use risklink version licensed by rms  classic and catrader licensed by air and worldcat enterprise licensed by eqecat 
as part of the underwriting process  we obtain exposure data from our clients  so that when an event occurs we can run our models to produce an estimate of the losses incurred by clients on programs that we insure or reinsure 
typically  we derive our estimate for the losses from a catastrophic event by blending all of the sources of loss information available to us 
this estimate is derived by the claims team and is known as case ibnr 
generally  for catastrophic events there is considerable uncertainty underlying the assumptions and associated estimated reserves for losses and loss expenses 
reserves are reviewed quarterly and as experience develops and additional information is known  the reserves are adjusted as necessary 
such adjustments are reflected in the period in which they become known 
reinsurance operations by their nature add further complications to the reserving process  particularly for casualty business written  in that there is an inherent lag in the timing and reporting of a loss event from an insured or ceding company to the reinsurer 
this reporting lag creates an even longer period of time between the policy inception and when a claim is finally settled 
as a result  more prudence is required to establish reserves for ultimate claims in our reinsurance operations 
our ibnr is estimated by independent actuaries using actuarial methods 
our estimate of ibnr is initially derived using the bornhuetter ferguson method although the initial expected loss ratio and chain ladder loss emergence methods are also utilized for some lines of business 
the bornhuetter ferguson method is typically used by companies with limited loss experience 
this method takes as a starting point an assumed ultimate loss and loss expense ratio and blends in the loss and loss expense ratio implied by the experience to date 
for our global insurance and us insurance segments  the assumed ultimate loss and loss expense ratios are based on benchmarks derived from the independent actuary s wider market experience together with our limited historical data 
these benchmarks are then adjusted for rating increases and changes in terms and conditions that have been observed in the market and by us 
for our global reinsurance segment  the assumed ultimate loss and loss expense ratios are based on contract by contract initial expected loss ratios derived during pricing together with benchmarks derived from the independent actuary s wider market experience 
for our us reinsurance segment  the assumed ultimate loss and loss expense ratios are based on a review carried out by the independent actuaries of the pricing loss ratios on a contract by contract basis together with benchmarks derived from the independent actuary s wider market experience 
under us gaap  we are not permitted to establish loss reserves with respect to our catastrophe reinsurance until an event that gives rise to a loss occurs 
within our catastrophe line of business  on some contracts that respond to highly visible  major catastrophes  we are not holding any general ibnr although in certain cases we are holding case ibnr where potential exposure has been identified 
applying these loss and loss expense ratios to our earned premium derives the estimated baseline ultimate costs of the losses from which we deduct paid losses and reported case reserves to generate our baseline ibnr 
the actuarial methodologies used to derive our baseline estimate can not fully allow for all uncertainties within our business 
to account for some of these uncertainties  our independent actuaries have performed  in conjunction with management  an analysis of additional factors to be considered when establishing our ibnr 
these uncertainties may vary over time  but generally contemplate matters such as the timing and emergence of claims or short term market trends that might alter our otherwise consistent  baseline approach 
a combination of the baseline estimate of ibnr and the reserves for the additional uncertainties constitutes managements and the actuaries best estimate of ibnr 
the following table provides a breakdown of reserves for losses and loss expenses by segment by type of exposure as of december   and as of december  as of december  as of december  in millions marine  aviation and aerospace onshore and offshore energy and property other specialty risks total global insurance catastrophe property and non property credit and bond liability other total global reinsurance professional lines and liability property total u 
s insurance professional lines and liability property  marine and aviation total u 
s reinsurance total reserves for losses and loss expenses  as of december   the reserve for ibnr accounted for  million  or  of our total loss reserves 
the reserve for ibnr losses accounted for million  or  of our total loss reserves at december  and million  or  of our total loss reserves at december  the methodology of estimating loss reserves is reviewed each quarter to evaluate whether the assumptions made continue to be appropriate 
any adjustments that result from this review are recorded in the quarter in which they are identified 
our reserving practices and the establishment of any particular reserve reflect management s judgment concerning sound financial practice and do not represent any admission of liability with respect to any claims made against us 
no assurance can be given that actual claims made and related payments will not be in excess of the amounts reserved 
during the loss settlement period  it often becomes necessary to refine and adjust the estimates of liability on a claim either upward or downward 
even after such adjustments  ultimate liability may exceed or be less than the revised estimates 
in assessing the adequacy of these reserves it must be noted that the actual final costs of settling claims outstanding is uncertain as it depends upon future events 
there is necessarily a range of possible outcomes and the eventual outcome will almost certainly differ from the projections currently made 
this uncertainty is heightened by the short time in which we have operated  thereby providing limited claims loss emergence patterns specifically for the company 
this has necessitated the use of benchmarks in deriving ibnr which  despite management s and the independent actuary s care in selecting them  could differ materially from actual experience 
premiums 
our revenue is generated primarily by gross premiums written from our underwriting operations 
the basis for the amount of gross premiums recognized varies by the type of contract we write 
for the majority of our insurance business  we receive a flat premium which is identified in the policy and which is recorded as unearned premium on the inception date of the contract 
this premium will only adjust if the underlying insured values adjust 
we actively monitor underlying insured values and record adjustment premiums in the period in which amounts are reasonably determinable 
we also write business on a line slip basis  under which we assume a fixed percentage of the premiums and losses on a particular risk or group of risks along with numerous other unrelated insurers 
statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises requires that if the ultimate premium is reasonably estimable  the estimated ultimate premium should be recognized as revenue over the period of the contract 
although a premium estimate is not contractually stated for business written on a line slip basis  we believe that the premium is reasonably estimable because we receive an initial estimate of the expected premium written from the client via the broker 
this estimate has been derived by reference to one or more of the following the historical premium volume experienced by the line slip  historical premium volume of similar line slips  and industry information on the underlying business 
we may  if we believe appropriate  adjust the initial estimates provided by the broker to reflect management s best judgments and expectations 
this is most likely where the underwriter believes that the estimate is not prudent 
under these circumstances  we will generally recognize as revenue a lower than advised premium written estimate 
we actively monitor the development of actual reported premium to the estimates made  where actual reported premium deviates from the estimate  we carry out an analysis to determine the cause and may  if necessary  adjust the estimated premium in the period in which the determination was made 
during the years ended december   and  line slip premiums accounted for  and  respectively  of total gross premiums written 
for our reinsurance business  we write contracts on both an excess of loss basis and a proportional basis 
for excess of loss contracts  the amount of premium is usually contractually documented at inception and no management judgment is necessary 
for most such contracts  a deposit premium is generally contractually specified and is payable during the contract period 
after the contract has expired  a premium adjustment is calculated  which is based on the underlying exposure of the ceded business 
we record the deposit premium at the inception of the contract and record adjustments in the periods in which they are reasonably determinable 
for business written under a proportional contract  similar to our line slip business  we are able to reasonably estimate the premium written by reference to an initial estimate of expected ceded premium received from our clients 
in most cases  the treaties are not new and the client can use historical experience to estimate the amount of premium 
we may adjust the initial estimate of premium  and any adjustment is usually a result of the underwriter s prior experience with a client 
we actively monitor the development of actual premium data and  if an adjustment in the premium estimate is warranted  it will be recorded in the period during which the adjustment is determined 
during the years ended december   and  proportional premiums accounted for  and  respectively  of total gross premiums written 
our premiums are earned over the period during which we are exposed to the insured or reinsured risk 
generally  this period equates to the contract period  except for contracts written on a line slip or proportional basis 
for line slip and proportional business  the earning period is generally twice the contract period due to the fact that some of the underlying exposures may attach towards the end of our contracts  and such underlying exposures generally have a one year coverage period 
derivative contracts 
we underwrite certain contracts that have been determined to meet the definition of a derivative under fas  and are therefore recorded at their fair value 
we generally determine fair value using a cash flow model developed by us that is dependent upon several factors  including estimated future default rates  credit spreads  changes in credit quality and future recovery rates 
installment premiums are also considered in the determination of discounted net cash flows 
the change resulting from a movement in the fair value of such contracts is included in the statement of operations and comprehensive income in other insurance related income 
given the underlying nature of these contracts  there will be volatility in their fair value 
results of operations years ended december  and premiums 
in the year ended december   gross premiums written were billion compared with billion for the year ended december   an increase of billion 
of this increase  was generated by our global reinsurance segment  by our us insurance segment  by our us reinsurance segment and by our global insurance segment 
the increase in gross premiums written in our global reinsurance segment was primarily driven by our expansion into continental europe in november the increases in gross premiums written in our us segments were primarily due to greater market penetration and our ability to participate fully in the first quarter s renewal season 
the increase in gross premiums written in our global insurance segment was primarily driven by greater market penetration and new lines of business 
we expect the mix of business within and between our segments to change over time based on market conditions and our view of the long term profit potential of individual lines of business 
premiums ceded for the year ended december  were million compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
we purchase reinsurance to reduce our exposure to risk of loss on some lines of business written primarily within our global insurance and us insurance segments 
the increase in ceded premiums was generated primarily within these segments 
net premiums earned for the year ended december  were billion compared with billion for the year ended december   an increase of billion 
premiums are earned over the term of the policies in proportion to the risks to which they relate 
as the level of net premiums written increases  the level of net premiums earned also increases 
as we experienced an increase in net premiums written in all of our segments for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   our net premiums earned increased 
net investment income and net realized gains 
net investment income  including realized gains  for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
net investment income 
net investment income for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase was due to a combination of higher investment balances and higher investment yields 
the amount also included an additional charge for the amortization expense on our mortgage backed securities portfolio 
net investment income consisted primarily of interest on fixed income securities that was partially offset by net investment expenses of million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  the higher expenses were a result of an increase in our assets managed by external portfolio managers offset by securities lending income 
the annualized effective yield calculated by dividing the net investment income generated from invested assets by average balance of the assets managed by our portfolio managers for the year ended december  was compared with for the year ended december  the increase in the effective yield was primarily due to higher us interest rates at the short end of the yield curve 
the yield also was reduced by the additional charge for the amortization expense on our mortgage backed securities portfolio 
the yield may vary significantly from period to period due primarily to the timing of cash flows  changes in interest rates and changes in asset allocation 
net realized gains 
net realized gains for the year ended december  were million compared with million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
we invest our portfolios to produce a total return 
in assessing returns under this approach  we include investment income  realized gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses generated by the investment portfolios 
as a result  there can be significant changes in the levels of our net realized gains losses from quarter to quarter 
some of our mortgage backed securities are required to be classified as derivatives  included within net realized gains was million in realized gains associated with these securities 
the total return for our investment portfolio calculated using beginning and ending market portfolio values  adjusted for external cash flows for the year ended december  was compared with for the year ended december  the total return for an investment portfolio consists of price and income return 
these components will primarily be affected by the timing of cash flows  changes in interest rates and changes in asset allocation 
our total return for the year ended december  was similar to the previous year  however  the component returns were different 
in  we obtained a higher income return than in due to an increase in us interest rates at the short end of the yield curve  which resulted in higher portfolio yields 
this increase resulted in a negligible price return in compared to a positive price return in other insurance related income 
other insurance related income for the year ended december  was million compared with income of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
this income related to the movement in the fair value of our insurance and reinsurance contracts that met the definition of a derivative 
net losses and loss expenses 
net losses and loss expenses for the year ended december  were  million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the net loss and loss expense ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the increase in net losses and loss expenses and the net loss and loss expense ratio was primarily driven by an active hurricane season 
we incurred net losses and loss expenses of million from hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne  which swept across the caribbean and south eastern united states in august and september our estimates for the losses incurred from these hurricanes were derived from formal loss advices  the output of industry models  a review of in force contracts and preliminary indications from clients 
consequently  actual losses from these hurricanes may vary materially from estimated losses 
as at december   the company had million included within our net ibnr specifically for the hurricane losses 
during the year ended december   we did not experience a major loss as a result of hurricane activity 
the impact of the hurricane related losses was partially mitigated by favorable prior period development of million  or percentage points  compared to million  or percentage points  for the year ended december  acquisition costs 
acquisition costs for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase was primarily a result of the increase in the volume of gross premiums earned 
the acquisition cost ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from an increase in the acquisition cost ratio from our global insurance segment 
with effect from january   we included the personnel expenses of our underwriters in general and administrative expenses  prior to that date  they were included in acquisition costs 
our disclosures for prior periods have been restated to reflect this change 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase was primarily driven by the establishment and expansion of operations in europe and the us in addition  we incurred million of fees in connection with our preparation for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of following the adoption of financial accounting standard no 
 we began to expense stock options and stock awards over the vesting period using the fair value method 
for the year ended december   we expensed million compared to million for the year ended december  the general and administrative expense ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the ratio was caused by an increase in the volume of net premiums earned 
foreign exchange 
our functional currency is the us dollar  however  some of our business is written in other currencies 
for the year ended december   we experienced a gain of million compared to a gain of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
while the euro and sterling appreciated by and  respectively  in  these increases were less than the appreciation experienced by these currencies in and  therefore  our gains were less than in interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense consists of interest due on outstanding debt  the amortization of debt offering expenses and offering discounts and fees relating to our credit facility 
the increase of million was due to the issuance of senior unsecured debt in november  which bears interest at a rate of per annum 
income tax expense 
the income tax expense for the year ended december  was million compared to an income tax recovery million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this was due to an increase in the level of taxable income generated by our european subsidiaries 
net income 
net income for the year ended december  was million compared to million  a decrease of million 
net income for the year ended december  consisted of net underwriting income of million  net investment income and net realized gains of million  corporate expenses of million  foreign exchange gains of million  interest expense of million and tax expense of million 
net income for the year ended december  consisted of net underwriting income of million  net investment income and net realized gains of million  corporate expenses of million  foreign exchange gains of million  interest expense of million and an income tax recovery of million 
comprehensive income 
comprehensive income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
comprehensive income represents net income adjusted for changes in the unrealized position in our investment portfolio 
for the year ended december   we experienced a decrease of million in the unrealized position in our investment portfolio compared to a negligible decrease during the year ended december  years ended december  and premiums 
in the year ended december   gross premiums written were billion compared with billion for the year ended december   an increase of billion 
of this increase  was generated by our us insurance and reinsurance segments  which began underwriting business at the start of our calendar year and produced gross premiums written of million and million  respectively 
in addition  we experienced an increase in gross premiums written of million from our global insurance segment and million from our global reinsurance segment 
we expect the mix of business within and between our segments to change over time based on market conditions and our view of the long term profit potential of individual lines of business 
premiums ceded for the year ended december  were million compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
we purchase reinsurance to reduce our exposure to risk of loss on some lines of business written primarily within our global insurance and us insurance segments 
the increase in ceded premiums was primarily generated by our us insurance segment 
net premiums earned for the year ended december  were billion compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase was caused by two factors 
firstly  we increased the volume of premiums written during the year ended december  over secondly  as the year ended december  was our first full underwriting year  premiums were earned only on contracts written following the commencement of operations in november of through the end of december for the year ended december   we earned premiums on contracts written in both and net investment income and net realized gains losses 
net investment income  including realized gains  for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
net investment income 
net investment income for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this was primarily due to higher investment balances partially offset by lower interest rates and an increase in the amortization expense on our mortgage backed securities portfolio 
net investment income consisted primarily of interest on fixed income securities that was partially offset by investment fees of million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  the higher fees were a result of an increase in our assets managed by third party portfolio managers 
the annualized effective yield calculated by dividing the net investment income generated from invested assets by the average balance of the assets managed by our portfolio managers for the year ended december  was compared with for the year ended december  the reduction in the effective yield was primarily due to lower us interest rates and a larger allocation to shorter duration investments during part of the year 
net realized gains 
net realized gains for the year ended december  were million compared with million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
we invest our portfolios to produce a total return 
in assessing returns under this approach  we include investment income  realized gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses generated by the investment portfolios 
as a result  there can be significant changes in the levels of our net realized gains losses from year to year 
with effect from july   we adopted fas no 
amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
as a result  some of our mortgage backed securities are required to be classified as derivatives and the unrealized gains losses associated with these securities that were previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are now recorded in net realized gains losses 
at december   there were no mortgage backed securities classified as derivatives held in the investment portfolio 
for the year ended december   included within net realized gains were million in realized losses  and no unrealized gains or losses relating to these securities 
the total return for our investment portfolio calculated using beginning and ending market portfolio values  adjusted for external cash flows for the year ended december  was compared with for the year ended december  the total return for an investment portfolio consists of price and income return 
our total return was lower in due to a combination of lower absolute yields achieved resulting in lower income return and a lower price return achieved due to the volatile interest rate environment in other insurance related income loss

this increase was a result of the increase in the volume of net premiums earned 
the acquisition cost ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  this decrease resulted primarily from the effects of a change in business mix  our us insurance segment  which began underwriting in  has a lower acquisition cost ratio than our other segments due to the receipt of ceding commissions on some ceded contracts that are recorded as an offset to acquisition costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase was primarily driven by the addition of operations and employees in the us and europe

for the year ended december   we experienced a negligible net decrease in the unrealized position in our investment portfolio compared to an increase of million during the year ended december  underwriting results by segment our business consists of four underwriting segments global insurance  global reinsurance  us insurance and us reinsurance 
we evaluate the performance of each underwriting segment based on underwriting results 
with effect from january   we included the personnel expenses of our underwriters in general and administrative expenses  prior to that date  they were included in acquisition costs 
disclosures relating to prior periods have been restated to reflect this change 
in addition  with effect from january   we allocated all of our general and administrative costs  except for corporate expenses  to our underwriting segments 
our corporate costs include holding company costs necessary to support our worldwide insurance and reinsurance operations and costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
we have not restated prior periods to reflect the full allocation of general and administrative costs as our business segments were not fully operational throughout we do not allocate our assets by segment as we evaluate the underwriting results of each segment separately from the results of our investment portfolio 
global insurance our global insurance segment principally consists of specialty lines business sourced outside of the us but covering exposures throughout the world 
in this segment  we offer clients tailored solutions in order to respond to their distinctive risk characteristics 
since most of the lines in this segment are for physical damage and related perils and not for liability coverage  the segment is principally short to medium tail business 
this means that claims are generally made and settled earlier than in long tail business

this increase was generated by three lines of business aviation war  directors and officers liability insurance and political risk 
our aviation war gross premiums written increased million due to increased participations on renewed business and new business 
our directors and officers liability gross premiums written increased by million  reflecting our entry into this line of business in the second half of our political risk gross premiums written increased by million due to an increase in the level of direct foreign investment and an increased targeting of this business 
property gross premiums written increased by million  due primarily to the restructuring of existing participations on renewed business and some new business  which offset the effects of rate reductions 
our marine book experienced an increase in gross premiums written of million due to the recruitment of a cargo specie underwriting team that began to underwrite premiums in the second quarter of this increase was offset by a reduction in our marine liability business due primarily to our decision not to renew some contracts 
our energy book experienced a decrease in gross premiums written of million or 
this was the result of a combination of shifting renewal dates  rate reductions and our decision not to renew some business 
gross premiums written on our aviation book remained constant despite our decision not to renew some major accounts  although rates declined in this book of business  gross premiums written remained at a consistent level due to an increase in the level of insured exposures 
premiums ceded for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in the level of reinsurance purchased in order to mitigate volatility in losses as our portfolio grows 
in addition  included in written premiums ceded for the year ended december  was million related to reinstatement premiums on coverages exhausted by losses  primarily emanating from hurricanes frances and ivan 
the following table shows the derivation of net premiums earned for the years ended december  and december  year ended december  year ended december  in thousands gross premiums earned   ceded premiums amortized   net premiums earned   gross premiums are earned over the period of the insured risk 
consequently  the level of gross premiums earned increased as the level of gross premiums written increased 
ceded premiums are amortized over the contract term 
consequently  the level of amortized ceded premium increased in as premiums ceded in continued to be amortized in we expect the level of amortized ceded premium to continue to increase in other insurance related income 
other insurance related income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million

these losses primarily accounted for the increase in the level of reported case reserves 
our estimates for the losses incurred from these hurricanes were derived from formal loss advices  the output of industry models  a review of in force contracts and preliminary indications from clients 
consequently  actual losses from these hurricanes may vary materially from estimated losses 
the increase in our reinsurance recoveries was primarily driven by recoveries of million from losses caused by hurricanes frances and ivan 
during the year ended december   we experienced favorable development on our prior accident years of million compared to million during the year ended december  this reduced the net loss ratio by percentage points for the year ended december  and percentage points for the year ended december  we primarily use the bornhuetter ferguson method to estimate the ultimate cost of losses  it takes as a starting point an assumed ultimate loss and loss expense ratio and blends in the loss and loss expense ratio implied by the experience to date 
if actual claims are less than expected  this generates favorable loss development 
during the year ended december   the favorable development was generated primarily on our accident year and was derived from our energy  property  terrorism and aviation war lines of business

acquisition costs 
acquisition costs for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the acquisition cost ratio for the year ended december  was compared with for the year ended december  the increase in the acquisition cost ratio was partially caused by higher amortized reinsurance costs  which reduced the level of net premiums earned

these increases were partially the result of the addition of underwriting staff in the second quarter of  which enabled us to improve our market penetration at key renewal dates in in addition  the continuing flight to quality led to improved market penetration 
our marine book generated an increase in gross premiums written of million 
this was primarily derived from the marine liability business where we experienced an increase in the number of contracts and improvements in rates 
gross premiums written in our onshore and offshore energy book increased by million 
this was partially generated by the expiration of multi year deals with other carriers  which allowed us to participate on new contracts in our aviation and aerospace book experienced an increase in gross premiums written of million 
this was generated from our core aviation risks  which include hull and liability risks for passenger and cargo airlines and privately owned aircraft  and two large product liability accounts 
rates within the airline market stabilized at a good level in the last quarter of driven by a withdrawal of capacity from the market 
gross premium written within our property line of business increased by million partially due to greater penetration  which resulted in the addition of several new property accounts 
our specialty risks book generated an increase of million in gross premiums written primarily due to an increase in the level of political risk business following a rise in the level of direct foreign investment and an increase in the level of aviation war business due to greater penetration on our aviation hull and liability books 
this increase offset the reduction in our terrorism book caused by the effects of tria and heightened competition for the business outside of tria 
premiums ceded for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the decrease was due to timing  with a significant reinsurance policy that incepted in the third quarter of having a sixteen month coverage period and  therefore  not renewing until the first quarter of the following table shows the derivation of net premiums earned for the years ended december  and december  year ended december  year ended december  in thousands gross premiums earned   ceded premiums amortized   net premiums earned   gross premiums are earned over the period of the insured risk

this reduction was primarily generated by our marine  aviation war  energy and property lines of business 
we use the bornhuetter ferguson method to estimate the ultimate cost of losses  it takes as a starting point an assumed ultimate loss and loss expense ratio and blends in the loss and loss expense ratio implied by the experience to date 
during the year ended december   the lack of reported claims on our marine  aviation war  energy and property lines of business produced a favorable impact on our experience to date  which caused a reduction in the ultimate losses for these lines of business 
a comparison of the net loss ratios for the year ended december  and december  is distorted by the significant change in the mix of business written within our global insurance segment

our bermuda office primarily sources business from clients based outside continental europe whereas our zurich office sources business from clients based in continental europe 
our bermuda based portfolio consists of short tail severity driven products that principally cover property exposures 
our zurich based portfolio consists not only of short tail property exposures but also more medium tail exposures such as motor excess of loss and trade credit lines of business 
as the majority of this segment s business is short tail in nature  it typically allows us to determine the ultimate loss experience within a relatively short period of time after a contract has expired

our catastrophe book of business generated an increase in gross premiums written of million 
this was driven by a trend toward counterparty diversification in our target markets  which enabled us to participate on a greater number of programs than in the prior year  this offset some moderate rate reductions and instances where we declined to renew contracts because terms and conditions became unacceptable 
the increase in our property pro rata and property per risk gross premiums written of million and million  respectively  was primarily due to an increase in the number of contracts written

our estimates for the losses incurred from these hurricanes were derived from formal loss advices  the output of industry models  a review of in force contracts and preliminary indications from clients 
consequently  actual losses from these hurricanes may vary materially from estimated losses 
our gross losses were reduced by reinsurance recoveries that were triggered by the occurrence of a series of large industry loss events 
recoveries under our reinsurance are dependent on industry losses  which are calculated by independent third parties  exceeding predetermined trigger points 
our assessment  based on a combination of public information  our own analysis of each loss and historical development factors  is that these trigger points have been exceeded 
however  not all of the industry loss numbers have been finally determined  and actual reinsurance recoveries could be materially reduced

our property book generated gross premiums written of million during the year ended december   an increase of over the year ended december  this was primarily due to four reasons first  we introduced a new product line in mid  second  we increased our maximum line sizes  which enabled our underwriters to access more business  third  we increased the number of states in which we were able to write business on a non admitted basis  and fourth  we increased our market penetration 
our liability book generated gross premiums written of million during the year ended december   an increase of over the year ended december  this was primarily driven by an increase in our maximum line size for our umbrella and excess coverages  which enabled our underwriters to access more business  and increased market penetration 
our professional lines book generated gross premiums written of million during the year ended december   an increase of over the year ended december  this was primarily driven by the fact that we did not acquire the renewal rights of a book of directors and officers liability insurance and related lines of business written by the fis group of kemper until february  included within the gross premiums written for the year ended december  was million relating to the cancel rewrite process that followed the acquisition of the renewal rights 
gross premiums written for the year ended december  included million of gross premiums written on a new line of business errors and omissions insurance for professional institutions

our us insurance segment purchases significant proportional and excess of loss reinsurance on both a treaty and facultative basis that is designed to reduce the volatility in our severity driven classes of business 
as a result  as the total of our gross premiums written increases so does the total of our premiums ceded

in the year ended december   gross premiums written were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the table below shows gross premiums written by line of business year ended december  year ended december  in thousands professional lines   liability   property   marine and aviation   total   during the year ended december   our gross premiums written increased by over the year ended december  this increase was primarily generated by our professional lines book  which generated gross premiums written of million during the year ended december   an increase of over the year ended december  our liability book generated gross premiums written of million during the year ended december   an increase of over the year ended december  these increases were primarily generated by our ability to quote and write contracts that came up for renewal on january  in  we were unable to take part in the january  renewal season because we did not receive regulatory approvals until mid december in addition  we increased the statutory capital of axis reinsurance at the end of the first quarter of to in excess of million  which enabled us to participate on more business 
we wrote million of gross premiums relating to property reinsurance during the year ended december   an increase of over the year ended december  this was driven by the recruitment of a property underwriter in the second half of premiums ceded for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the following table shows the derivation of net premiums earned year ended december  year ended december  in thousands gross premiums earned   ceded premiums amortized   net premiums earned   gross premiums are earned over the period of the insured risk 
consequently  the level of earned premiums increased as premiums written throughout continued to be earned in in addition  a large portion of premiums written in were on a risk attaching basis  for which the earning period is twice the underlying contract period 
consequently  a significant proportion of the gross premiums was earned on these contracts in net losses and loss expenses 
net losses and loss expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the following table shows the components of net losses and loss expenses incurred year ended december  year ended december  in thousands gross losses paid   reinsurance recoveries received net losses paid   change in reported case reserves   change in ibnr   reinsurance recoveries on unpaid loss and loss expense reserves  the net loss and loss expense ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the increase in losses paid and change in reported case reserves resulted from losses incurred on hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne from which we incurred net losses and loss expenses of million  or percentage points 
these losses were derived from our property books of business 
our estimates for the losses incurred from these hurricanes were derived from formal loss advices  the output of industry models  a review of in force contracts and preliminary indications from clients 
consequently  actual losses from these hurricanes may vary materially from estimated losses 
we experienced positive prior period development of million  or percentage points  generated on our accident year property account 
we primarily use the bornhuetter ferguson method to estimate the ultimate cost of losses  it takes as a starting point an assumed loss and loss expense ratio and blends in the loss and loss expense ratio implied by our experience to date 
during the year ended december   there was a lack of claims in our accident year property account that caused the reduction in expected losses 
acquisition costs 
acquisition costs for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the acquisition cost ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the general and administrative expenses ratio for the year ended december  was compared with for the year ended december  as we did not allocate any of our general and administrative expenses  except for the personnel expenses of our underwriters  prior to january   these amounts and ratios are not comparable 
financial condition and liquidity we are a holding company and have no substantial operations of our own 
our assets consist primarily of our investments in subsidiaries 
at december   we had operating subsidiaries in bermuda  ireland and the united states  a branch and representative office in the united kingdom  a branch in switzerland and a representative office in singapore 
accordingly  our future cash flows depend upon the availability of dividends or other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries 
the ability to pay dividends is limited by the applicable laws and regulations of bermuda  ireland and the united states  which subject our insurance subsidiaries to significant regulatory restrictions 
these laws and regulations require  among other things  some of our insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends that these subsidiaries can pay to us  which in turn may limit our ability to pay dividends and make other payments 
additionally  we are subject to bermuda regulatory constraints that affect our ability to pay dividends on our common shares and make other payments 
under the companies act  axis capital may declare or pay a dividend or make a distribution out of contributed surplus only if it has no reasonable grounds for believing that it is  or would after the payment be  unable to pay its liabilities as they become due or that the realizable value of its assets would thereby be less than the aggregate of our liabilities and issued share capital and share premium accounts 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of our credit agreement  we cannot pay cash dividends to our shareholders in excess of million in the aggregate during any fiscal year 
at december   the maximum amount of distributions that our subsidiaries could pay to axis capital under applicable laws and regulations without prior regulatory approval was approximately billion 
financial condition at december   total investments at fair market value  accrued interest receivable and cash net of unsettled investment trades were billion  compared to billion at december  our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities at december  and was managed by several external investment management firms 
at december   all of these fixed income securities were investment grade  with rated aa or aa or better by an internationally recognized rating agency 
the weighted average rating of our fixed income portfolio was aa based on ratings assigned by standard poor s 
the net payable for investments purchased at december  was million compared to a net receivable of million at december  net receivables payables are a result of timing differences only  as investments are accounted for on a trade date basis 
at december   we had million of insurance and reinsurance premium balances receivable compared to million at december  this increase was due to the level of gross premium written during the year ended december  at december   we had prepaid reinsurance of million  an increase of million since december   following an increase in the level of reinsurance purchased primarily by our global insurance and u 
s insurance segments 
at december   we had reinsurance recoverable balances and reinsurance recoverable balances on paid losses of million  an increase of million since december   following loss recoveries of million from hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne 
loss recoveries relating to the hurricanes were from reinsurers  of which were rated the equivalent of a or better by internationally recognized rating agencies 
at december   we had billion of reserves for loss and loss expenses compared to billion at december   an increase of billion 
of this balance  billion  or  was incurred but not reported reserves 
at december   our shareholders equity was billion compared to billion at december   an increase of 
this increase was primarily due to net income of million for the year ended december   offset by a million decrease in the unrealized appreciation on our investment portfolio during the same period 
liquidity our cash flows from operations generally represent the difference between premiums collected  reinsurance recoveries and investment earnings realized and losses and loss expenses paid  reinsurance purchased and underwriting and other expenses paid 
cash flows from operations may differ substantially  however  from net income 
the potential for a large claim under one of our insurance or reinsurance contracts means that substantial and unpredictable payments may need to be made within relatively short periods of time 
in the year ended december   we generated a net operating cash inflow of billion  primarily relating to premiums received and investment income 
during the same period we paid gross losses of million and received reinsurance recoveries of million 
we invested a net cash amount of  million during the period  and at december  had a cash balance of million 
during the year ended december   net cash of million was generated from financing activities 
we paid dividends of million  and raised million from a senior note offering 
in the year ended december   we generated a net operating cash inflow of billion  primarily relating to premiums received and investment income 
during the same period we paid losses of million 
during the year ended december   net cash of million was generated from financing activities 
we paid dividends of million and raised net proceeds of million from our initial public offering 
we invested a net cash amount of billion  and at december  had a cash balance of million 
we declared four quarterly dividends of per common share 
the dividends were payable on april   july   october  and january  during  we declared two quarterly dividends of per common share 
the dividends were payable on october  and january  on april   we completed a secondary public offering of  common shares held by some of our founding shareholders at a price of per share 
on april   we completed a secondary public offering of  common shares to cover over allotments 
we did not sell any common shares in connection with the registration and did not receive any proceeds from the offering 
on an ongoing basis  our sources of funds primarily consist of premiums written  reinsurance recoveries  investment income and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments 
cash is used primarily to pay losses and loss expenses  reinsurance premiums  acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses  to purchase new investments and to fund dividend and interest payments 
capital resources on march   we renewed our credit facility by entering into a three year million credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks led by jpmorgan chase bank  as administrative agent and lender 
under the terms of the new credit facility  up to million may be used by axis capital  axis specialty  axis re  axis specialty europe  axis reinsurance  axis insurance and axis surplus to issue letters of credit and up to million may be used by these entities for general corporate purposes  with total borrowings not to exceed million 
the credit facility contains various loan covenants with which we must comply  including limitations on the incurrence of future indebtedness  future liens  fundamental changes  investments and certain transactions with affiliates 
the credit facility also requires that we maintain a minimum amount of consolidated shareholders equity equal to or greater than the sum of billion plus a of consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter beginning with the fiscal quarter ending march  and b of the net cash proceeds received after march  from any issuance of our capital stock and a debt to total capitalization ratio not greater than 
the credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to make acquisitions  except that we may  among other things  acquire assets and entities in the insurance and reinsurance business for consideration in an aggregate amount not in excess of million 
our ability to pay dividends or make other restricted payments is also limited  except that we may  among other things  pay cash dividends to our shareholders in an amount not exceeding million for any fiscal year and we may repurchase shares of our capital stock for consideration in an aggregate amount not exceeding million 
at december   we had no outstanding indebtedness and letters of credit of million outstanding under the credit facility 
as at december   we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit facility 
on november   we completed a public offering of million of senior notes 
the notes bear interest at  payable semi annually and  unless previously redeemed  will mature on december  on december   we announced that our board had authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common shares 
on february   we repurchased  common shares owned by initial investors at the formation of the company pursuant to our repurchase program 
the average purchase price was per common share and the aggregate purchase price was million  which exhausted our repurchase program 
commitments we did not make any significant capital expenditures during the year ended december  we currently expect capital expenditures for to be less than million 
the following table provides an analysis of our contractual obligations at december  payment due by period expressed in thousands of us dollars total less than year years years more than years reserve for losses and loss expenses    senior notes including interest payments    operating lease obligations     other investments   our reserves for losses and loss expense consist of case reserves  acr and ibnr 
in assessing the adequacy of these reserves  it must be noted that the actual costs of settling claims is uncertain as it depends upon future events 
many of these events will be out of our control and could potentially affect the ultimate liability and timing of any potential payment 
there is necessarily a range of possible outcomes and the eventual outcome will certainly differ from the projections currently made 
this uncertainty is heightened by the short time in which we have operated  thereby providing limited company specific claims loss emergence patterns 
consequently  we must use industry benchmarks  on a line by line basis  in deriving ibnr which  despite management s and our independent actuary s care in selecting them  will differ from actual experience 
similarly  we have limited loss payout pattern information specific to our experience  therefore we have used industry data  on a line by line basis  to estimate our expected payments 
consequently  despite management s and our independent actuary s care in selecting them  the actual payment of our reserve for losses and loss expenses will differ from estimated payouts 
on november  we signed a letter of intent for a proposed acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of a wisconsin domiciled insurance company 
the purchase price will be based on market value of the statutory capital and surplus at the date of acquisition and a sum equating to the value of the number of insurance licenses acquired 
the acquisition is subject to the completion of a definitive agreement and necessary regulatory approvals 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to potential loss on our investment portfolio from various market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  and from credit risk 
our investment portfolio primarily consists of fixed income securities denominated in both us and foreign currencies 
external investment professionals manage our portfolio under the direction of our management in accordance with detailed investment guidelines provided by us 
our guidelines do not currently permit the use of derivatives other than foreign currency forward contracts 
in the future  we may change our guidelines to permit the use of derivatives 
interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of fixed income securities included in our investment portfolio 
as interest rates rise  the market value of our fixed income portfolio falls  and the converse is also true 
we manage interest rate risk by selecting investments with characteristics such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of our insurance and reinsurance liabilities 
our current duration target for our investments is two to four years 
the duration of an investment is based on the maturity of the security and also reflects the payment of interest and the possibility of early principal payment of such security 
we seek to utilize investment benchmarks that reflect this duration target 
management periodically revises our investment benchmarks based on business and economic conditions  including the average duration of our potential liabilities 
at december   our invested assets assets under management by external investment managers had an approximate duration of years 
at december   we held  million at fair market value  or of our total invested assets  in mortgage backed securities compared to  million  or  at december  when interest rates decline  these assets are exposed to prepayment risk  which occurs when holders of underlying mortgages increase the frequency with which they prepay the outstanding principal before the maturity date and refinance at a lower interest rate cost 
when interest rates increase  these assets are exposed to extension risk  which occurs when holders of underlying mortgages reduce the frequency on which they prepay the outstanding principal before the maturity date and delay any refinancing of the outstanding principal 
we have calculated the effect that an immediate parallel shift in the us interest rate yield curve would have on our assets under management by third party investment managers at december  the modeling of this effect was performed on each security individually using the security s effective duration and changes in prepayment expectations for mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
the results of this analysis are summarized in the table below 
interest rate movement analysis on market value of assets under management by external investment managers interest rate shift in basis points expressed in thousands of us dollars total market value     market value change from base change in unrealized value     foreign currency risk 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of fixed income securities and other investments included in our investment portfolios that are denominated in those currencies 
therefore  we attempt to manage our foreign currency risk by seeking to match our liabilities under insurance and reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with investments that are denominated in such currencies 
furthermore  we may use foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to hedge against movements in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and to gain exposure to interest rate differentials between differing market rates 
a foreign currency forward contract involves an obligation to purchase or sell a specified currency at a future date at a price set at the time of the contract 
foreign currency forward contracts will not eliminate fluctuations in the value of our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but rather allow us to establish a rate of exchange for a future point in time 
we do not expect to enter into such contracts with respect to a material amount of our assets 
foreign currency forward contracts purchased are not specifically identifiable against cash  any single security or any groups of securities and  therefore  do not qualify and are not designated as a hedge for financial reporting purposes 
all realized gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in our statements of operations and comprehensive income 
at december   the net contractual amount of foreign currency forward contracts was million with an unrealized loss of million 
at december   the net contractual amount of foreign currency forward contracts was million with a negligible fair market value 
at december   we had insurance and reinsurance premium balances receivable of million compared to million at december  of this balance  was denominated in us dollars 
of the remaining balance  was denominated in euro and in sterling 
a increase or decrease in the value of the euro and sterling currencies against the us dollar would produce a gain or loss of approximately million  compared to million at december  credit risk 
we have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities 
our risk management strategy and investment policy is to invest in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to particular ratings categories and any one issuer 
we attempt to limit our credit exposure by purchasing fixed income investments rated bbb baa or higher 
in addition  we have limited our exposure to any single corporate issuer to or less of our portfolio for securities rated a a or above and or less of our portfolio for securities rated between bbb baa and bbb baa at december   we did not have an aggregate exposure to any single issuer of more than of our portfolio  other than with respect to us government and agency securities 
in addition  we have credit risk under some contracts where we receive premiums in return for assuming the risk of default on pre determined portfolios of sovereign and corporate obligations 
value at risk 
our management uses value at risk var as one of its tools to measure potential losses in fair market values of our investment portfolio 
the var calculation is calculated by a third party provider and reviewed by management 
var uses a monte carlo simulation to project many different prices of fixed income securities  derivatives and currencies taking into account  among other things  the volatility and the correlation between security price changes over various forecast horizons 
the var of our investment portfolio at december  was approximately million compared to million at december   which represents the potential loss in fair market value of our investment portfolio over a one year time horizon within a confidence level 
this increase was primarily due to a higher overall investment balances offset by slightly shorter duration risk 
the var computation is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair market value 
we cannot predict actual future movements in market rates and do not present these results to be indicative of future movements in such market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future results of operations or financial position 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates 
the potential exists  after a catastrophe loss  for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy 
the anticipated effects on us are considered in our catastrophe loss models 
the effects of inflation are also considered in pricing and in estimating reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses 
the actual effects of inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled 
risk factors any of the risks described below could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
risks related to the company our future performance is difficult to predict because we have a limited operating history 
we began our business in november and have a limited operating and financial history 
as a result  there is limited historical financial and operating information available to help you evaluate our performance 
because we are in the early stages of development  we face substantial business and financial risks and may suffer significant losses 
we must continue to develop and maintain business relationships  operating procedures  management information and other systems and complete other tasks necessary to conduct our intended business activities 
it is possible that we will not be successful in implementing our business strategy or accomplishing these necessary tasks 
our financial condition could be adversely affected by the occurrence of natural and man made disasters 
we have substantial exposure to unexpected losses resulting from natural disasters  man made catastrophes and other catastrophic events 
catastrophes can be caused by various events  including hurricanes  earthquakes  hailstorms  explosions  severe winter weather  fires  war  acts of terrorism  political instability and other natural or man made disasters 
in addition  we have written and will continue to write policies explicitly covering war  acts of terrorism and political risk 
the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and our losses from catastrophes could be substantial 
the occurrence of claims from catastrophic events is likely to result in substantial volatility in our results of operations or financial condition for any fiscal quarter or year 
this volatility is compounded by accounting regulations that do not permit reinsurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur 
increases in the values and concentrations of insured property may increase the severity of these occurrences in the future 
although we attempt to manage our exposure to such events  a single catastrophic event could affect multiple geographic zones or the frequency or severity of catastrophic events could exceed our estimates 
as a result  the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to write new business 
if actual claims exceed our loss reserves  our financial results could be significantly adversely affected 
our results of operations and financial condition depend upon our ability to assess accurately the potential losses associated with the risks that we insure and reinsure 
we establish loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the policies that we write 
our operating history is too limited and our loss history is insufficient to allow us currently to extrapolate reserves directly 
instead  our current loss reserves are based on estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections of our expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of claims incurred but not reported 
we utilize actuarial models and historical insurance industry loss development patterns to establish appropriate loss reserves  as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity  frequency and other factors 
establishing an appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process 
accordingly  actual claims and claim expenses paid will likely deviate  perhaps substantially  from the reserve estimates reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
if our loss reserves are determined to be inadequate  we will be required to increase loss reserves at the time of such determination and our net income will be reduced 
in addition  we could incur an operating loss and a reduction of our capital 
the failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
we seek to mitigate our loss exposure by writing a number of our insurance and reinsurance contracts on an excess of loss basis 
excess of loss insurance and reinsurance indemnifies the insured against losses in excess of a specified amount 
in addition  we limit program size for each client and purchase reinsurance for our own account 
in the case of proportional reinsurance treaties  we seek per occurrence limitations or loss and loss expense ratio caps to limit the impact of losses from any one event 
in proportional reinsurance  the reinsurer shares a proportional part of the premiums and losses of the reinsured 
we cannot be sure that any of these loss limitation methods will be effective 
we also seek to limit our loss exposure by geographic diversification 
geographic zone limitations involve significant underwriting judgments  including the determination of the area of the zones and the inclusion of a particular policy within a particular zone s limits 
various provisions of our policies  such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum negotiated to limit our risks may not be enforceable in the manner we intend 
as a result of these risks  one or more catastrophic or other events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social and other environmental conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge 
these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
in some instances  these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes 
as a result  the full extent of liability under our insurance or reinsurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued 
one recent example of an emerging claims and coverage issue is larger settlements and jury awards against professionals and corporate directors and officers covered by professional liability and directors and officers liability insurance 
the risk associated with reinsurance underwriting could adversely affect us 
in our reinsurance business  we do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under reinsurance treaties 
this is common among reinsurers 
therefore  we are largely dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by insurers that reinsure their liabilities  or ceding companies 
we are subject to the risk that the ceding companies may not have adequately evaluated the risks to be reinsured and that the premiums ceded may not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume 
we could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more key executives or by an inability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
our success depends on our ability to retain the services of our existing key executives and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future 
the loss of the services of any of our key executives or the inability to hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 
we do not maintain key man life insurance policies with respect to our employees  except for our chief executive officer and president  john r 
charman 
under bermuda law  non bermudians other than spouses of bermudians  holders of a permanent resident s certificate or holders of a working resident s certificate may not engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without an appropriate governmental work permit 
work permits may be granted or extended by the bermuda government only upon showing that  after proper public advertisement in most cases  no bermudian or spouse of a bermudian  holder of a permanent resident s certificate or holder of a working resident s certificate is available who meets the minimum standard requirements for the advertised position 
in  the bermuda government announced a new immigration policy limiting the duration of work permits to between six and nine years  with specified exemptions for key employees 
if work permits are not obtained or renewed for our key executives in bermuda  we could lose their services  which could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 
our operating subsidiaries are rated by standard poor s  am best and moodys and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing among brokers and customers and cause our sales and earnings to decrease 
ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies 
our insurance subsidiaries have been rated a strong by standard poor s  which is the sixth highest of twenty one rating levels  and a excellent by am best  which is the third highest of fifteen rating levels 
axis specialty  axis re and axis reinsurance are rated a good by moody s investors service  which is the sixth highest of ratings 
our ratings are subject to periodic review by  and may be revised downward or revoked at the sole discretion of  the rating agency 
if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by any rating agency  our competitive position in the insurance and reinsurance industry would suffer  and it would be more difficult for us to market our products 
a downgrade  therefore  could result in a substantial loss of business as insureds  ceding companies and brokers move to other insurers and reinsurers with higher ratings 
in addition  we will be in default of our credit facility if any of axis specialty  axis re  axis specialty europe  axis reinsurance  axis insurance or axis surplus fails to maintain a rating of at least b from am best 
since we depend on a few brokers for a large portion of our revenues  loss of business provided by any one of them could adversely affect us 
we market our insurance and reinsurance worldwide primarily through insurance and reinsurance brokers 
marsh  inc  including its subsidiary guy carpenter company  inc  aon corporation  willis group holdings ltd  benfield group and jardine lloyd thompson provided   and for a total of  respectively  of our gross premiums written in the year ended december  we believe these brokers also have  or may in the future acquire  ownership interests in insurance and reinsurance companies that may compete with us 
loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our reliance on brokers subjects us to their credit risk 
in accordance with industry practice  we generally pay amounts owed on claims under our insurance and reinsurance contracts to brokers  and these brokers  in turn  pay these amounts over to the clients that have purchased insurance or reinsurance from us 
although the law is unsettled and depends upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case  in some jurisdictions  if a broker fails to make such a payment  we might remain liable to the insured or ceding insurer for the deficiency 
conversely  in certain jurisdictions  when the insured or ceding insurer pays premiums for these policies to brokers for payment over to us  these premiums might be considered to have been paid and the insured or ceding insurer will no longer be liable to us for those amounts  whether or not we have actually received the premiums from the broker 
consequently  we assume a degree of credit risk associated with brokers with whom we transact business 
however  due to the unsettled and fact specific nature of the law  we are unable to quantify our exposure to this risk 
to date  we have not experienced any material losses related to these credit risks 
if we choose to purchase reinsurance  we may be unable to do so  and if we successfully purchase reinsurance  we may be unable to collect 
we purchase reinsurance for our own account in order to mitigate the volatility of losses upon our financial condition 
a reinsurer s insolvency  or inability or refusal to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with us  could have a material adverse effect on us because we remain liable to the insured 
from time to time  market conditions have limited  and in some cases have prevented  insurers and reinsurers from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance that they consider adequate for their business needs 
for example  following the tragic events of september   terms and conditions in the reinsurance and retrocessional markets generally became less attractive 
in retrocessional reinsurance  a reinsurer cedes to another reinsurer all or part of the reinsurance that was originally assumed 
accordingly  we may not be able to obtain our desired amounts of reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance 
in addition  even if we are able to obtain such reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance  we may not be able to negotiate terms that we deem appropriate or acceptable or obtain such reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance from entities with satisfactory creditworthiness 
our investment performance may affect our financial results and ability to conduct business 
our funds are invested by several professional investment advisory management firms under the direction of our management team in accordance with detailed investment guidelines set by us 
although our investment policies stress diversification of risks  conservation of principal and liquidity  our investments are subject to market wide risks and fluctuations  as well as to risks inherent in particular securities 
in particular  the volatility of our claims may force us to liquidate securities  which may cause us to incur capital losses 
if we do not structure our investment portfolio so that it is appropriately matched with our insurance and reinsurance liabilities  we may be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a significant loss to cover the liabilities 
investment losses could significantly decrease our asset base  thereby affecting our ability to conduct business 
for the year ended december   or million of our total revenues  was derived from our invested assets 
this represented of our net income 
we may be adversely affected by interest rate changes 
our operating results are affected  in part  by the performance of our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio contains interest rate sensitive instruments  such as bonds  which may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates could also have an adverse effect on our investment income and results of operations 
for example  if interest rates decline  funds reinvested will earn less than expected 
in addition  our investment portfolio includes mortgage backed securities 
as of december   mortgage backed securities constituted approximately of our invested assets assets under management by third party investment managers 
as with other fixed income investments  the fair market value of these securities fluctuates depending on market and other general economic conditions and the interest rate environment 
changes in interest rates can expose us to prepayment risks on these investments 
in periods of declining interest rates  mortgage prepayments generally increase and mortgage backed securities are prepaid more quickly  requiring us to reinvest the proceeds at the then current market rates 
in periods of increasing interest rates  these investments are exposed to extention risk  which occurs when the holders of underlying mortgages reduce the frequency on which they prepay the outstanding principal before the maturity date and delay any refinancing of the outstanding principal 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
although we take measures to manage the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment  we may not be able to mitigate interest rate sensitivity effectively 
our mitigation efforts include maintaining a high quality portfolio with a relatively short duration to reduce the effect of interest rate changes on book value 
despite our mitigation efforts  a significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our book value 
we may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors  including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses 
we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth and reduce our assets 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are not favorable to us 
in the case of equity financings  dilution to our shareholders could result  and in any case such securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our other securities we may offer 
if we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our operating results may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
for the year ended december   of our gross premiums were written in currencies other than the us dollar 
a portion of our loss reserves and investments are also in non us currencies 
we may  from time to time  experience losses resulting from fluctuations in the values of these non us currencies  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we have no currency hedges in place  other than those related to our investment portfolio  nor are we currently aware of any material exposures to loss payments that will be paid in non us currencies 
we intend to consider the use of hedges when we are advised of known or probable significant losses that will be paid in non us currencies 
however  it is possible that we will not successfully structure those hedges so as to effectively manage these risks 
the regulatory system under which we operate  and potential changes thereto  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
general 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain necessary licenses  permits  authorizations or accreditations in locales where we currently engage in business or in new locales  or may be able to do so only at significant cost 
in addition  we may not be able to comply fully with  or obtain appropriate exemptions from  the wide variety of laws and regulations applicable to insurance or reinsurance companies or holding companies 
failure to comply with or to obtain appropriate authorizations and or exemptions under any applicable laws could result in restrictions on our ability to do business or undertake activities that are regulated in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate and could subject us to fines and other sanctions 
in addition  changes in the laws or regulations to which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business 
axis specialty 
axis specialty is a registered class bermuda insurance and reinsurance company 
among other matters  bermuda statutes and regulations and policies of the bma require axis specialty to maintain minimum levels of statutory capital  surplus and liquidity  meet solvency standards  submit to periodic examinations of its financial condition and restrict payments of dividends and reductions of capital 
these statutes  regulations and policies may  in effect  restrict axis specialty s ability to write insurance and reinsurance policies  to make some investments and to distribute funds to axis capital 
in addition  the offshore insurance and reinsurance regulatory environment has become subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions  including the united states and various states within the united states 
compliance with any new laws or regulations regulating offshore insurers or reinsurers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
axis us subsidiaries 
axis reinsurance is organized in new york and is licensed to write certain lines of insurance and reinsurance in new york and elsewhere throughout the united states 
axis insurance and axis surplus are organized and licensed to write certain lines of insurance in connecticut and illinois  respectively  and are eligible to write certain lines of insurance in some other us jurisdictions on an excess or surplus lines basis axis reinsurance  axis insurance and axis surplus are collectively referred to as the axis us subsidiaries 
the axis us subsidiaries are subject to the laws and regulations of their respective states of domicile and other jurisdictions in which they are licensed or otherwise eligible to engage in business 
these laws and regulations  among other things  subject some affiliate transactions between such entities and other members of our holding company system to regulatory authority and require them to maintain minimum levels of capital  surplus and liquidity and comply with applicable risk based capital requirements 
in addition  they impose restrictions on the payment of dividends and distributions and in some cases require them to file insurance premium rates and policy forms 
these rules and regulations may have the effect of restricting the ability of the axis us subsidiaries to write new business or distribute assets to axis capital 
the purpose of the state insurance laws and regulations is to protect us insureds and us ceding insurance companies  not our shareholders 
in recent years  the us insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny  and some state legislators have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state regulation of insurance and reinsurance companies and holding companies 
moreover  the naic  which is an association of the insurance commissioners of all states and the district of columbia  and state insurance regulators regularly reexamine existing laws and regulations 
changes in these laws and regulations or the interpretation of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
axis specialty europe 
axis specialty europe is a non life insurance company incorporated under the laws of ireland and as such is subject to the regulation and supervision of the irish regulatory authority pursuant to the insurance acts and regulations 
without the consent of the irish regulatory authority  axis specialty europe is not permitted to reduce the level of its capital  may not make any dividend payments  may not make intercompany loans and must maintain a minimum solvency margin 
additionally  axis specialty europe has agreed with the irish regulatory authority to limit the level of reinsurance business that it writes 
these rules and regulations may have the effect of restricting the ability of axis specialty europe to write new business or distribute assets to axis capital 
axis re 
axis re is a reinsurance company incorporated under the laws of ireland 
under irish law  a reinsurance company such as axis re is required to maintain a minimum level of paid up share capital 
as a general matter  axis re is not subject to the same level of regulation in ireland as axis specialty europe 
however  the insurance acts and regulations provide that the irish regulatory authority may create regulations that cause the general insurance laws and regulations in ireland to apply to reinsurance companies that carry on the type of business that axis re carries on 
if any regulations were adopted  such regulations could require axis re to apply to the irish regulatory authority to be authorized to carry on its business  which authorization would likely contain conditions with which axis re would then have to comply  such as in regard to capitalization  maintenance of reserves  reserving policy  investment policy  solvency requirements and the filing of returns 
if such an application for authorization were not successful or if axis re were unable to comply with such conditions as might be attached to such authorization  it would not be lawful for it to continue to carry on its business and it would have to cease operations 
the irish regulatory authority has the power to direct axis re to cease writing business indefinitely or for a specified period for  among other grounds  inadequate capitalization  unsuitable directors and or management or insufficient staff based in ireland 
changes in these laws and regulations or the interpretation of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
in addition  the european commission is currently finalizing a draft directive to establish a harmonized framework for reinsurance supervision in the eu 
once implemented  the directive will permit a reinsurer licensed in one eu member state  which has notified its home state regulator of its intention to do so  to carry on business in any other eu member state without requiring further authorization 
the european commission has indicated in various communications on the subject that the supervisory regime for reinsurers would be largely based on existing rules for direct insurers with some modifications 
once the reinsurance supervision directive is implemented in ireland  axis re will be required to apply to the irish regulatory authority to be authorized to carry on its business or it may be entitled to rely on grandfather provisions which will deem it to be so authorized 
in either event  axis re will be subject to more stringent regulatory requirements such as capitalization  maintenance of reserves  reserving policy  investment policy  solvency requirements and the filing of returns 
if such an application for authorization were not successful or if axis re were unable to comply with the conditions that might be attached to the authorization  it would not be lawful for it to continue to carry on its business and it would have to cease operations 
our inability to obtain the necessary credit could affect our ability to offer reinsurance in certain markets 
axis specialty is not licensed or admitted as an insurer in any jurisdiction other than bermuda 
because many jurisdictions do not permit insurance companies to take credit for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or non admitted insurers on their statutory financial statements unless appropriate security mechanisms are in place  our reinsurance clients typically require axis specialty to post letters of credit or other collateral 
we expect that our credit facility will be used for this purpose 
however  if this facility is not sufficient or if we are unable to renew this facility or are unable to arrange for other types of security on commercially reasonable terms  axis specialty could be limited in its ability to write business for some of our clients 
our ability to pay dividends and to make payments on indebtedness may be constrained by our holding company structure 
axis capital is a holding company and has no direct operations of its own 
axis capital does not expect to have any significant operations or assets other than its ownership of the shares of its operating insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  axis specialty  axis re  axis specialty europe  axis reinsurance  axis insurance and axis surplus collectively  our insurance subsidiaries 
dividends and other permitted distributions from our insurance subsidiaries are expected to be our primary source of funds to meet ongoing cash requirements  including debt service payments and other expenses  and to pay dividends to our shareholders 
our insurance subsidiaries with the exception of axis re are subject to significant regulatory restrictions limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends 
the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our cash requirements at the holding company level could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our ability to pay dividends and make payments on our indebtedness 
our ability to pay dividends and make other payments may be constrained by regulatory and other constraints 
axis capital is subject to bermuda regulatory constraints that will affect its ability to declare and pay dividends on its common shares and make other payments 
under the companies act  axis capital may declare or pay a dividend or make a distribution out of contributed surplus only if it has no reasonable grounds for believing that it is  or would after the payment be  unable to pay its liabilities as they become due or that the realizable value of its assets would thereby be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and issued share capital and share premium accounts 
furthermore  our ability to pay dividends is limited under our credit facility  which provides that we cannot pay cash dividends to our shareholders in excess of million in the aggregate for any fiscal year during the period that any commitments or obligations are outstanding thereunder 
furthermore  in order to reduce its total statutory capital by or more  axis specialty would require the prior approval of the bma 
our founding shareholders and some of our directors may have conflicts of interest with us 
our founding shareholders and some of our directors hold positions  engage in commercial activities and enter into transactions or agreements with us or in competition with us  which may give rise to conflicts of interest 
of our directors  mr 
charles davis is chairman and chief executive officer of mmc capital  inc and a vice chairman of marsh mclennan companies 
inc mr 
thomas forrester is the chief financial officer of the progressive corporation  mr 
donald greene is a director of axa financial  equitable life assurance and associated electric gas insurance services limited  and mr 
frank tasco is a director of travelers property casualty corp 
in addition  we derive a significant portion of our business through insurance and reinsurance relationships and other arrangements in which marsh or its affiliates have acted as a broker or insurance or reinsurance intermediary 
our directors have sponsored  and may in the future sponsor  other entities engaged in or intending to engage in insurance and reinsurance underwriting  some of which may compete with us 
they have also entered into or may in the future enter into  agreements with companies that may compete with us 
we do not have any agreement or understanding with any of these parties regarding the resolution of potential conflicts of interest 
we may not be in a position to influence any party s decision to engage in activities that would give rise to a conflict of interest 
these parties may take actions that are not in our shareholders best interests 
axis capital is a bermuda company and it may be difficult for you to enforce judgments against it or its directors and executive officers 
axis capital is incorporated pursuant to the laws of bermuda and our business is based in bermuda 
in addition  some of our directors and officers reside outside the united states  and all or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of such persons are located in jurisdictions outside the united states 
as such  it may be difficult or impossible to effect service of process within the united states upon those persons or to recover against us or them on judgments of us courts  including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws 
further  no claim may be brought in bermuda against us or our directors and officers for violation of us federal securities laws because these laws have no extraterritorial application under bermuda law and do not have force of law in bermuda 
a bermuda court may  however  impose civil liability  including the possibility of monetary damages  on us or our directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under bermuda law 
we have been advised by conyers dill pearman  our bermuda counsel  that there is doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda would enforce judgments of us courts obtained in actions against us or our directors and officers  as well as the experts named herein  predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws or original actions brought in bermuda against us or such persons predicated solely upon us federal securities laws 
further  we have been advised by conyers dill pearman that there is no treaty in effect between the united states and bermuda providing for the enforcement of judgments of us courts  and there are grounds upon which bermuda courts may not enforce judgments of us courts 
some remedies available under the laws of us jurisdictions  including some remedies available under the us federal securities laws  may not be allowed in bermuda courts as contrary to that jurisdiction s public policy 
our participation in a securities lending program subjects us to risk of default by the borrowers 
we participate in a securities lending program whereby our securities  which are included in investments  are loaned to third parties through a lending agent 
the loaned securities are collateralized by cash  government securities and letters of credit in excess of the fair market value of the securities held by the lending agent 
however  sharp changes in market values of substantial amounts of securities and the failure of the borrowers to honor their commitments  or default by the lending agent in remitting the collateral to us  could have a material adverse effect on our fixed maturity investments or our results of operations 
risks related to our industry we operate in a highly competitive environment 
the insurance and reinsurance industry is highly competitive 
we compete on an international and regional basis with major us  bermuda  european and other international insurers and reinsurers and with lloyds underwriting syndicates  some of which have greater financial  marketing and management resources than we do 
we also compete with new companies that continue to be formed to enter the insurance and reinsurance markets 
in addition  capital market participants have recently created alternative products that are intended to compete with reinsurance products 
increased competition could result in fewer submissions  lower premium rates and less favorable policy terms and conditions  which could have a material adverse effect on our growth and profitability 
the insurance and reinsurance business is historically cyclical  and we expect to experience periods with excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates 
the insurance and reinsurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted favorable premium levels 
an increase in premium levels is often offset by an increasing supply of insurance and reinsurance capacity  either by capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of additional capital by existing insurers or reinsurers  which may cause prices to decrease 
any of these factors could lead to a significant reduction in premium rates  less favorable policy terms and fewer submissions for our underwriting services 
in addition to these considerations  changes in the frequency and severity of losses suffered by insureds and insurers may affect the cycles of the insurance and reinsurance business significantly 
risks related to taxation we may become subject to taxes in bermuda after march   which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and your investment 
the bermuda minister of finance  under the exempted undertakings tax protection act of bermuda  as amended  has given each of axis capital and axis specialty an assurance that if any legislation is enacted in bermuda that would impose tax computed on profits or income  or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  then the imposition of any such tax will not be applicable to axis capital  axis specialty or any of their respective operations  shares  debentures or other obligations until march  given the limited duration of the minister of finance s assurance  we cannot be certain that we will not be subject to any bermuda tax after march  our non us companies may be subject to non us tax that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
axis capital and axis specialty are bermuda companies  axis holdings ireland  axis re and axis specialty europe are irish companies and axis specialty uk limited axis uk and axis specialty uk holdings limited axis uk holdings are uk companies 
we intend to manage our business so that each of these companies will operate in such a manner that none of these companies will be subject to us tax other than us excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premium income attributable to insuring or reinsuring us risks and us withholding tax on some types of us source investment income  because none of these companies should be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the united states 
however  because there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the united states  we cannot be certain that the us internal revenue service irs will not contend successfully that any of axis capital or its non us subsidiaries is are engaged in a trade or business in the united states 
if axis capital or any of its non us subsidiaries were considered to be engaged in a trade or business in the united states  it could be subject to us corporate income and additional branch profits taxes on the portion of its earnings effectively connected to such us business  in which case its results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our non us companies may be subject to non us tax that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we intend to operate in such a manner so that none of our companies  other than axis uk and axis uk holdings  should be resident in the united kingdom for tax purposes and that none of our companies  other than axis ireland holdings and axis specialty europe  should have a permanent establishment in the united kingdom 
accordingly  we expect that none of our companies other than axis uk  axis uk holdings  axis ireland holdings and axis specialty europe should be subject to uk tax 
nevertheless  because neither case law nor uk statutes conclusively define the activities that constitute trading in the united kingdom through a permanent establishment  the uk inland revenue might contend successfully that any of our companies  in addition to axis uk  axis uk holdings  axis ireland holdings and axis specialty europe  is are trading in the united kingdom through a permanent establishment in the united kingdom and therefore subject to uk tax 
if this were the case  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our non irish companies may be subject to irish tax that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we intend to operate in such a manner so that none of our companies  other than axis ireland holdings  axis re and axis specialty europe  should be resident in ireland for tax purposes and that none of our companies  other than axis ireland holdings  axis re and axis specialty europe  should be treated as carrying on a trade through a branch or agency in ireland 
accordingly  we expect that none of our companies other than axis ireland holdings  axis re and axis specialty europe should be subject to irish corporation tax 
nevertheless  since the determination as to whether a company is resident in ireland is a question of fact to be determined based on a number of different factors and since neither case law nor irish legislation conclusively defines the activities that constitute trading in ireland through a branch or agency  the irish revenue commissioners might contend successfully that any of our companies  in addition to axis ireland holdings  axis re and axis specialty europe  is resident in or otherwise trading through a branch or agency in ireland and therefore subject to irish corporation tax 
if this were the case  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if corporate tax rates in ireland increase  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
trading income derived from the insurance and reinsurance businesses carried on in ireland by axis specialty europe and axis re is generally taxed in ireland at a rate of 
over the past number of years  various eu member states have  from time to time  called for harmonization of corporate tax rates within the eu 
ireland  along with other member states  has consistently resisted any movement towards standardized corporate tax rates in the eu 
the government of ireland has also made clear its commitment to retain the rate of corporation tax until at least the year if  however  tax laws in ireland change so as to increase the general corporation tax rate in ireland  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if investments held by axis specialty europe or axis re are determined not to be integral to the insurance and reinsurance businesses carried on by those companies  additional irish tax could be imposed and our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 
based on administrative practice  taxable income derived from investments made by axis specialty europe and axis re is generally taxed in ireland at the rate of on the grounds that such investments either form part of the permanent capital required by regulatory authorities  or are otherwise integral to the insurance and reinsurance businesses carried on by those companies 
axis specialty europe and axis re intend to operate in such a manner so that the level of investments held by such companies does not exceed the amount that is integral to the insurance and reinsurance businesses carried on by axis specialty europe and axis re 
if  however  investment income earned by axis specialty europe or axis re exceeds these thresholds  or if the administrative practice of the irish revenue commissioners changes  irish corporation tax could apply to such investment income at a higher rate currently instead of the general rate  and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the impact of bermuda s letter of commitment to the organization for economic cooperation and development to eliminate harmful tax practices is uncertain and could adversely affect our tax status in bermuda 
the organization for economic cooperation and development the oecd has published reports and launched a global dialogue among member and non member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition 
these measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of tax havens and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world 
in the oecd s report dated april  and updated as of june  bermuda was not listed as an uncooperative tax haven jurisdiction because it had previously committed to eliminate harmful tax practices and to embrace international tax standards for transparency  exchange of information and the elimination of any aspects of the regimes for financial and other services that attract business with no substantial domestic activity 
we are not able to predict what changes will arise from the commitment or whether such changes will subject us to additional taxes
