item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we continue to pursue a strategy of increasing market share in existing and surrounding geographic markets through internal growth and selective acquisition of local and regional companies 
in addition  we will continue to expand into new geographic markets on a selective basis  either through acquisition or by opening new operating centers  when we believe it will enhance our business 
our focus remains primarily on oxygen and other respiratory therapy services  which represent approximately of our revenues 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include accounts of all majority owned subsidiaries 
we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
revenue recognition our revenues are recognized on an accrual basis in the period in which services and related products are provided to customers and are recorded at net realizable amounts estimated to be paid by customers and third party payors 
insurance benefits are assigned to the company and  accordingly  the company bills on behalf of its customers 
the company s billing system contains payor specific price tables that reflect the fee schedule amounts in effect or contractually agreed upon by various government and commercial payors for each item of equipment or supply provided to a customer 
if the payment amount received differs from the net realizable amount  an adjustment is made to the net realizable amount in the period that these payment differences are determined 
we report revenues in our financial statements net of such estimated adjustments 
our revenue recognition policy is consistent with the criteria set forth in staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition sab for determining when revenue is realized or realizable and earned 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the requirements of sab that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate  certain estimates are required to record net revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values at the time products and or services are delivered 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available 
specifically  the complexity of many third party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded 
such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application  claim denial or account review by either the company or a third party intermediary 
included in accounts receivable are earned but unbilled receivables 
unbilled accounts receivable represent charges for equipment and supplies delivered to customers for which invoices have not yet been generated by the billing system 
prior to the delivery of equipment and supplies to customers  we perform certain certification and approval procedures to ensure collection is probable and that unbilled accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable amounts expected to be paid by customers and third party payors 
billing delays  ranging from several days to several weeks  can occur due to delays in obtaining certain required payor specific documentation from internal and external sources  interim transactions occurring between cycle billing dates established for each customer within the billing system and business acquisitions awaiting assignment of new provider enrollment identification numbers 
in the event that the third party does not accept the claim for payment  the customer is ultimately responsible 
we perform analyses to evaluate the net realizable value of accounts receivable 
specifically  we consider historical realization data  accounts receivable aging trends  other operating trends and relevant business conditions 
because of continuing changes in the health care industry and third party reimbursement  it is possible that our estimates could change  which could have an impact on operations and cash flows 
bad debt expense and allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable 
the majority of our accounts receivable are due from medicare  medicaid and private insurance carriers  as well as from customers under co insurance provisions 
third party reimbursement is a complicated process that involves submission of claims to multiple payors  each having its own claims requirements 
in some cases  the ultimate collection of accounts receivable subsequent to the service dates may not be known for several months 
we record bad debt expense based on a percentage of revenue using historical company specific data 
the percentage and amounts used to record bad debt expense and the allowance for doubtful accounts are supported by various methods including current and historical cash collections  bad debt write offs  and aging of accounts receivable 
our proprietary management information systems are utilized to provide this data in order to assess bad debts 
in the event that collection results of existing accounts receivable are not consistent with historical experience  there may be a need to establish an additional allowance for doubtful accounts  which may materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
business acquisition accounting and amortization expense the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  provide guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles for business acquisitions 
we apply the purchase method of accounting for business acquisitions  and use available cash from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and the assumption of certain liabilities as the consideration for business acquisitions 
we allocate the purchase price of our business acquisitions based on the fair market value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets 
the difference between the total cost of the acquisition and the sum of the fair values of acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets less liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
until the end of  goodwill was amortized over a period of years 
the assignment of a year life was based on each acquisition s ability to generate sufficient operating results to support the recorded goodwill balance 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
which required that goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized and instead be tested annually for impairment 
accordingly  no amortization expense related to goodwill was recorded in the financial statements since we assess the impairment of intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include  without limitation  i significant under performance of acquired assets relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  ii significant changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  iii significant negative industry or economic trends  iv increased competitive pressures  v a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and vi technological and regulatory changes 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may be impaired  we evaluate the ability to recover those assets 
if those assets are determined to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
contingencies we are involved in certain claims and legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business 
the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles related to contingencies 
we evaluate and record liabilities for contingencies based on known claims and legal actions when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated 
we have concluded that accrued liabilities related to contingencies are appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
net revenues the following table sets forth for the periods indicated a summary of our net revenues by product category year ended december  in thousands oxygen and other respiratory therapy home medical equipment and other total net revenues for the year ended december  increased by million  an increase of over the increase in net revenues in was comprised of internal growth and acquisition growth 
the medicare reimbursement reductions for respiratory medications that were effective on january  reduced total revenues in the year by million see medicare reimbursement 
net revenues for the year ended december  increased by million  an increase of over the increase in net revenues in was comprised of internal growth and acquisition growth 
the internal growth in net revenues is attributable to underlying growth in the market for our products estimated at annually and increased market share resulting primarily from our sales and marketing efforts that emphasize high quality equipment and customer service 
growth in net revenues from acquisitions is attributable to the effects of acquisitions of local and regional companies and is estimated based on the contribution to net revenues for the twelve months following such acquisitions 
during and  we completed the acquisition of businesses with annual revenues of approximately million and businesses with annual revenues of approximately million  respectively 
the contribution of oxygen and other respiratory therapy products to our net revenues was  and  respectively  for the years ended december   and our strategy is to focus on the provision of oxygen and other respiratory therapy services to patients in the home and to provide home medical equipment and other services where we believe such services will enhance our core respiratory business 
cost of goods and services cost of goods and services includes the cost of equipment excluding depreciation  drugs and supplies sold to patients and certain operating costs related to the company s respiratory pharmacy operations 
these costs include an estimate of customer service  distribution and administrative costs relating to the respiratory pharmacy operations amounting to approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cost of goods and services expressed as a percentage of net revenues was for the year ended december  and for each of the years ended december  and this improvement is attributable primarily to the achievement of more favorable pricing terms with our vendors and growth in our respiratory product lines  which generally carry a higher gross margin percentage than other products and services we provide 
excluding the million reduction to revenues resulting from the medicare price reductions in inhalation drugs in  cost of goods and services expressed as a percentage of net revenues would have declined to operating and other expenses we continue to maintain a cost structure that  with increased net revenues  has permitted us to spread our fixed operating expenses and overhead over a larger base of revenues  resulting in improvement in operating income 
operating expenses expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
this improvement in operating and other expenses was due primarily to our ability to successfully offset the reduction in medicare payment rates for inhalation drugs in with gains in productivity and control over fixed costs during the period 
growth in salary and related expenses and rent expense  which comprised approximately of operating and other expenses in  was held to during fiscal excluding the million reduction in medicare payment rates for inhalation drugs in  operating expenses expressed as a percentage of net revenues would have been 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended december   and  were   and respectively

bad debt expense as a percentage of net revenues was for the years ended december   and we have achieved improved results in accounts receivable collections over the past three years and overall days sales outstanding have decreased to days at december   down from days and days at december  and  respectively 
while we have achieved consistent results in managing bad debt expense over the past three years  continued growth in the pace of our acquisition program may contribute to an increase in our bad debt expense in the future 
the integration of acquired companies into our regional billing and collections offices may temporarily disrupt collections  increasing the amount of accounts receivable written off as uncollectible 
depreciation expense as a percentage of net revenues was for the year ended december  compared with and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
amortization expense in january  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill resulting from business acquisitions completed after june  has not been amortized 
goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions before july  have been amortized through december  goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment 
the provisions of sfas no 
apply to all business combinations completed after june  during  we amortized million of intangible assets compared with million in and million in our net intangible assets were  million as of december  of this total  million consisting of various covenants not to compete is being amortized over periods of one to five years 
operating income as shown in the table below  operating income for the years ended december  and increased by million and million  respectively  over the prior year 
the increases in operating income are attributed primarily to the factors identified above  which include continued growth in our net revenues through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions  favorable product acquisition costs resulting from negotiations with our vendors  gains in labor productivity which limited the growth in our salary and related expenses and control over operating costs 
year ended december  in thousands operating income percentage of net revenues interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense in was impacted by the issuance in june  of million of convertible senior debentures due and the pay down of million of senior secured notes in september  interest expense in was impacted by the full year effect of the convertible debentures and the pay down of million of senior secured notes in september see liquidity and capital resources

acquisitions in  the company acquired  in unrelated acquisitions  certain operating assets of local and regional companies resulting in the addition of new operating centers 
additionally  the company purchased the remaining equity interests in two companies in which we had previously acquired partial ownership 
the aggregate cost of these acquisitions was million and was allocated to acquired assets as follows million to current assets  million to property and equipment  million to separately identifiable intangible assets  and million to goodwill 
in  the company acquired  in unrelated acquisitions  certain operating assets of local and regional companies and interests in three joint ventures  resulting in the addition of new operating centers 
the aggregate cost of these acquisitions was million and was allocated to acquired assets as follows million to current assets  million to property and equipment  million to separately identifiable intangible assets  million to other assets and million to goodwill 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity have been internally generated funds from operations  borrowings under credit facilities and proceeds from equity and debt transactions 
we have used these funds to meet our capital requirements  which consist primarily of operational needs  capital expenditures  acquisitions and debt service 
at december   our working capital was million  as compared to million  at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  a significant portion of our assets consists of accounts receivable from third party payors that are responsible for payment for the equipment and services we provide 
contributing to the increase in net cash from operating activities was a decrease in net accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso resulting from improved collection performance 
our dso was days as of december  and days as of december  net cash used in investing and financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
activity in the year ended december  included our investment of million in business acquisitions  investment in capital equipment of million  proceeds of million from our issuance of debt and million related to our payment of debt 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents and million available under our revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement  dated april   makes available to us up to million over a five year period  subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the agreement 
we believe that internally generated funds  together with funds that may be borrowed under our revolving credit agreement  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital requirements and financial obligations 
we believe that our credit standing provides us with adequate access to financial markets 
on december   the board of directors authorized a plan to repurchase up to million of the company s common stock 
purchases will be made through open market or privately negotiated transactions  subject to market conditions and trading restrictions 
as of december   no purchases had been made under this plan and the total common stock held in treasury  at cost  was million 
on june   we completed the sale of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior debentures due the debentures in a private placement 
the debentures are convertible into shares of our common stock based on a conversion rate of shares for each  principal amount of debentures 
this is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
on june we sold an additional million principal amount of debentures pursuant to the exercise in full of an over allotment option granted to the initial purchasers of the debentures 
the debentures are convertible into common stock in any calendar quarter if  among other circumstances  the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least trading days during the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of our previous calendar quarter is greater than or equal to of the applicable conversion price per share per share of our common stock on such last trading day 
interest on the debentures is payable at the rate of per annum on june and december of each year 
the debentures are senior unsecured obligations and will mature on june  the debentures are redeemable by us on or after june  and may be put to us for repurchase on june     or our future liquidity will continue to be dependent upon our operating cash flow and management of accounts receivable 
we anticipate that funds generated from operations  together with our current cash on hand and funds available under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to finance our working capital requirements  fund anticipated acquisitions and capital expenditures  and meet our contractual obligations for at least the next months 
in addition to our contractual obligations described below  we plan to invest in excess of million in acquisitions and repurchase up to million of our common stock during off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
future minimum obligations in the normal course of business  we enter into obligations and commitments that require future contractual payments 
the commitments primarily result from repayment obligations for borrowings under our senior secured notes  revolving bank credit facility and debentures  as well as contractual lease payments for facility  vehicle  and equipment leases and deferred acquisition obligations

all forward looking statements included in this document are based upon information available to lincare as of the date hereof and lincare assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
these statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause lincare s actual results  levels of activity  performance or achievements to be materially different from any results  levels of activity  performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward looking statements 
in some cases  forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties contain terminology such as may  will  should  could  expects  intends  plans  anticipates  believes  estimates  predicts  potential  or continue or variations of these terms or other comparable terminology 
key factors that have an impact on lincare s ability to attain these estimates include potential reductions in reimbursement rates by government and third party payors  changes in reimbursement policies  the demand for lincare s products and services  the availability of appropriate acquisition candidates and lincare s ability to successfully complete and integrate acquisitions  efficient operations of lincare s existing and future operating facilities  regulation and or regulatory action affecting lincare or its business  economic and competitive conditions  access to borrowed and or equity capital on favorable terms and other risks described below 
in developing our forward looking statements  we have made certain assumptions relating to reimbursement rates and policies  internal growth and acquisitions and the outcome of various legal and regulatory proceedings 
if the assumptions we use differ materially from what actually occurs  then actual results could vary significantly from the performance projected in the forward looking statements 
we are under no duty to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this report 
certain risk factors relating to the company s business we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks and others are discussed elsewhere in this report 
these and other risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
a majority of our customers have primary health coverage under medicare part b  and recently enacted and future changes in the reimbursement rates or payment methodologies under the medicare program could materially and adversely affect our business 
as a provider of home oxygen and other respiratory therapy services for the home health care market  we have historically depended heavily on medicare reimbursement as a result of the high proportion of elderly persons suffering from respiratory disease 
medicare part b  the supplementary medical insurance program  provides coverage to eligible beneficiaries for dme  such as oxygen equipment  respiratory assistance devices  continuous positive airway pressure devices  nebulizers and associated respiratory medications  hospital beds and wheelchairs for the home setting 
approximately percent of our customers have primary coverage under medicare part b 
there are increasing pressures on medicare to control health care costs and to reduce or limit reimbursement rates for home medical equipment and services 
medicare reimbursement is subject to statutory and regulatory changes  retroactive rate adjustments  administrative and executive orders and governmental funding restrictions  all of which could materially decrease payments to us for the services and equipment we provide 
as discussed herein see medicare reimbursement  the president signed mma into law on december  this legislation  among other things  provides expanded medicare prescription drug coverage  modifies payments to medicare providers and institutes administrative reforms intended to improve medicare program operations 
mma includes sweeping changes that will impact a broad spectrum of health care industry participants  including physicians  pharmacies  manufacturers and pharmacy benefit managers  as well as other medicare suppliers and providers  including lincare 
the mma legislation contains provisions that directly impact reimbursement for the primary respiratory and other dme products provided by lincare 
among other things  mma significantly reduces reimbursement for inhalation drug therapies in and even more so in  reduces payment amounts for five categories of dme  including oxygen  beginning in  freezes payment amounts for other covered dme items from to  establishes a competitive acquisition program for dme beginning in  and implements quality standards and accreditation requirements for dme suppliers 
the mma provisions  if fully implemented  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
see medicare reimbursement for a full discussion of the mma provisions 
a significant percentage of our business is derived from the sale and rental of medicare covered dme items  including oxygen  and recent legislation reduces payment amounts for five categories of dme  including oxygen  beginning in and imposes a payment freeze for other dme from to mma contains provisions that would reduce payment amounts  beginning in  for oxygen equipment  standard wheelchairs including standard power wheelchairs  nebulizers  diabetic supplies consisting of lancets and testing strips  hospital beds and air mattresses to the median prices paid under the federal employee health plan fehp 
reductions in payment rates for established by cms for the non oxygen items subject to the fehp provisions range between and and are expected to reduce average reimbursement for these types of items provided by the company by approximately 
the non oxygen dme items subject to the medicare price cuts accounted for approximately of total revenues for the company in mma also freezes payment amounts for other covered dme items from to on september   the oig released a report entitled  medicare payment rates for home oxygen equipment  which will serve as the basis for establishing medicare payment rates for oxygen in in its report  the oig determined that medicare allowances are approximately higher for stationary oxygen systems and approximately higher for portable oxygen systems when compared with surveyed fehp plans  representing a weighted average difference of approximately 
the cms administrator  in a letter to the oig dated august   agreed with the oig s recommendation to use the pricing information contained in the oig report to reduce the rates medicare pays for home oxygen equipment in cms also concurred with the oig s recommendation to consider alternative methods for determining future medicare oxygen payment rates  such as competitive bidding  contracts with local or national providers  and capped rental arrangements 
on february   dms published notice cms n announcing a delay in the implementation of the medicare oxygen payment rates 
the notice states that cms was informed by the oig that it would need to collect additional information before the fehp median prices for oxygen are finalized 
until such prices are established  medicare claims for oxygen equipment furnished on or after january  will be paid based on the monthly payment amounts 
cms is expected to calculate and implement the lower payment amounts upon receipt of the additional information from the oig 
we can not determine the outcome of the medicare oxygen payment rates nor the date on which the new payment amounts will become effective 
oxygen and oxygen equipment reimbursed by medicare accounted for approximately of total revenues for the company in such payment reductions  when implemented in  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results 
a significant percentage of our business is derived from the sale of medicare covered respiratory medications  and recent legislation imposes significant reductions in medicare reimbursement for such inhalation drugs 
historically  prescription drug coverage under medicare has been limited to drugs furnished incident to a physician s services and certain self administered drugs  including inhalation drug therapies 
prior to mma  medicare reimbursement for covered part b drugs  including inhalation drugs that we provide  had been limited to percent of the published average wholesale price awp for the drug 
mma establishes new payment limits and procedures for drugs reimbursed under medicare part b 
payments for inhalation drugs furnished during declined to percent of the awp in effect as of april   a reduction of approximately 
this reduction in medicare payment rates for inhalation drugs reduced our revenues and operating income by approximately million in beginning in  inhalation drugs furnished to medicare beneficiaries would be reimbursed at percent of the volume weighted average selling price asp of the drug  as determined from data to be provided by drug manufacturers under a specific formula described in mma 
on november   cms issued its final rule  cms fc  which establishes a monthly dispensing fee of per customer for inhalation drug therapy in addition to the asp based payment rate for the drugs dispensed 
the rule also establishes an alternative dispensing fee of per customer when dispensed in day increments 
payment rates for inhalation drugs will be updated quarterly based on the manufacturer asp calculated for the most recent calendar quarter for which data are available 
manufacturer asp submissions are due to cms not later than days after the last day of each calendar quarter 
inhalation drug payment rates in the first quarter of will therefore be based on asp data from the third quarter of asp payment rates in effect for the first quarter of have been published by cms and indicate substantially reduced payment rates for inhalation drugs 
for example  the payment rates for the two most prevalent inhalation drugs  albuterol sulfate and ipratropium bromide  would be reduced from and per milligram to and  respectively  representing reductions of to 
the combination of the new asp payment rates for inhalation drugs established for the first quarter of and the monthly dispensing fee of is expected to reduce total reimbursement for inhalation drug therapies provided by the company by approximately 
medicare reimbursed inhalation drug therapies provided by the company in accounted for approximately of total revenues 
while lincare continues to evaluate the impact of the final rule on its business  we expect to be able to continue to provide inhalation drugs to medicare beneficiaries in the final rule states that cms intends to revisit the payment amount for the dispensing fee during and proceed through notice and comment rulemaking in order to establish an appropriate dispensing fee for lincare can not determine the outcome of any future rulemaking by cms nor the impact that such rulemaking might have on our ability to continue to provide inhalation drugs beyond such payment adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results 
recent regulatory changes subject the medicare reimbursement rates for our equipment and services to potential discretionary adjustment by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms  which could reduce our revenues  net income and cash flows 
in february  a final rule governing cms inherent reasonableness  or ir  authority became effective 
the ir rule establishes a process for adjusting fee schedule amounts for medicare part b services when existing payment amounts are determined to be either grossly excessive or deficient 
the rule describes the factors that cms or its contractors will consider in making such determinations and the procedures that will be followed in establishing new payment amounts 
to date  no payment adjustments have occurred or been proposed as a result of the ir rule 
the effectiveness of the ir rule itself does not trigger payment adjustments for any items or services 
nevertheless  the ir rule puts in place a process that could eventually have a significant impact on medicare payments for our equipment and services 
we can not predict whether or when cms will exercise its ir authority with respect to our equipment and services 
such payment adjustments  if implemented  could reduce our revenues  net income and cash flows 
recent legislation establishing a competitive bidding process under medicare could reduce our revenues  net income and cash flows 
mma instructs the secretary to establish and implement programs under which competitive acquisition areas are established throughout the united states for contract award purposes for the furnishing of competitively priced items of dme  including oxygen equipment 
the program would be implemented in phases such that competition under the program occurs in of the largest msas in  of the largest msas in  and additional areas after items selected for competitive acquisition may be phased in first among the highest cost and highest volume items and services or those items and services that the secretary determines have the largest savings potential 
in carrying out such programs  the secretary may exempt rural areas and areas with low population density within urban areas that are not competitive  unless there is a significant national market through mail order for a particular item or service 
for each competitive acquisition area  the secretary would conduct a competition under which providers would submit bids to supply certain covered items of dme 
successful bidders would be expected to meet certain program quality standards in order to be awarded a contract and only successful bidders could supply the covered items to medicare beneficiaries in the acquisition area 
the applicable contract award prices are expected to be less than would be paid under current medicare fee schedules and contracts would be re bid at least every three years 
the secretary will be required to award contracts to multiple entities submitting bids in each area for an item or service  but would have the authority to limit the number of contractors in a competitive acquisition area to the number needed to meet projected demand 
the secretary may use competitive bid pricing information to adjust the payment amount otherwise in effect for an area that is not a competitive acquisition area 
we can not predict the outcome of the competitive acquisition program or the medicare payment rates that will be in effect in and beyond for the items subject to competitive bidding 
competitive bidding  when implemented  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results 
future reductions in reimbursement rates under medicaid could reduce our revenues  net income and cash flows 
due to budgetary shortfalls  many states are considering  or have enacted  cuts to their medicaid programs  including funding for our equipment and services 
these cuts have included  or may include  elimination or reduction of coverage for some or all of our equipment and services  amounts eligible for payment under co insurance arrangements  or payment rates for covered items 
approximately of our customers are eligible for primary medicaid benefits  and state medicaid programs fund  approximately of our payments from primary and secondary insurance benefits 
continued state budgetary pressures could lead to further reductions in funding for the reimbursement for our equipment and services which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results 
future reductions in reimbursement rates from private payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
payors such as private insurance companies and employers are under pressure to increase profitability and reduce costs 
in response  certain payors are limiting coverage or reducing reimbursement rates for the equipment and services we provide 
approximately of our customers and approximately of our primary and secondary payments are derived from private payors 
continued financial pressures on these entities could lead to further reimbursement reductions for our equipment and services that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
we depend upon reimbursement from third party payors for a significant majority of our revenues  and if we fail to manage the complex and lengthy reimbursement process  our business and operating results could suffer 
we derive a significant majority of our revenues from reimbursement by third party payors 
we accept assignment of insurance benefits from customers and  in most instances  invoice and collect payments directly from medicare  medicaid and private insurance carriers  as well as from customers under co insurance provisions 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from medicare  from private insurance carriers  from medicaid and the balance directly from individual customers and commercial entities 
our financial condition and results of operations may be affected by the reimbursement process  which in the health care industry is complex and can involve lengthy delays between the time that services are rendered and the time that the reimbursement amounts are settled 
depending on the payor  we may be required to obtain certain payor specific documentation from physicians and other health care providers before submitting claims for reimbursement 
certain payors have filing deadlines and they will not pay claims submitted after such time 
we can not assure you that we will be able to continue to effectively manage the reimbursement process and collect payments for our equipment and services promptly 
we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation  and if we fail to comply with applicable regulations  we could suffer severe criminal or civil sanctions or be required to make significant changes to our operations that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the federal government and all states in which we operate regulate many aspects of our business 
in particular  our operating centers are subject to federal laws that regulate the repackaging of drugs including oxygen and interstate motor carrier transportation 
our operations also are subject to state laws governing  among other things  pharmacies  nursing services  distribution of medical equipment and certain types of home health activities 
certain of our employees are subject to state laws and regulations governing the ethics and professional practices of respiratory therapy  pharmacy and nursing 
as a health care supplier  we are subject to extensive government regulation  including numerous laws directed at preventing fraud and abuse and laws regulating reimbursement under various government programs 
the marketing  billing  documenting and other practices of health care companies are all subject to government scrutiny 
to ensure compliance with medicare and other regulations  regional carriers often conduct audits and request customer records and other documents to support our claims for payment 
similarly  government agencies periodically open investigations and obtain information from health care providers pursuant to the legal process 
violations of federal and state regulations can result in severe criminal  civil and administrative penalties and sanctions  including disqualification from medicare and other reimbursement programs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
health care is an area of rapid regulatory change 
changes in the law and new interpretations of existing laws may affect permissible activities  the costs associated with doing business  and reimbursement amounts paid by federal  state and other third party payors 
we can not predict the future of federal  state and local regulation or legislation  including medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations  or possible changes in national health care policies 
future legislation and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business 
compliance with new regulations under the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of and related rules  or hipaa  relating to the transmission and privacy of health information could impose additional significant costs on our operations 
numerous federal and state laws and regulations  including hipaa  govern the collection  dissemination  use and confidentiality of patient identifiable health information 
hipaa requires us to comply with standards for the use and disclosure of health information within our company and with third parties 
hipaa also includes standards for common health care electronic transactions and code sets  such as claims information  plan eligibility  payment information and the use of electronic signatures  and privacy and electronic security of individually identifiable health information 
each set of hipaa regulations has a specified compliance date and requires health care providers  including us  in addition to health plans and clearinghouses  to develop and maintain policies and procedures with respect to protected health information that is used or disclosed 
the hipaa regulations mandate that standardized transaction and code sets be developed and used for electronic billing purposes by all payors in the united states  including both government and private health plans 
while the medicare program has historically used a uniform set of transaction codes for electronic claim submission and payment  certain billing codes have varied among the different state medicaid programs and certain health plans 
it is currently unknown whether every existing billing code used by medicare  medicaid and private health plans for products provided in the home care setting will have a corresponding code in the final hipaa transaction sets 
the absence of certain standardized codes for our equipment and services or the inability of certain payors to accept such electronic codes may preclude us from submitting electronic claims for payment to those payors 
such an outcome would require the submission of paper claims  which could ultimately result in delays and difficulties in collecting these claims  and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results 
if we do not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to patient health information  we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions 
new health information standards  whether implemented pursuant to hipaa or otherwise  could have a significant effect on the manner in which we handle health care related data and communicate with payors  and the cost of complying with these standards could be significant 
we may undertake acquisitions that could subject us to unanticipated liabilities and that could fail to achieve expected benefits 
our strategy is to increase our market share through internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
consideration for the acquisitions has generally consisted of cash  unsecured non interest bearing obligations and the assumption of certain liabilities 
the implementation of an acquisition strategy entails certain risks  including inaccurate assessment of disclosed liabilities  the existence of undisclosed liabilities  entry into markets in which we may have limited or no experience  diversion of management s attention and human resources from our underlying business  difficulties in integrating the operations of an acquired business or in realizing anticipated efficiencies and cost savings  failure to retain key management or operating personnel of the acquired business  and an increase in indebtedness and a limitation in the ability to access additional capital on favorable terms 
the successful integration of an acquired business may be dependent on the size of the acquired business  condition of the customer billing records  and complexity of system conversions and execution of the integration plan by local management 
if we do not successfully integrate the acquired business  the acquisition could fail to achieve its expected revenue contribution or there could be delays in the billing and collection of claims for services rendered to customers  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results 
we face intense national  regional and local competition and if we are unable to compete successfully  we will lose revenues and our business will suffer 
the home respiratory market is a fragmented and highly competitive industry 
we compete against other national providers and  by our estimate  more than  local and regional providers 
home respiratory companies compete primarily on the basis of service rather than price since reimbursement levels are established by medicare and medicaid or by the individual determinations of private health plans 
our ability to compete successfully and to increase our referrals of new customers are highly dependent upon our reputation within each local health care market for providing responsive  professional and high quality service and achieving strong customer satisfaction 
given the relatively low barriers to entry in the home respiratory market  we expect that the industry will become increasingly competitive in the future 
increased competition in the future could limit our ability to attract and retain key operating personnel and achieve continued growth in our core business 
increases in our costs could erode our profit margins and substantially reduce our net income and cash flows 
cost containment in the health care industry  fueled  in part  by federal and state government budgetary shortfalls  is likely to result in constant or decreasing reimbursement amounts for our equipment and services 
as a result  we must control our operating cost levels  particularly labor and related costs  which account for approximately of our operating costs and expenditures 
we compete with other health care providers to attract and retain qualified or skilled personnel 
we also compete with various industries for lower wage administrative and service employees 
since reimbursement rates are established by fee schedules mandated by medicare  medicaid and private payors  we are not able to offset the effects of general inflation in labor and related cost components  if any  through increases in prices for our equipment and services 
consequently  such cost increases could erode our profit margins and reduce our net income

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the fair value of our revolving credit agreement and senior secured notes are subject to change as a result of changes in market prices or interest rates 
we estimate potential changes in the fair value of interest rate sensitive financial instruments based on a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates 
our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions 
the quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account anticipated operating and financial transactions 
the following table sets forth the estimated fair value of our long term obligations and our estimate of the impact from a percent decrease in interest rates on the fair value of our long term obligations and the associated change in annual interest expense
