these have an impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
all numbers except per share data and ratios are presented in thousands 
summary results  goals  and objectives at the beginning of  management set three primary goals intended to facilitate the company s transition to a growth company 
first  to improve net interest margin  second  continue to increase earnings and transform the company by investing in higher growth opportunities  and third  to continue to improve credit quality 
the first goal was achieved in the first quarter by restructuring the balance sheet 
a summary of that restructure follows 
the key steps of the balance sheet restructuring included the company prepaid  in long term fhlb advances with an average yield of that had constrained earnings and masked the significant financial progress the company has made in recent years 
the remaining average life of the debt was about years and maturities ranged from september to october integra incurred a charge of   after tax to extinguish the debt 
the company also reduced its balance sheet and funded a portion of the fhlb debt extinquishment by reducing its investment portfolio by approximately  this action improved integra s interest rate risk profile by reducing the amount of assets susceptible to prepayments and in a rising rate environment reduces extension risk 
integra recognized a gain of   after tax on the sale of these securities 
the average yield on the securities sold was and their duration was approximately years 
the company further improved its interest rate risk profile and improved its liquidity position by arranging  of new fixed rate borrowings with final maturities ranging from to years  having an average life of approximately years and an average cost of 
additionally  the company issued  of subordinated debt and paid off the outstanding balance on its line of credit 
the company used the surplus cash proceeds from these transactions to reduce short term borrowings 
the balance sheet restructuring improved the company s margin and earnings  and reduced its interest rate risk profile 
additional developments during the first quarter  integra received an investment grade rating of baa from moody s investor service for the long term deposits of its principal subsidiary  integra bank na the bank 
management believes this public rating bolsters the company s liquidity with enhanced access to the capital markets 
as a result of the balance sheet restructuring  the second goal of increasing earnings was achieved 
by the fourth quarter  net income compared to the same period for was up and the net interest margin had improved by basis points 
the company also experienced low cost deposit growth and implemented expense control measures 
in order to improve capital ratios and retain capital  the company changed its dividend philosophy  which reduced the quarterly common stock dividend from cents per share to cents per share beginning with the july dividend payment 
as a result  the company moved to a target long term dividend payout ratio of to 
this contrasts with a dividend payout ratio that was over in the third goal was improving credit quality 
net chargeoffs were basis points of total average loans and non performing assets declined  or from the ratio of allowance for loan losses to non performing assets decreased to for priorities the company has set three priorities for these goals are grow revenue improve efficiencies service quality and employee development executing loan growth initiatives in consumer  small business  and commercial real estate will help to increase revenue in this will be complemented by heightening low cost deposit initiatives to retail and cash management customers 
the company has initiated a high performance checking program that began in late january 
this program is a direct mailing program designed to focus on core checking account acquisition through product simplification and marketing expertise 
the second priority is to improve efficiencies through increased revenue growth 
the company also plans to exercise disciplined expense management  which will include continuing to execute on strategies to divest or improve under performing areas and products 
these strategies also encompass our plans to balance the mix of our branch markets closer to an equal number of community and metro markets  which will be accomplished by branch build outs  divestitures  and acquisitions in growing metro markets 
the third priority is to continue high service quality and develop employees 
the company will continue its i care service initiatives which has improved the level and awareness of service to customers 
the company will continue to invest in employee training to develop  challenge  motivate and reward its greatest asset  its employees 
the company believes all these priorities will accelerate loan growth  increase core deposits  and enhance shareholder value 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgements are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgements 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgements and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
the company considers its critical accounting policies to include the following allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for losses  and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the provision for loan losses is determined based on management s assessment of several factors actual loss experience  changes in composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of specific borrowers and collateral  current economic conditions  trends in past due and non accrual loan balances  and the results of recent regulatory examinations 
see section labeled credit management contained in management s discussion and analysis 
loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable the company will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the market value of the collateral  less estimated cost to liquidate 
in measuring the market value of the collateral  management uses assumptions and methodologies consistent with those that would be utilized by unrelated third parties 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  in economic conditions  in historical loss experience and in the conditions of the various markets in which the collateral may be liquidated may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
estimation of market value the estimation of market value is significant to several of the company s assets  including loans held for sale  investment securities available for sale  mortgage servicing rights  other real estate owned  as well as market values associated with derivative financial instruments and goodwill and other intangibles 
these are all recorded at either market value or the lower of cost or market value 
market values are determined based on third party sources  when available 
furthermore  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require disclosure of the market value of financial instruments as a part of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
market values may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates and the shape of yield curves 
market values for securities available for sale are based on quoted market prices 
if a quoted market price is not available  market values are estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities 
the market values for loans held for sale are based upon quoted market values while the market values of mortgage servicing rights are based on discounted cash flow analysis utilizing dealer consensus prepayment speeds and market discount rates 
the market values of other real estate owned are typically determined based on appraisals by third parties  less estimated costs to sell 
the market values of derivative financial instruments are estimated based on current market quotes 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
the company assesses goodwill for impairment no less than annually by applying a fair value based test using net present value of estimated net cash flows 
impairment exists when the net book value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value and the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
if the company s calculation of the fair value decreased by goodwill could be impaired 
other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with an asset or liability 
mortgage servicing rights msrs represent an estimate of the present value of future cash servicing income  net of estimated costs  the company expects to receive on loans sold with servicing retained 
msrs are capitalized as separate assets when loans are sold and servicing is retained 
the carrying value of msrs is amortized in proportion to and over the period of  net servicing income and this amortization is recorded as a reduction to income 
the carrying value of the msrs asset is periodically reviewed for impairment based on the fair value of the msrs  using groupings of the underlying loans by interest rates and loan types 
any impairment of a grouping would need to be reported as a valuation allowance 
a primary factor influencing the fair value is the estimated life of the underlying loans serviced 
the estimated life of the loans serviced is significantly influenced by market interest rates 
during a period of declining interest rates  the fair value of the msrs should decline due to expected prepayments within the portfolio 
alternatively  during a period of rising interest rates the fair value of msrs should increase as prepayments on the underlying loans would be expected to decline 
if the company experienced a increase in prepayments  the tranches of the asset could be impaired 
on an ongoing basis  management considers all relevant factors to estimate the fair value of the msrs to be recorded when the loans are initially sold with servicing retained

net interest income was  or  higher in than in the increase was primarily due to the balance sheet restructuring in the first quarter of and pricing discipline through both in deposits and loans 
net interest income was  or  lower in than in the decrease was primarily due to an asset sensitive balance sheet for most of in a lower rate environment 
pricing discipline on both loans and deposits was stressed and monitored in the securities portfolio was restructured and and year fixed rate high premium mortgaged backed securities were replaced primarily with two to three year duration low premium or discount collateralized mortgage obligations with significant prepayment protection of the cashflow and to year hybrid adjustable rate mortgages arms 
earning assets averaged  in compared to  in the decrease was due to mainly to the balance sheet restructuring 
average interest bearing liabilities were  and  in and  respectively 
the decrease in liabilities was due primarily from the reduction in fhlb borrowings during the balance sheet restructuring 
the net interest margin for the twelve months ended december  was compared to for the same period one year prior 
the basis points increase in margin was mainly the result of the balance sheet restructuring and monitoring and control of deposit pricing 
although rates increased in  a soft loan market resulted in tighter loan pricing which offset the increase 
the net interest margin decreased from in to in earning assets averaged  in compared to  in average interest bearing liabilities were  and  in and  respectively 
during and  the federal reserve lowered the targeted federal funds interest rates and basis points  respectively 
the significant drop in rates over and  approximately basis points  increased prepayments in both the mortgage backed investment securities and fixed rate loan portfolios  including a significant impact on residential mortgages 
when prepaid  these funds were generally reinvested at lower rates 
another result of the balance sheet restructuring was the decrease in average earning assets  which decreased  to  in securities  which were sold during the restructuring  were the main component of the  decrease from the impact of this repositioning was a basis point increase in security income to in average loans held for sale decreased  as a result of slowing mortgage loan refinancing demand which was primarily due to higher mortgage loan rates 
average loans also decreased  in along with a lower loan demand in the midwest markets  the company in april sold its credit card portfolio  which decreased loans by  the mix of earning assets shows average loans to average earning assets increased from in and in to in average earning assets increased  during to  the company made a decision to hold fewer short term investments in  finding other alternatives to provide liquidity 
average federal funds sold and other short term investments decreased  compared to average loans held for sale decreased  in due primarily to the loan sale conducted during during average loans increased  or 
average investment securities increased  or  in partially offsetting the reduction in short term investments 
the yield on securities declined from in to in security income decreased in as a result of a basis point decline in security yields partially offset by the increase in average balances 
average valuable core deposits which include demand deposits both interest bearing and non interest bearing  money market and savings  increased  in this was offset by a decrease of  in certificates of deposits and other time deposits 
these lower interest valuable core deposits and the pricing discipline the company maintained throughout lowered the interest costs on deposits basis points in a rising rate environment 
primarily as a result of the balance sheet restructuring  average short term borrowings decreased  or  and average long term borrowings decreased  or  in average short term borrowings cost rose basis points mainly as a result of the federal funds rate increasing basis points throughout the year 
this increase was offset by the decrease in the cost of long term borrowings 
the cost of these funds decreased basis points  again primarily as the result of the restructuring 
overall  average deposit balances rose by  or  in this reflects a  increase in valuable core deposits  partially offset by a  reduction in time deposits 
during the current low interest rate environment  customer preferences have shifted to shorter term  liquid deposit products and to deposit alternatives  including annuities 
during  average short term borrowings increased  and average long term borrowings decreased  the decrease in long term borrowings was primarily due to the prepayment of long term  higher rate debt 
non interest income non interest income totaled  for the twelve months ended december  compared to  for and  for adjusted non interest income totaled  in   in and  in adjusted non interest income continues to be an increasingly significant portion of revenue for the company and has grown to represent of net federal tax equivalent revenues in as compared to in and in the table below illustrates several non interest income items incurred outside the traditional core bank operations and reconciles non interest income and adjusted non interest income 
securities gains are excluded in adjusted non interest income since the gains were used to offset the impact of the debt prepayment expense incurred in each year 
management believes excluding these items presents a clearer picture of core operating non interest income 
reconciliation table adjusted non interest income non interest income as reported    less gain on sale of credit cards  less gain on branch sale  less loss on fixed asset disposition less securities gains    adjusted non interest income    service charges on deposit accounts increased  or  in growth in these fees resulted from an increase in fee charges in the first quarter and greater product and service usage 
service charge income totaled  in   in  and  in other service charges and fees increased from  in to  in card related fees totaled  in compared to  in and  in due to increased sales efforts of debit cards and the increasing preference of these cards over checks 
as a result of the national mastercard visa settlement with wal mart stores inc  debit card interchange fees decreased in the second half of the company is making an effort to increase the usage of debit cards  which through normal growth has decreased the impact in and with increased usage will further improve these fees 
mortgage banking income in was compared to  in due to the high demand for new and refinanced residential mortgages in the company sold the majority of its current year s fixed rate mortgage loan production to generate fee income and reduce interest rate exposure 
the company continues to service most of these loans 
at december   the company was servicing  of sold residential mortgage loans compared to  at december  gain on mortgage loans sold decreased  in compared to in gains on sale of mortgages increased from there was a slower mortgage origination environment in due to a higher interest rate environment as compared to the company utilizes multiple distribution channels in servicing customers in our area

the gain realized on the sale was  after tax 
integra entered into an arrangement with the purchaser of the portfolio to offer integra s customers a wider variety of credit card products 
management anticipates that the transaction will be approximately income neutral to positive in future periods with the reduction in spread income  and fees more than offset by fee sharing arrangements with the purchaser of the portfolio  as well as reduced loan loss provision and processing expenses 
the company announced in december its intention to sell three branches in southern illinois 
this sale should be completed in the second quarter of the deposits for these three branches were approximately  at december   however  certain deposits may be excluded from the sale 
other non interest income totaled  in compared to  in and  in during the company recorded income of nearly from the loan to a foreign subsidiary of a domestic company 
this gain was the result of the fluctuations in the eurodollar exchange rate 
this is the company s only foreign currency exposure 
there was a corresponding expense recorded in other expense which netted to a gain of included in  was from the expiration of covered call option contracts and from net securities trading account income 
these revenue sources were related to a discontinued leverage program 
management has no plans to revive these programs 
securities transactions resulted in gains of  in   in  and  in the gains in were  in large part  a result of the balance sheet restructuring 
the gains in were used  in part  to offset the costs associated with prepaying  in long term fhlb borrowings and the redemption of  of trust preferred securities 
non interest expense non interest expense for totaled  an increase of  or compared to the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to  of debt prepayment fees paid during the balance sheet restructure  which culminated in the first quarter of adjusted non interest expense was  for  or  higher than the table below illustrates several expenses incurred outside the traditional core bank operations and reconciles non interest expense and adjusted non interest expense 
management believes excluding these items presents a clearer picture of core operating expense 
reconciliation table adjusted non interest expense non interest expense as reported    less debt prepayment expenses    less loan held for sale expense  less low income housing project losses   less accelerated trust preferred amortization  adjusted non interest expense    salaries and employee benefits accounted for of adjusted non interest expense in compared to in and in salaries and employee benefits totaled  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
salaries  incentives and commissions increased  or while insurance and other benefits decreased in salaries and benefits rose  compared to the increase was attributable to three items salaries increased approximately  or  medical insurance increased  and commissions and incentives increased  part of the increase in salary expense in is attributable to in sourcing the company s internal audit and loan review functions 
the company has reviewed the costs of medical insurance and in offered an alternative choice to employees that incents employees to manage their health care consumption and could help control the increase in these expenses in the future 
the alternative plan has higher deductibles but provides a savings account for the employee which  if not used in the current year  can be utilized to offset health care deductibles in future periods 
the commissions and incentives increases in and were mainly due to the increase in performance based awards tied to loan originations and sales of fee based services and deposit products

this represents a  or increase  in net income from the same quarter result of per diluted share 
the stronger performance was driven  in part  by an basis point improvement in the net interest margin to on a fully tax equivalent basis  lower non performing assets and solid credit trends 
comparisons to the fourth quarter of are impacted by integra s balance sheet restructuring which occurred late in the first quarter of interest income in the fourth quarter of  on a tax equivalent basis  benefited from a collection of interest and margin related fees on a loan that had previously been on nonaccrual status and contributed approximately basis points to the net interest margin in the fourth quarter of return on assets and return on equity were and  respectively  for the fourth quarter of compared to and for the fourth quarter of financial condition total assets at december   were  compared to  at december  short term investments federal funds sold and other short term investments totaled at december  compared to  one year prior

the balance sheet restructuring included a reduction in the security portfolio of approximately  the portfolio has continued to shift toward investments in year low premium or discount collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and to year hybrid arms  and out of high premium and year fixed rate passthrough mortgage backed securities 
inherent in mortgage backed securities is prepayment risk  which occurs when borrowers prepay their obligations due to market fluctuations and rates 
prepayment rates generally can be expected to increase during periods of lower interest rates as underlying mortgages are refinanced at lower rates  which occurred in mortgage backed securities and cmos represented of the investment portfolio at december  as compared to and at december  and  respectively 
management repositioned a portion of the portfolio late in and early in order to reduce the exposure to accelerating prepayments and unanticipated premium write downs going forward 
the company s present investment strategy focuses on shorter duration securities with more predictable cash flows in a variety of interest rate scenarios

the principal effect of this change was to reduce the number of loans reported prior to as real estate or real estate mortgage loans 
the company determined that it was not practical to apply the new methodology to earlier years 
as a result  information for years and are shown as previously reported and are not comparable to the information for   and comparable amounts that would be included in the real estate loans line for   and would be   and  respectively 
different types of loans are subject to varying levels of risk 
management mitigates this risk through portfolio diversification as well as geographic diversification 
the company concentrates its lending activity in the geographic market areas that it serves  primarily indiana  illinois  kentucky and ohio 
the loan portfolio is also diversified by type of loan and industry 
the company lends to customers in various industries including real estate  agricultural  health and other related services  and manufacturing 
there is no concentration of loans in any single industry exceeding of the portfolio nor does the portfolio contain any loans to finance speculative transactions or loans to foreign entities 
the company has one loan of approximately  to a foreign subsidiary of a domestic company 
this loan is guaranteed by the domestic parent which hedges the currency through a eurodollar agent

nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest recognition has been suspended because of doubts as to the borrower s ability to repay principal or interest according to the terms of the contract 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status after becoming days past due if the ultimate collectability of the loan is in question 
loans which are current  but as to which serious doubt exists about repayment ability  may also be placed on nonaccrual status 
restructured loans are loans for which the terms have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of principal or interest because of the borrower s financial position 
loans days or more past due are loans that are continuing to accrue interest  but which are contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments 
other real estate owned represents properties obtained for debts previously contracted 
management is not aware of any loans which have not been disclosed as non performing assets that represent or result from unfavorable trends or uncertainties which management reasonably believes will materially adversely affect future operating results  liquidity or capital resources  or represent material credits as to which management has serious doubt as to the ability of such borrower to comply with loan repayment terms

the company actively manages non performing loans in order to maintain this level 
the change in the components of non performing loans was due to one large loan which was included in days past due category for during this loan was placed in non accrual status 
non performing assets decreased  mainly due to the settlement of the above mentioned municipal security 
the interest recognized on nonaccrual loans was approximately  and  in  and  respectively 
the amount of interest that would have been earned had these nonaccrual loans remained in accruing status was  and  for and  respectively 
the company monitors watch list assets 
for the most part  assets are designated as watch list to ensure more frequent monitoring 
the assets are reviewed to insure proper earning status and security perfection 
if it is determined that there is serious doubt as to performance in accordance with the original terms of the contract then the loan is placed on nonaccrual 
these loans are reviewed on an ongoing basis 
credit management the company s credit management procedures include board oversight of the lending function by the board s credit and risk management committee  which meets at least quarterly 
the committee monitors credit quality through its review of information such as delinquencies  non performing loans and assets  problem and watch list loans and charge offs 
the lending policies address risks associated with each type of lending  including collateralization  loan to value ratios  loan concentrations  insider lending and other pertinent matters and are regularly reviewed to ensure that they remain appropriate for the current lending environment 
in addition  a sample of loans is reviewed by an independent loan review department or outside independent third party  as well as by a compliance department and regulatory agencies 
consumer  mortgage and small business loans are centrally underwritten and approved while commercial loans are approved through a combination of low individual lending authorities  independent senior credit officers and an executive loan committee 
the executive loan committee approves or ratifies all loans in excess of  the allowance for loan losses is that amount which  in management s opinion  is adequate to absorb probable inherent loan losses as determined by management s ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio 
the evaluation by management is based upon consideration of various factors including growth of the portfolio  an analysis of individual credits  adverse situations that could affect a borrower s ability to repay  prior and current loss experience  the results of recent regulatory examinations and economic conditions 
loans that are deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance  while recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance 
the provision for loan losses is the amount charged to operations to provide assurance that the allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb probable losses 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on ongoing quarterly assessments of the probable losses inherent in the credit portfolios 
the methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance establishes both an allocated and unallocated component 
the allocated component of the allowance for commercial loans is based on a review of specific loans as well as delinquency  classification levels and historic charge offs for pools of non reviewed loans 
for consumer loans  the allocated component is based on loan payment status and historical loss rates 
a review of selected loans based on risk rating and size is conducted to identify loans with heightened risk or probable losses 
the primary responsibility for this review rests with management assigned accountability for the credit relationship 
this review is supplemented by the loan review area  which provides information assisting in the timely identification of problems and potential problems and in deciding whether the credit represents a probable loss or risk which should be recognized 
where appropriate  an allocation is made to the allowance for individual loans based on management s estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral  other sources of cash flow and legal options available to the company 
included in the review of individual loans are those that are impaired as provided in sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable the company will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms 
the allowance established for impaired loans is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the market value of the collateral  less estimated cost to liquidate 
homogeneous pools of loans  such as consumer installment and residential real estate loans  are not individually reviewed 
an allowance is established for each pool of loans based upon historical loss ratios  based on the net charge off history by loan category 
in addition  the allowance reflects other risks affecting the loan portfolio  such as economic conditions in the company s geographic areas  specific industry financial conditions and other factors 
the unallocated portion of the allowance covers general economic uncertainties as well as the imprecision inherent in any loan and lease loss forecasting methodology 
it will vary over time depending on economic  industry  organization and portfolio conditions 
the factors used to evaluate homogenous loans in accordance with the sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies are reviewed at least quarterly and are updated as conditions warrant  resulting in improved allocation of specific reserves 
the provision for loan losses is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for loan losses to an amount that is adequate to absorb estimated loan losses as determined by management s periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio 
this evaluation by management is based upon consideration of actual loss experience  changes in composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of specific borrowers and collateral  current economic conditions  trends in past due and non accrual loan balances and the results of recent regulatory examinations 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed on a quarterly basis and presented to the audit committee of the board of directors for approval 
the accounting policies related to the allowance for loan losses are significant policies that involve the use of estimates and a high degree of subjectivity 
management believes it has developed appropriate policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that reflect the assessment of credit risk after careful consideration of known relevant facts 
in developing this assessment  management must rely on estimates and exercise judgement regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown such as economic factors  developments affecting companies in specific industries or issues with respect to single borrowers 
depending on changes in circumstances  future assessments of credit risk may yield different results  which may require an increase or decrease in the allowance for loan losses 
during the third quarter of  management refined the process that it uses to perform this analysis 
these included expanded data analysis  improved back testing and continued refinements to documentation surrounding the adequacy of the allowance 
additionally  the controls utilized for data entry  testing  review and approval were enhanced 
management believes these changes provide more reliable measures of the probability of default and risk of loss for the company s categories of loans with similar risk characteristics 
the principal change involved the ability to analyze loss data over a longer period of time 
this allows us to improve the measure of inherent loss over a complete economic cycle and reduces the impact for qualitative adjustments 
these changes do not impact losses estimated in accordance with financial accounting standard  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan and overall did not have a material effect on the balance of the allowance for loan losses 
the company continues to enhance its loan portfolio monitoring system to enhance its risk management capabilities 
during the year the company implemented the markov migration model for it s commercial portfolio 
among the most significant enhancements were expanded score band performance  loan to value analysis  and vintage analysis 
the provision for loan losses totaled  in  a decrease of  from the  provided in the lower provision reflected the change in the loan origination mix and the improved quality of the portfolio

management continuously reviews the company s liability composition 
any modifications could adversely affect the profitability and capital levels of the company over the near term  but would be undertaken if management determines that restructuring the balance sheet will improve the company s interest rate risk and liquidity risk profile on a longer term basis 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations the company has certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts 
the company s long term borrowings represent fhlb advances with various terms and rates collateralized primarily by first mortgage loans and certain specifically assigned securities  securities sold under repurchase agreements  notes payable secured by equipment  subordinated debt and trust preferred securities 
the company is also committed under various operating leases for premises and equipment 
in the normal course of business  there are various outstanding commitments and contingencies  including letters of credit and standby letters of credit  that are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event the nonperformance by the other party to the commitment is limited to the contractual amount 
many commitments expire without being used 
therefore  the amounts stated below do not necessarily represent future cash commitments 
the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for other on balance sheet instruments

the company and the banking industry are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can elicit certain mandatory actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s financial statements 
capital adequacy in the banking industry is evaluated primarily by the use of ratios that measure capital against assets and certain off balance sheet items 
certain ratios weight these assets based on risk characteristics according to regulatory accounting practices 
at december   the company and integra bank exceeded the regulatory minimums and integra bank met the regulatory definition of well capitalized 
see additional discussion in note capital trust preferred securities held by the company s wholly owned subsidiaries currently qualify as tier capital for the company under federal reserve board guidelines

liquidity liquidity of a banking institution reflects the ability to provide funds to meet loan requests  to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and other borrowings  and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities 
funding loan requests  providing for deposit out flows  and managing interest rate fluctuations require monitoring and continuous analysis in order to match maturities of specific categories of short term and long term loans and investments with specific types of deposits and borrowings 
bank liquidity is normally considered in terms of the nature of mix of the banking institution s sources and uses of funds 
for integra bank na  the primary sources of short term asset liquidity have been federal funds sold  commercial paper  interest bearing deposits with other financial institutions  and securities available for sale 
in addition to these sources  short term asset liquidity is provided by scheduled principal paydowns and maturing loans and securities 
the balance between these sources and needs to fund loan demand and deposit withdrawals is monitored under the company s asset liability management program 
when these sources are not adequate  the company may use federal fund purchases  brokered deposits  repurchase agreements  sale of investment securities or utilize its borrowing capacity with fhlb indianapolis  as alternative sources of liquidity 
additionally  the company s underwriting standards for its mortgage loan portfolio comply with standards established by government housing agencies  as a result  a portion of the mortgage loan portfolio could be sold to provide additional liquidity

accounting changes for information regarding accounting standards issued which will be adopted in future periods  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk is the exposure of earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
fluctuations in rates affect earnings by changing net interest income and other interest sensitive income and expense levels 
interest rate changes affect the market value of capital by altering the underlying value of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
the interest rate risk management program for the company is comprised of several components 
the components include board of directors oversight  senior management oversight  risk limits and control  risk identification and measurement  risk monitoring and reporting and independent review 
it is the objective of the company s interest rate risk management processes to manage the impact of interest rate volatility on bank earnings and capital 
at the company  interest rate risk is managed through the corporate asset and liability committee corporate alco with oversight through the alco and finance committee of the board of directors board alco 
the board alco meets at least twice a quarter and is responsible for the establishment of policies  risk limits and authorization levels 
the corporate alco meets at least monthly and is responsible for implementing policies and procedures  overseeing the entire interest rate risk management process and establishing internal controls 
interest rate risk is measured and monitored on a proactive basis by utilizing a simulation model 
the company uses the following key methodologies to measure interest rate risk 
earnings at risk ear 
ear is considered management s best source of managing short term interest rate risk one year time frame 
this measure reflects the dollar amount of net interest income that will be impacted by changes in interest rates 
the company uses a simulation model to run immediate and parallel changes in interest rates from a base scenario using implied forward rates 
the standard simulation analysis assesses the impact on net interest income over a month horizon by shocking the implied forward yield curve up and down   and basis points 
additional yield curve scenarios are tested from time to time to assess the risk to changes in the slope of the yield curve and changes in basis relationships 
these interest rate scenarios are executed against a balance sheet utilizing projected growth and composition 
additional simulations are run from time to time to assess the risk to earnings and liquidity from balance sheet growth occurring faster or slower than anticipated as well as the impact of faster or slower prepayments in the loan and securities portfolio 
this simulation model projects the net interest income forecasted under each scenario and calculates the percentage change from the base interest rate scenario 
the board alco has approved policy limits for changes in one year ear from the base interest rate scenario of minus percent to a basis point rate shock in either direction 
at december   the company would experience a negative change in ear  if interest rates moved downward basis points 
if interest rates moved upward basis points  the company would experience a negative change in net interest income 
both simulation results are within the policy limits established by the board alco 
during  ear in the up basis point scenario was favorably impacted by an increase in floating rate loans and by the reduction in both investment securities and short term borrowings which were part of the balance sheet restructuring that occurred in march estimated change in ear from the base interest rate scenario basis points basis points december  december  economic value of equity eve 
management considers eve to be its best analytical tool for measuring long term interest rate risk 
this measure reflects the dollar amount of net equity that will be impacted by changes in interest rates 
the company uses a simulation model to evaluate the impact of immediate and parallel changes in interest rates from a base scenario using implied forward rates 
the standard simulation analysis assesses the impact on eve by shocking the implied forward yield curve up and down   and basis points 
this simulation model projects the estimated economic value of assets and liabilities under each scenario 
the difference between the economic value of total assets and the economic value of total liabilities is referred to as the economic value of equity 
the simulation model calculates the percentage change from the base interest rate scenario 
for eve calculations  future balance sheet composition is not a factor 
the board alco has approved policy limits for changes in eve 
the variance limit for eve is measured in an environment when the base interest rate scenario is shocked up or down basis points within a range of plus or minus 
at december   the company would experience a positive change in eve if interest rates moved downward basis points 
if interest rates moved upward basis points  the company would experience a negative change in eve 
both of these measures are within board approved policy limits 
the reduction in the size of the investment securities portfolio  which was part of the balance sheet restructure in march  accounts for the majority of the improvement in the eve risk measure from the previous year in the up basis point scenario 
estimated change in eve from the base interest rate scenario basis points basis points december  december  the assumptions in any of these simulation runs are inherently uncertain 
any simulation cannot precisely estimate net interest income or economic value of the assets and liabilities or predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income or on the economic value of the assets and liabilities 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes  the difference between actual experience and the characteristics assumed  as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies
