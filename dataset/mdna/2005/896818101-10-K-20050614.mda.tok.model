item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere herein 
overview we are a major supplier to the aerospace industry and have two operating segments i triumph aerospace systems group  which designs  engineers and manufactures a wide range of components  assemblies and systems for aircraft manufacturers  and ii triumph aftermarket services group  which serves aircraft fleets  notably commercial airlines  the us military and cargo carriers  through the repair and overhaul of aircraft components and accessories 
financial highlights for fiscal fiscal net sales increased to million  cash flow from operations increased to million  year end backlog increased to million  and completed divestiture of non core assets  generating proceeds of million 
for fiscal  we reported income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted common share  as compared to million  or per diluted common share  for fiscal net income for fiscal was million  or per diluted common share  versus million  or per diluted common share  for the prior year 
for fiscal  net sales from continuing operations increased to million from million for fiscal  representing a year over year increase 
cash flow from operating activities for fiscal was million  compared to million realized in fiscal  a increase 
our working capital needs are generally funded through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit arrangements 
for the fiscal year ended march   we generated approximately million of cash flows from operating activities  generated approximately million in investing activities and used approximately million in financing activities 
we have recently received several important new contract awards including a contract between our subsidiary  triumph gear systems macomb  and general electric to provide the inlet gearbox  as well as specific related spare parts for the cfm engine program for the life of the program 
the boeing and airbus a  a  a  a and a aircraft are the primary platforms for the cfm engine 
the agreement has an estimated value of up to million based upon current market forecasts 
a five year contract between our subsidiary  triumph precision castings co  and the us army tacom to provide first stage rotor blades for the agt gas turbine propulsion engine used on the ma abrams tank 
the contract has an estimated value of million with production scheduled to start in november a long term contract with lockheed martin corporation to supply major structural components on the sniper and arrowhead advanced targeting programs 
the agreement between lockheed martin and our subsidiary  la gauge  has an estimated value in excess of million over the next four years 
a contract for the design and manufacturing of the floor panel system for the a freighter aircraft 
this contract includes conceptual and concurrent detailed design  qualification testing  parts manufacturing and post production support for the life of the a freighter 
this award represents a potential total program value in excess of million for our subsidiary  triumph composite systems  inc  over the life of the af program 
outlook sales for fiscal are expected to grow to a range of to million and earnings per share for fiscal of to  with quarterly results sequentially improving during the year 
our fiscal outlook is based on the following market assumptions the commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive 
market liberalization in europe and asia has continued to enable low cost airlines to gain market share 
these airlines have increased the downward pressure on airfares 
this results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products 
major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins 
conversely  we also expect the recent gain in the aircraft seat miles experienced by the airlines to continue  positively affecting our business 
the continued growth in air freight also will benefit us and the industry 
world wide air travel experienced a strong rebound in this rebound is notable in that it represents a recovery from the levels of calendar year which were depressed by the sars outbreak in asia  and represents a traffic level that exceeds the previous record which was set in it has taken the industry years to exceed that level  indicating the difficulties faced by the world s airlines as they have dealt with the effects of recession  terrorism and disease 
this traffic volume has been driven by strong world wide economic growth which stimulates demand  and declining real airline yields which makes air travel more affordable to more people 
the downturn in the commercial air transport market segment  the lingering impact of the terrorist attacks  increases in fuel costs and heightened competition from low cost carriers have adversely affected the financial condition of some commercial airlines 
recently  several airlines have declared bankruptcy or indicated that bankruptcy may be imminent  however  a large portion of our aftermarket sales are to air cargo carriers  which are financially stable 
the major trends that shape the current military defense environment include significant but relatively flat us government defense and space budgets  rapid expansion of information and communication technologies  and the need for low cost  assured access to space 
the us department of defense dod authorization was approved in the fourth quarter of at a total level of billion excluding supplementals 
although under pressure  the dod budget remains strong and focused on transformation 
with this continued pressure on the budget the dod will continue to focus on affordability strategies emphasizing network centric operations  joint interoperability  long range strike  unmanned air combat and reconnaissance vehicles  precision guided weapons and continued privatization of logistics and support activities as a means to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs 
deliveries of airbus and boeing large commercial aircraft are expected to be significantly higher in calendar  compared to calendar airbus and boeing reported actual deliveries for calendar of aircraft 
their deliveries for calendar are expected to increase by approximately  to about aircraft 
capacity in the global airline system  as measured by available seat miles asms  is expected to continue to grow 
we expect global asm growth of about in calendar  compared to calendar our sales to airlines for large commercial and regional aircraft aftermarket parts and service are expected to grow approximately proportionately with increases in capacity 
total regional and business at capacity aircraft production is expected to be relatively flat in fiscal  compared to fiscal  as deliveries of business jets are expected to increase  offsetting the expected decrease in regional aircraft deliveries 
in the regional aircraft market we expect to see growth in the seat segment offset by continued weakness in the seat products 
military sales oem and aftermarket are expected to increase roughly in line with global military budgets  which are expected to grow in the low single digit range for fiscal  compared to fiscal results of operations realignment we have reorganized our operations and organizational structure to realign the way we manage our business 
the new structure separates our business of manufacturing proprietary and build to print products for the global aerospace oem market and classifies these operations as the aerospace systems segment 
at the same time  we have reorganized the aftermarket services segment to focus on the maintenance  repair and overhaul services on a global basis to both commercial and military markets on components and accessories manufactured by third parties 
under this new organizational structure  we had three reportable segments aerospace systems  aftermarket services and other 
our aerospace systems segment consists of operating locations  the aftermarket services segment consists of operating locations  and the other segment consisted of operating locations prior to the elimination of this segment at year end due to the shutdown  sale or transfer of assets to our other operating segments 
accordingly  the company has two reportable segments 
exit from igt market and sale of discontinued operations during the second quarter of fiscal  we incurred fixed asset impairment charges of million related to igt tooling and leasehold improvements in a facility that we determined we would no longer use as part of our restructuring activities 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we incurred fixed asset and intangible impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
also in the third quarter  we sold our igt repair division and our plasma spray coating businesses 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of million and sold our wisconsin manufacturing division and other non core assets 
after taking into account the asset impairments  the net proceeds from the sale of these businesses and assets approximated net book value 
the proceeds from the sales resulted in cash receipts of million and a promissory note in the amount of million to be paid over one year 
in addition to the asset impairments  we incurred million of cash expenses related to the realignment 
during fiscal  we sold substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of our metals businesses metals for cash proceeds of million and recorded a million loss on the sale of these businesses 
the businesses that comprise the discontinued operations manufacture  machine  process and distribute metal products to customers in the computer  container and office furniture industries  primarily within north america  in addition to providing structural steel erection services 
we have historically stated that we would retain metals due to its positive cash flows which were used to fund the growth of our aviation businesses 
however  in march we decided to focus on our core capabilities in aviation and sell metals 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  year ended march  dollars in thousands net sales   segment operating income   corporate general and administrative expenses   total operating income   interest expense and other   income tax expense   income from continuing operations   loss from discontinued operations   net income   changes in net sales and segment operating income are discussed within the business segment performance section below 
corporate general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily due to increased audit and other expenses to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of interest expense and other increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the prior year period 
this increase was primarily due to increased interest rates partially offset by lower average borrowings outstanding 
the effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal the fiscal effective tax rate of varies from the federal statutory tax rate of primarily due to benefits realized from the research and development tax credit of approximately million and the extraterritorial income eti exclusion of approximately million 
loss from discontinued operations before income taxes was million for fiscal compared with a loss from discontinued operations before income taxes of million for fiscal  resulting in a change of million  due to a loss on the sale of the assets of million partially offset by operating profits primarily resulting from higher selling prices due to the increased global demand for steel 
the benefit for income taxes was million in fiscal compared to a benefit of million in the prior year period 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  year ended march  dollars in thousands net sales   segment operating income   corporate general and administrative expenses   total operating income   interest expense and other   income tax expense   income from continuing operations   loss from discontinued operations  net income   changes in net sales and segment operating income are discussed within the business segment performance section below 
corporate general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily due to increased audit  staffing and regulatory costs 
interest expense and other decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the prior year period 
this decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates  partially offset by increased borrowing related to businesses acquired and our capital expenditure program 
the effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal the fiscal effective tax rate of varies from the federal statutory tax rate of primarily due to benefits realized from the research and development tax credit of approximately million and the eti exclusion of approximately million 
the rate also reflects approximately million of favorable tax adjustments resulting from the completion of income tax audits through fiscal  partially offset by state income taxes and nondeductible accruals 
in march  we designated metals to be discontinued operations and we attempted to sell these businesses in fiscal the loss from discontinued operations before income taxes was million for fiscal compared with a loss from discontinued operations before income taxes of million for fiscal the benefit for income taxes was million in fiscal compared to a benefit of million in the prior year period 
business segment performance we have reorganized our operations and organizational structure to realign the way we manage our business 
the new structure separates our business of manufacturing proprietary and build to print products for the global aerospace oem market and classifies these operations as the aerospace systems segment 
at the same time  we have reorganized the aftermarket services segment to focus on the maintenance  repair and overhaul services on a global basis to both commercial and military markets on components and accessories manufactured by third parties 
under this new organizational structure  we have three reportable segments aerospace systems  aftermarket services and other 
our aerospace systems segment consists of operating locations  the aftermarket services segment consists of operating locations  and the other segment consisted of operating locations prior to the elimination of this segment at year end due to the shutdown  sale or transfer of assets to our other operating segments 
the aerospace systems segment consists of our operations which manufacture products that primarily service the aerospace oem market 
the segment s operations design and engineer mechanical and electromechanical controls  such as hydraulic systems  main engine gearbox assemblies  accumulators and mechanical control cables 
the segment s revenues are also derived from stretch forming  die forming  milling  bonding  machining  welding and assembly and fabrication of various structural components used in aircraft wings  fuselages and other significant assemblies 
further  the segment s operations also manufacture metallic and composite bonded honeycomb assemblies for floor panels  fuselage  wings and flight control surface parts 
these products are sold to various aerospace oems on a global basis 
the aftermarket services segment provides maintenance  repair and overhaul services to both commercial and military markets on components and accessories manufactured by third parties 
maintenance  repair and overhaul revenues are derived from services on auxiliary power units  aircraft accessories  including constant speed drives  cabin compressors  starters and generators  and pneumatic drive units 
in addition  the segment s operations repair and overhaul thrust reversers  nacelle components and other aerostructures 
the segment s operations also perform repair and overhaul services  and supply spare parts  for various types of cockpit instruments and gauges for a broad range of commercial airlines on a worldwide basis 
the other segment s operations and assets  primarily comprised of the igt businesses  manufactured or repaired and overhauled igt components  primarily for oems and power generation equipment operators  and applied high temperature coatings for both internal and external customers 
these operations and assets have been sold  liquidated  or re deployed to the other two remaining segments  and are no longer a reportable segment after march  business segment performance fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  year ended march  of total sales change dollars in thousands net sales aerospace systems   aftermarket services   other   elimination of inter segment sales   total net sales   of segment sales year ended march  change dollars in thousands segment operating income aerospace systems   aftermarket services   other   total segment operating income   aerospace systems the aerospace systems segment net sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was due to the sales increase of million associated with the acquisitions of parker hannifin s united aircraft products division  renamed triumph thermal systems  in may and rolls royce gear systems  inc  renamed triumph gear systems  inc  from rolls royce north america venture i inc 
in january collectively  the acquisitions completed in fiscal  and an increase in same store sales of million due to the increased manufacturing of large structural precision components and assemblies for the aerospace and ground defense markets and cabin windows for the general aviation and corporate jet market as a result of customer demand related to increased production of both commercial and military aircraft 
aerospace systems segment operating income increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal operating income increased due to the acquisitions as discussed above  which showed a year over year increase of approximately million 
partially offsetting the increase in segment operating income were the following increases in healthcare costs  research and development and depreciation and amortization expenses  and legal expenses associated with the trade secret litigation totaling approximately million 
aftermarket services the aftermarket services segment net sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to the following growth in global commercial air traffic and us military maintenance demand resulted in increased demand for the repair and overhaul of auxiliary power units as well as the brokering of similar units  and the inclusion of the casting facility net sales in this segment  since we made a decision to exit the igt market 
the casting business has transitioned its target market away from igt products and shifted its focus to the production of aerospace products in the current year 
accordingly  the current year period results of the casting business are included in the aftermarket services segment 
the prior year period results of the casting business are included in the other segment 
these actions are collectively referred to in this discussion as the casting business realignment 
aftermarket services segment operating income decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was due to the million operating loss of the casting business in the current year period as a result of the casting business realignment  and an increase in staffing  healthcare and other costs associated with the increase in business activity 
other segment the other segment net sales decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this was a result of our decision to exit the igt business and stop taking sales orders relative to this particular market 
the other segment incurred an operating loss of million for fiscal compared to an operating loss of million for fiscal this improvement was due to the effect of the casting business realignment  which included a million operating loss of the casting business in the prior year period 
significant charges and costs of million associated with the restructuring steps taken to exit the igt business incurred in the current year 
business segment performance fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  year ended march  of total sales change dollars in thousands net sales aerospace systems   aftermarket services   other   elimination of inter segment sales   total net sales   of segment sales year ended march  change dollars in thousands segment operating income aerospace systems   aftermarket services   other   total segment operating income   aerospace systems the aerospace systems segment net sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the positive impact was primarily due to the sales increase of million associated with the acquisition of the boeing company s spokane fabrication operation the acquisition in january and the acquisitions  partially offset by decreases in net sales resulting from decreases in commercial airframe build rates 
the aerospace systems segment operating income decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal operating income decreased primarily due to decreases in net sales resulting from decreases in commercial airframe build rates  competitive market pressures and under absorption of plant capacity  a million gain recognized during fiscal related to modifications of employee benefit plans compared to a million gain recognized during fiscal in fiscal  we reduced our share of retiree medical benefits resulting in a million gain  which was recognized in the second quarter of fiscal the fiscal gain included million due to reductions in retiree medical benefits offset by a million curtailment loss resulting from freezing a defined benefit pension plan  and increases in research and development of million over the prior year period 
partially offsetting the decrease was approximately million of year over year increase in operating results from the acquisitions and acquisition 
aftermarket services the aftermarket services segment net sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to the august acquisition of furst aircraft  inc with a year over year net sales increase of million 
partially offsetting this increase was reduced maintenance and repair and overhaul activity as compared to the prior year period 
the aftermarket services segment operating income decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was due to reduced maintenance and repair and overhaul activity as compared to the prior year period  and inventory write downs of million 
other segment the other segment net sales decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decline was primarily due to an overall decrease in demand from oems and power generation equipment operators in the igt market from the levels caused by the artificial energy shortage in late fiscal the lower level of perceived future energy requirements caused a significant number of order cancellations for new power generating equipment  and  as a result  current market shipments remained at approximately of fiscal levels with inventories at some equipment manufacturers exceeding two years of demand 
the other segment incurred an operating loss of million for fiscal compared to operating income of million for fiscal this decline was primarily due to decrease in sales to both oems and power generation equipment operators in the igt market  and charges recorded during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal associated with million of inventory write downs and decisions made regarding the recoverability of customer accounts receivable of million and the continuing value of certain fixed assets of million associated with the igt operations  partially offset by a reduction in employment costs which resulted from a reduction in headcount 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital needs are generally funded through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit arrangements 
for the year ended march   we generated approximately million of cash flows from operating activities  generated approximately million in investing activities and used approximately million in financing activities 
we completed our previously announced plan to exit the igt business  which had previously been part of the other segment 
all of the operations at the phoenix manufacturing division of our subsidiary  triumph engineered solutions  inc  ceased as of march  in connection with the shutdown  we sold for cash certain of the assets at net book value 
the remaining assets and backlog associated with the commercial aerospace business  which were included in the other segment  have been transferred to our other facilities 
in addition  assets of the igt repair division were sold at net book value 
also  the assets of the wisconsin manufacturing division of triumph engineered solutions were sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal proceeds from the sale of the assets resulted in cash receipts of million and a note in the amount of million 
we had anticipated that up to million of costs would be incurred in fiscal as the realignment was completed 
we incurred approximately million of charges  which is included in operating costs and expenses  of which approximately million were cash expenses related to the realignment 
included in the million is approximately million and million related to non cash impairments of fixed assets and intangible assets  respectively 
during fiscal  we sold substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of metals for cash proceeds of million and recorded a million loss on the sale of these businesses 
the businesses that comprise the discontinued operations manufactured  machined  processed and distributed metal products to customers in the computer  container and office furniture industries  primarily within north america  in addition to providing structural steel erection services 
we had historically stated that we would retain metals due to its positive cash flows which were used to fund the growth of our aviation businesses 
however  we decided to focus on our core capabilities in aviation and sell metals 
capital expenditures were approximately million for the fiscal year ended march  primarily for manufacturing machinery and equipment 
we funded these expenditures through borrowings under our credit facility as described below 
we expect capital expenditures to be up to million for our fiscal year ending march  the expenditures are expected to be used mainly to expand capacity or replace old equipment at several facilities 
during fiscal  we prepaid million of principal of the senior notes as a result of the cash proceeds from the sales of triwestern metals and kilroy structural steel  and the igt businesses sold as prescribed by the amended note purchase agreement 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in may  an additional million of principal was prepaid due to additional cash proceeds received from the above sales 
in november  as a result of our decision to exit the igt business and the effect of the restructuring costs and operating losses incurred in the other segment  we amended our credit facility to amend certain terms and covenants 
our credit facility bears interest at either the london interbank offering rate libor plus between and  the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus if greater or an overnight interest rate at our option 
the variation in the interest rate is based upon our ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
in addition  we are required to pay a commitment fee of between and on the unused portion of our credit facility 
as of march   million was available under our credit facility 
on march   an aggregate amount of approximately million was outstanding under the credit facility  million of which was accruing interest at libor plus applicable basis points totaling per annum  and million of which was accruing interest at the overnight interest rate of per annum 
amounts repaid under our credit facility may be reborrowed 
in conjunction with amending our credit facility in november  we also amended certain terms and covenants of our two classes of senior notes  for the same reasons described above 
effective march   we further amended certain terms and covenants of our two classes of senior notes 
during fiscal  we finalized the purchase price of our subsidiary  triumph gear systems  inc  and paid an additional million as a result of settling on the values on the closing balance sheet 
also during fiscal  we paid million related to a contract signed with general electric to provide the inlet gearbox as well as specific related spare parts for the cfm engine program for the life of the program 
we expect to pay approximately million in additional consideration through april related to the contract 
the cash paid was funded by borrowings under our credit facility 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on december   we announced a program to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock 
from the inception of the program through march   we have repurchased a total of  shares for a total purchase price of million 
the proceeds from the sale of assets have been offered  in accordance with the senior notes purchase agreement  and accepted by the noteholders of the senior notes 
some or all of the proceeds  which were used to repay the borrowings under the revolving credit facility  will need to be reborrowed to satisfy the obligation to the noteholders who elected to receive a prepayment 
our expected future cash flows for the next five years for long term debt  leases and other obligations are as follows contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years long term debt obligations     capital lease obligations operating lease obligations     purchase obligations    other long term obligations    total      included in our balance sheet at march  includes interest component 
we believe that cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for our current operations 
however  we have a stated policy to grow through acquisition and are continuously evaluating various acquisition opportunities 
as a result  we currently are pursuing the potential purchase of a number of candidates 
in the event that more than one of these transactions are successfully consummated  our credit facility might be fully utilized and additional funding sources may be needed 
there can be no assurance that such funding sources will be available to us on terms favorable to us  if at all 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in determining the appropriate allowance  we consider a combination of factors  such as industry trends  our customers financial strength and credit standing  and payment and default history 
the calculation of the required allowance requires a judgment as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to actual amounts 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the average cost or specific identification methods 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated  inventory adjustments may be required 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to actual amounts 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with invoice terms  generally when completed products or repaired parts are shipped 
our policy with respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that the customer may not return products or be given allowances  except at our option 
accruals for sales returns  other allowances  and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time of shipment based upon past experience 
if actual future sales returns  allowances and warranty amounts are higher than past experience  additional amounts may be required 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to actual amounts 
goodwill and intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  sfas no 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  rather  they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
additionally  intangible assets with finite lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas no 
requires a two step impairment test for goodwill 
the first step is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit s assets to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the second step is required to be completed  which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability  with the excess being implied goodwill 
an impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill 
the determination of the fair value of our reporting units is based  among other things  on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued 
we are required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and record any resulting impairment losses annually 
changes in market conditions  among other factors  may have an impact on these estimates 
we completed our required annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that there was no impairment 
for our impairment test  we use market multiples from an external source for an average of stock price to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for certain companies in the aerospace and defense markets in computing the fair value of each reporting unit 
in the event that market multiples for stock price to ebitda in the aerospace and defense markets decrease  or the expected ebitda for our reporting units decreases  a goodwill impairment charge may be required  which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
no impairment charges have been incurred since the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter  which adopts wording from the international accounting standards board s iasb international accounting standard no 
inventories in an effort to improve the comparability of cross border financial reporting 
the fasb and iasb both believe the standards have the same intent  however  an amendment to the wording was adopted to avoid inconsistent application 
the new standard indicates that abnormal freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage are required to be treated as current period charges rather than as a portion of inventory cost 
additionally  the standard clarifies that fixed production overhead should be allocated based on the normal capacity of a production facility 
the provisions of this statement will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact that this statement will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  an amendment of sfas no 
and this statement requires that the cost of all forms of equity based compensation granted to employees  excluding employee stock ownership plans  be recognized in a company s income statement and that such cost be measured at the fair value of the stock options 
this statement replaces the guidance in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and is effective for financial statements relating to annual periods beginning after june  we will adopt sfas no 
r beginning on april  we believe the expensing of options may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the pro forma effects 
during april  the board of directors of the company approved the acceleration of vesting of underwater unvested stock options held by certain current employees  including executive officers 
stock options held by non employee directors were not included in the acceleration 
a stock option was considered underwater if the option exercise price was greater than per share  the market price on the date of the acceleration 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 the pro forma compensation expense before income tax that would be recognized had the company accounted for its options under the fair value method related to the april acceleration of vesting of underwater options is million 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp and fsp 
fsp provides guidance on the application of sfas  accounting for income taxes  with regard to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provision within hr the american jobs creation act of act that was enacted on october  fsp provides guidance on a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to qualifying us taxpayers 
the act contains numerous provisions related to corporate and international taxation including repeal of the eti regime  creation of a new domestic production activities dpa deduction and a temporary dividends received deduction related to repatriation of foreign earnings 
the act contains various effective dates and transition periods related to its provisions 
under the guidance provided in fsp the new dpa deduction will be treated as a special deduction as described in sfas as such  the special deduction has no effect on our deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date 
rather  the impact of this deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on our income tax return 
we currently derive benefit from the eti exclusion 
the act reduces our eti exclusion for fiscal and fiscal to and of the otherwise allowable exclusion 
no exclusion will be available in fiscal and beyond 
we do not expect the net effect of the phase out of the eti deduction and phase in of the new dpa deduction to result in a material impact on our effective income tax rate in fiscal in fsp the financial accounting standards board acknowledged that  due to the proximity of the act s enactment date to many companies year ends and the fact that numerous provisions within the act are complex and pending further regulatory guidance  many companies may not be in a position to assess the impacts of the act on their plans for repatriation or reinvestment of foreign earnings 
therefore  the fsp provided companies with a practical exception to the permanent reinvestment standards of sfas and apb no 
by providing additional time to determine the amount of earnings  if any  that they intend to repatriate under the act s provisions 
we are not yet in a position to decide whether  and to what extent  we might repatriate foreign earnings to the us therefore  under the guidance provided in fsp  no deferred tax liability has been recorded in connection with the repatriation provisions of the act 
we are currently analyzing the impact of the temporary dividends received deduction provisions contained in the act 
market risk our primary exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates on borrowings 
an increase in interest rates would adversely affect our operating results and the cash flow available after debt service to fund operations and expansion 
in addition  an increase in interest rates would adversely affect our ability to pay dividends on our common stock  if permitted to do so under certain of our debt arrangements  including our revolving credit facility 
we manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations by optimizing the use of fixed and variable rate debt 
the information below summarizes our market risks associated with debt obligations and should be read in conjunction with note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents principal cash flows and the related interest rates 
fixed interest rates disclosed represent the weighted average rate as of march  variable interest rates disclosed fluctuate with the libor  federal funds rates and other weekly rates and represent the weighted average rate at march  expected years of maturity next months months months months months thereafter total fixed rate cash flows in thousands     weighted average interest rate variable rate cash flows in thousands  weighted average interest rate there are no other significant market risk exposures 
forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of relating to our future operations and prospects  including statements that are based on current projections and expectations about the markets in which we operate  and management s beliefs concerning future performance and capital requirements based upon current available information 
such statements are based on management s beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management 
when used in this document  words like may  might  will  expect  anticipate  believe  potential  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from management s current expectations 
for example  there can be no assurance that additional capital will not be required or that additional capital  if required  will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  at such times and in such amounts as may be needed by us 
in addition to these factors  among other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are uncertainties relating to the integration of acquired businesses  general economic conditions affecting our business segments  dependence of certain of our businesses on certain key customers as well as competitive factors relating to the aviation and metals industries
