years ended december  operating highlights in thousands year over year change revenues    income from operations    net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used in investing activities   net cash provided by financing activities   our revenue growth can be attributed to a combination of organic growth and acquisitions 
on an organic level  we are benefiting from an expanding user and advertiser base and from increased user activity levels across our offerings on the yahoo network 
this revenue growth together with our overall effort to manage discretionary spending has led to the year over year increases in income from operations 
we also continue to acquire companies 
we have completed a number of acquisitions over the past few years  including the acquisitions of inktomi and overture in and  kelkoo  and musicmatch in during the first year of owning a significant acquired company  our practice has been to disaggregate the results and disclose any impact on our revenues and expenses separately 
as a result  until the first anniversary of the acquisition date  the revenues and expenses of our acquired businesses are described as acquisition related in the discussion that follows 
thereafter the underlying results of these acquisitions are considered part of our organic base 
our historical financial statements reflect the impact of these acquired businesses from their respective dates of acquisition and the discussion of our results of operations that follows explains the impact of these acquisitions on our consolidated results to provide information that will assist in understanding the changes in the years presented 
our year over year reported growth rates  calculated on a consolidated basis  include the impact from acquisitions 
excluding the impact from acquisitions  our growth rates would be lower 
cash generated from our operations is a measure of the cash productivity of our business model and is an area of focus for us 
the growth of cash flow from operations demonstrates our commitment to creating value and is primarily a function of our increasing net income  net of increases in our net working capital balances 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities totaling approximately billion  an increase of billion compared to billion as of december  the principal components of the increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities were cash generated from operating activities of approximately billion  proceeds of million from the sale of marketable equity securities and proceeds of million from the exercise of employee stock options  offset by cash used for business combinations of million  capital expenditures of million and million for structured stock repurchase activities 
during the year ended december   we disposed of approximately four million shares of an investment in a publicly traded company and recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million  net of selling costs  which is included in other income  net on the consolidated statements of operations 
we believe the search queries  page views  click throughs and the related marketing services and fees revenues that we generate are correlated to the number of users and the amount of time that these users are spending on our network 
by providing a platform for our users that brings together our search technology  content  and community while allowing for personalization and integration across devices  we seek to become more essential to our users and increase our share of users and deepen their engagement with our products and services 
we believe this deeper engagement of new and existing users  coupled with the expansion of the online advertising market as advertisers shift their spending from traditional media to the internet will increase our revenues in results of operations the following table sets forth selected information on our results of operations as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing product development general and administrative stock compensation expense amortization of intangibles total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before income taxes  earnings in equity interests  minority interests and cumulative effect of accounting change provision for income taxes earnings in equity interests minority interests in operations of consolidated subsidiaries net income before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change net income revenues 
revenues by groups of similar services were as follows dollars in thousands years ended december  change change marketing services    fees    total revenues    percent of total revenues marketing services revenues include revenues previously classified as listings revenues of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
marketing services revenue 
marketing services revenue for the year ended december  increased by approximately  million  or percent as compared to the prior year 
marketing services revenue for the year ended december  increased by approximately million  or percent as compared to the prior year 
the successive year over year growth in our marketing services revenue can be attributed to a combination of acquisitions and organic growth 
incremental revenue from acquisitions contributed approximately  million and million to the increases in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the remainder of the increase  approximately million in and million in  is from organic growth in advertising across the entire yahoo network 
this growth in our marketing services revenues is driven by our growing number of users  advertisers and inventory 
as our user base increases and users spend more time on the yahoo network  they drive a higher number of page views  which we view as inventory  and a higher number of search queries which result in a higher number of impressions and paid clicks 
this increased level of engagement on the yahoo network attracts more advertisers to our advertising services which also contributes to the growth in our marketing services revenue 
on the yahoo network  our number of unique users worldwide as of december  was approximately percent higher than the number of unique users as of december  which was percent higher than december  unique users are the estimated number of people who visited the yahoo network in a given time period 
the combined number of page views and searches  including those from our affiliate network  in and including the effects of acquisitions  increased by approximately percent as compared to with approximately percent of the increase in volume attributable to acquisitions 
the combined number of page views and searches in  including the effects of acquisitions  increased by approximately percent as compared to with approximately percent of the increase in volume attributable to acquisitions 
the increase in the organic volume of page views and searches resulted from the combined effect of an increased number of users  an expanded offering of properties which increases our inventory of page views and the introduction of new sponsored search offerings 
the combined average yield per page view and search increased by approximately percent in compared to  of which approximately one half is attributable to acquisitions 
the combined average yield per page view and search increased by approximately percent in compared to  of which approximately percent is attributable to acquisitions 
the increase in organic yield per page view and search is primarily due to a sales mix change towards higher yielding properties and advertising services 
the average user is also spending more time on our yahoo network 
we believe this increase can be attributed to our expanding offerings as well as our enhanced algorithmic search technology which provides a new level of personalization to the search experience 
we also believe this trend makes our network more attractive to advertisers and increases their spending on our properties 
further  we believe the growth in users on the yahoo network and on the internet overall is reflective of the increasing acceptance  importance and dependence of users on the internet 
as a result of this trend of an increased on line audience  advertisers are shifting more of their spending from traditional media to the internet to reach this growing audience 
fees revenue 
fees revenue in increased approximately million  or percent  as compared to of which million relates to acquisitions 
approximately million was primarily associated with an increase in the number of paying users for our fee based services  which were million at december  compared to million at december  our increasing base of fee paying users is due to a greater penetration of our services with our existing users as well as our continued expansion of service offerings including new business relationships with bt and rogers for fee based services 
these fee based services include internet broadband and dial up services  our premium mail  music and personals offerings as well as our services for small businesses 
average revenue per paying user per month declined to approximately in from in as a result of faster subscriber growth in some of the lower priced offerings  and the introduction of lower priced fee based services 
for the year ended december   fees revenue increased approximately million  or percent  as compared to the prior year 
approximately million was associated with an increase in the number of paying users for our fee based services  which were million at december  compared to million at december  average revenue per paying user per month declined to approximately in from in as a result of faster subscriber growth in some of the lower priced offerings  and the introduction of lower priced fee based services in we currently expect combined revenues for marketing services and fees to increase in absolute dollars for compared to as we seek to increase users and traffic on our yahoo network and benefit from expected growth in the on line advertising market

tac payments commenced following our acquisition of overture in october when we began offering sponsored search services 
we enter into agreements of varying duration that involve tac 
there are generally three economic structures of the affiliate agreements fixed payments based on a guaranteed minimum amount of traffic delivered  which often carry reciprocal performance guarantees from the affiliate  variable payments based on a percentage of our revenue or based on a certain metric  such as number of searches or paid clicks  or a combination of the two 
we expense tac under two methods 
agreements with fixed payments are expensed ratably over the term the fixed payment covers  and agreements based on a percentage of revenue  number of paid introductions  number of searches  or other metrics are expensed based on the volume of the underlying activity or revenue multiplied by the agreed upon price or rate

general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were percent  percent  and percent in   and  respectively 
the decrease is a result of the overall increase in revenues and savings as a result of our overall effort to manage discretionary costs 
we currently believe that general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars will increase in compared to  as we continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our continued organic growth and as we incur a full year of costs in related to acquisitions completed in stock compensation

amortization of intangibles was approximately million  or four percent of revenues for the year ended december   compared to million or three percent of revenues for and million or two percent of revenues for the year over year increases in amortization of intangibles were the result of our continued acquisition activity which has resulted in increased amortizable intangible assets

business segment results we manage our business geographically 
our primary areas of measurement and decision making are the united states and international 
management relies on an internal management reporting process that provides revenue and segment operating income loss before depreciation and amortization for making financial decisions and allocating resources 
segment operating income loss before depreciation and amortization  includes income loss from operations before depreciation  amortization of intangible assets and amortization of stock compensation expense 
management believes that segment operating income loss before depreciation and amortization is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operational performance of the company s segments 
however  this measure should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  or superior to  income loss from operations or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

international revenues accounted for approximately percent of total revenues during as compared to percent during and percent during the growth in our international operations has increased our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
revenues and related expenses generated from our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the local countries 
primary currencies include euros  british pounds  japanese yen  korean won and australian dollars 
the income statements of our international operations are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in increased revenues  operating expenses and net income for our international segment 
similarly  our revenues  operating expenses and net income will decrease for our international segment when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
during  the us dollar weakened against the euro and other foreign currencies as compared to using the average foreign currency exchange rates from  our international revenues for would have been lower than we reported using the actual exchange rates for  by approximately million  and our international segment operating income before depreciation and amortization would have been lower by approximately million

see note acquisitions in the consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to these acquisitions 
we may continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of  or investments in businesses  products  and technologies that are complementary to our business  which may require the use of cash 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur  could materially impact the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are generated from marketing services and fees 
marketing services revenue is generated from several offerings including the display of textual  rich media and graphical advertisements  display of text based links to advertisers listings  listing based services  and commerce based transactions 
fees revenue includes revenue from a variety of consumer and business fee based services 
while the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions  there are certain transactions that contain non standard business terms and conditions 
in addition  we have certain sales transactions that involve multiple element arrangements arrangements with more than one deliverable that may include placement on specific properties and content integration 
we also enter into arrangements to purchase goods and or services from certain customers 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions including if an arrangement exists  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among potential multiple elements  when to recognize revenue on the deliverables  whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered  whether the arrangements should be reported gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and whether we receive a separately identifiable benefit from purchase arrangements with our customers for which we can reasonably estimate fair value 
in addition  our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured  which inherently requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 
changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
deferred income tax asset valuation allowance 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred income tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our operating results  ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would likely increase stockholders equity as substantially all of our net operating losses result from employee stock option deductions 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
our long lived assets include goodwill and other intangible assets and as of december  had a net balance of billion 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates  growth rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit which could trigger impairment 
see note goodwill in the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
based on our impairment test  there would have to be a significant unfavorable change to our assumptions used in such calculations for an impairment to exist 
we amortize other intangible assets over their estimated economic useful lives 
we must record an impairment charge on these assets when we determine that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the carrying value is not recoverable if it exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of intangible assets based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
our estimates of future cash flows attributable to our other intangible assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors 
different assumptions and judgments could materially affect the calculation of the fair value of the other intangible assets which could trigger impairment 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the emergency issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf 
eitf provides guidance on the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain marketable debt and equity securities accounted for under fasb statement no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and non marketable securities accounted for under the cost method 
the eitf developed a basic three step model to evaluate whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb issued fasb staff position eitf  which delays the effective date until additional guidance is issued for the application of the recognition and measurement provisions of eitf to investments in securities that are impaired 
however  the disclosure requirements are effective for annual periods ended after june  and have been reflected in note investments in the financial statements 
we are currently evaluating the effect of this proposed statement on our results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment  which requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  based on their fair values 
accounting for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method supplemented by pro forma disclosures will no longer be permissible 
the new statement will be effective for public entities in periods beginning after june  we have not yet completed our analysis of the impact of adopting fasb statement no 
r and therefore we are currently unable to quantify its effect on our results of operations 
however  we know that the adoption of this new statement will have a significant impact on the results of operations and net income per share as we will be required to expense the fair value of all share based payments 
liquidity and capital resources as of and for the years ended december  dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents    marketable debt securities    total cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities  percentage of total assets net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities   net cash provided by used in financing activities  the company s operating activities for each year in the three years ended december  have generated adequate cash to meet our operating needs 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and marketable debt securities totaling billion  an increase of billion compared to billion as of december  the principal components of the increase were cash generated from operating activities of billion  proceeds of million from the sale of marketable equity securities and proceeds of million from the exercise of employee stock options  partially offset by cash used for acquisitions of million  capital expenditures of million and million for share repurchase activities 
our investments in marketable equity securities which totaled million as of december  are not included above 
as of december   approximately million of earnings held by the company s foreign subsidiaries are designated as indefinitely invested outside the united states 
if these funds were required for our operations in the united states  we would be required to accrue and pay additional taxes to repatriate these funds 
currently  we do not anticipate a need to repatriate these funds to our united states operations 
we invest excess cash predominantly in marketable debt securities that are highly liquid  of high quality investment grade  and predominantly have effective maturities of less than two years 
we also invest excess cash to expand our operations and for potential acquisitions  share repurchase activities or other transactions 
as of december   certain of our marketable debt securities have a fair value below cost due to the changes in market rates of interest and yields on these securities 
we evaluate these investments periodically for possible impairment and review factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis  the financial condition of the issuer  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value 
we have the intent and ability to hold these securities for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value up to or beyond the initial cost of the investment and expect to realize the full value of all of these investments upon maturity or sale 
we expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations in management believes existing cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities  together with any cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet normal operating requirements including capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
however  we may sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities to further enhance our liquidity position  and the sale of additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
cash flow changes cash provided by operating activities has been greater than net income in all three years presented mainly due to the net impact of non cash adjustments to income 
non cash adjustments include depreciation and amortization  tax benefits from stock options  cumulative effect of accounting change  earnings in equity interests  stock compensation expense  as well adjustments for gains and losses from the sale of investments 
in and  operating cash flows were reduced by cash used for working capital needs while in  operating cash flows were positively impacted by changes in working capital balances

the days sales outstanding metric increased slightly from to but remained relatively flat from to in  there was also a significant increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities that provided a positive working capital change

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations  and changes in the market values of our investments 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we invest excess cash in marketable debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december  and we had investments in debt securities with effective maturities between three months and one year of approximately billion and million  respectively 
such investments had a weighted average yield of approximately percent and percent  respectively 
as of december  and we had investments in debt securities with effective maturities between one and five years of approximately billion and billion respectively 
such investments had a weighted average yield of approximately percent and percent  respectively 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease approximately one percent in the fair value of our available for sale securities as of december  and the fair market value of the zero coupon senior convertible notes the notes is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature of the notes 
generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the fair market value of the notes will also increase as the market price of the yahoo stock increases and decrease as the market price falls 
the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the notes but do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
as of december  and  the fair value of the notes was approximately billion and million  respectively based on quoted market prices 
foreign currency risk 
international revenues accounted for approximately percent of total revenues during as compared to percent during the growth in our international operations has increased our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
revenues and related expenses generated from our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the local countries 
primary currencies include euros  british pounds  japanese yen  korean won and australian dollars 
the income statements of our international operations are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in increased revenues  operating expenses and net income for our international segment 
similarly  our revenues  operating expenses and net income will decrease for our international segment when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
during  the us dollar weakened against the euro and other foreign currencies as compared to using the average foreign currency exchange rates from  our international revenues for would have been lower than we reported using the actual exchange rates for  by approximately million and our international segment operating income before depreciation and amortization would have been lower by approximately million 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rates fluctuations as we convert the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars in consolidation 
when there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates  the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars will lead to a translation gain or loss which is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
in addition  we have certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity s functional currency 
changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations that will lead to a transaction gain or loss 
during  we recorded foreign currency transaction gains  realized and unrealized  of approximately million as compared to million and million in and  respectively  which are recorded in other income  net on the consolidated statement of operations 
investment risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
as of december  and  net unrealized losses on these investments were not material 
we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments 
we invest in equity instruments of public companies for business and strategic purposes and have classified these securities as available for sale 
these available for sale equity investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the stock market and the industries in which these companies participate 
we have realized gains and losses from both the sale of investments  as well as mergers and acquisitions of companies in which we have invested 
as of december   we had available for sale equity investments with a fair value of approximately million  classified as current assets and included on the consolidated balance sheets as marketable equity securities 
these equity investments have a total cost basis of approximately million 
our objective in managing exposure to stock market fluctuations is to minimize the impact of stock market declines to earnings and cash flows 
however  continued market volatility  as well as mergers and acquisitions  have the potential to have a material non cash impact on our financial position and or operating results in future periods 
using a hypothetical reduction of percent in the stock price of each of our equity securities  the fair value of our equity investments would decrease by approximately million as of december  our investments in available for sale equity investments were not material as of december
