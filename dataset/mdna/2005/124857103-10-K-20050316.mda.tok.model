the company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials  which allegedly occurred principally as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by westinghouse  a predecessor  generally prior to the early s 
westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos 
the company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases 
in the majority of asbestos lawsuits  the plaintiffs have not identified which of the company s products is the basis of a claim 
claims against the company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos containing insulating material in turbines sold for power generation  industrial and marine use  or by asbestos containing grades of decorative micarta  a laminate used in commercial ships 
claims are frequently filed and or settled in large groups  which may make the amount and timing of settlements  and the number of pending claims  subject to significant fluctuation from period to period

the company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement

the company uses derivative financial instruments to modify exposure to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates

the company manages the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally 
at december   the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was million  of which million related to the hedging of future production costs and million related to the hedging of a net investment in a foreign operation

at december   the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was million  of which million related to the hedging of future productions costs 
the remaining million represented hedges of underlying foreign currency balances  expected foreign currency net cash flows and investment hedges

swap agreements may be used to modify this exposure 
the company has entered into fixed to variable rate swaps  which are designated as fair value hedges 
based on the amount of variable rate debt and receivable securitization programs outstanding at december   a basis point change in interest rates would cause a million change to pre tax earnings 
as of december   if all parties were to agree  the swaps could have been terminated by a net payment from the counterparties of approximately million 
at december   the company was a party to the following outstanding fair value hedges  which were fully effective

revised share based payment sfas r  effective the first interim period or annual reporting period that begins after june  sfas r revises sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issues to employees 
sfas r requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
on march   the compensation committee of the board of directors of the company approved the acceleration of the vesting of unvested stock options having an exercise price of or greater granted under the company s and long term management incentive plans 
stock option awards granted from through with respect to approximately million shares of the company s ii class b common stock are subject to this acceleration which is effective as of march  since these options had exercise prices in excess of the current market value and were not fully achieving their original objectives of incentive compensation and employee retention  the company expects the acceleration to have a positive effect on employee morale  retention and perception of option value 
the acceleration also eliminates future compensation expense the company would otherwise recognize in its consolidated statements of operations once sfas r becomes effective on july  critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
frr considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the company s financial condition and results of operations  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
for a summary of the company s significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
the following accounting policies require significant management judgments and estimates 
accounting for the production and distribution of motion pictures and television programming is in accordance with sop  which requires management s judgment as it relates to total revenues to be received and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each program 
these judgments are used to determine the amortization of capitalized production costs  expensing of participation and residual cost and any necessary net realizable value adjustments 
the company accounts for its business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting 
the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets acquired is recorded as intangibles 
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows  discount rates  asset lives  and market multiples  among other items 
in accordance with sfas  the company tests goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year  and on an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test 
a significant downward revision in the present value of estimated future cash flows for a reporting unit or intangible assets could result in an impairment under sfas and a non cash charge would be required 
balance sheet reserves and liabilities related to legal issues  restructuring charges and discontinued businesses  including asbestos and environmental matters  require significant judgments and estimates by management 
the company continually evaluates these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates 
while management believes that the current reserves for matters related to discontinued businesses  including environmental and asbestos are adequate  there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods 
ii pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions 
two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefit obligations could effectively be settled 
the company used investment grade corporate bond yields to support its discount rate assumption 
the expected return on plan assets assumption was derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets 
for  the unrecognized actuarial loss for pension increased principally as a result of lowering the discount rate for the company s major plans from in to in a decrease in the discount rate or a decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense 
the estimated impact of a basis point change in the discount rate would be a change of approximately million on pension expense and will change the projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
the estimated impact of a basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately million 
the company is subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes 
the company is continually audited by us federal and state as well as foreign tax authorities 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  the company believes that its tax reserves reflect the probable outcome of known contingencies 
an estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to quarterly operating results 
in the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the same quarter 
a number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters  for which a reserve has been established  is audited and finally resolved 
during  the company recognized million of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain prior year tax audits 
risk factors the risk factors listed below  in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report  could affect the business and future results of the company 
past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on its over the air networks  basic cable networks  television stations  radio stations and outdoor businesses 
the sale of advertising is affected by viewer demographics  viewer ratings and market conditions for advertising 
adverse changes to any of these factors  including as a result of acts of terrorism or war  could have a negative effect on revenues 
the company s basic cable networks and premium subscription television networks are dependent upon affiliation agreements with cable and direct to home satellite dth distributors on acceptable terms 
the loss of carriage on such distributors  or continued carriage on less favorable terms  could adversely affect  with respect to basic cable networks  revenues from subscriber fees and the ability to sell advertising and  with respect to premium subscription television networks  subscriber fee revenues 
in addition  continued consolidation among cable programming and or dth distributors and vertical integration of such distributors into the cable or broadcast network business  could have an adverse effect on subscriber fees and advertising revenues  as the company s ability to launch new networks or maintain or obtain additional distribution for existing networks is impacted by these factors 
operating results derived from the company s motion picture and television production businesses fluctuate depending primarily upon cost of such productions and acceptance of such productions by the public  which are difficult to predict 
motion picture and television production has experienced cycles in which increased costs of talent  reduced availability of co financing opportunities  and ii other factors have resulted in higher production costs 
in addition  the commercial success of the company s motion picture and television productions depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing productions  and the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities 
the company s operating results fluctuate due to the timing and availability of theatrical and home video releases  as well as the recording of license fees for television exhibition of motion pictures and for syndication and basic cable exhibition of television programming in the period that the products are available for such exhibition 
in accordance with sfas  the company tests goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year  and on an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test 
a downward revision in the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible assets could result in an impairment under sfas and a non cash charge would be required 
such a charge could have a significant effect on the company s reported net earnings 
while the company seeks to ensure compliance with fcc indecency laws and regulations  the definition of indecency is subject to interpretation and there can be no assurance that employees of the company will not make decisions resulting in the broadcast of programming that is viewed by regulators or the public as not meeting such standards 
such programming could subject the company to regulatory review or investigation  fines  adverse publicity or other sanctions including the loss of station licenses 
technology developments  including digital copying and file compression  and the growing penetration of high bandwidth internet connections  increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute pirated material 
the company takes actions to vigorously enforce its rights and protect its copyrighted materials and products  however there can be no assurance that it will be successful in preventing the distribution of pirated content 
increased piracy of the company s copyrighted materials could negatively affect its operations and financial results 
newer technologies  including video on demand  personal video recorders and other devices that allow users to view television or motion pictures from a remote location or on a time delayed basis  and technologies which implement the ability for users to fast forward  rewind  pause and skip programming may cause changes in consumer behavior that could affect the attractiveness of the company s offerings to viewers  advertisers and or distributors and could therefore have an adverse effect on the company s businesses  particularly its television business 
the company has contingent liabilities related to discontinued businesses  including environmental liabilities  liabilities related to illnesses of former employees  asbestos liabilities and other pending and threatened litigation 
while the pending or threatened litigations and environmental and other liabilities should not have a material adverse effect on the company  there can be no assurance in this regard 
in the operation of its businesses  the company engages the services of writers  directors  actors and others  which are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
work stoppages and or higher costs in connection with these agreements could adversely impact the company s operations 
changes in laws and regulations  including in particular fcc ownership rules and rules related to the carriage of broadcast and multichannel distribution programming  could  directly or indirectly  adversely affect the operations and ownership of the company s properties 
the company s advertiser supported businesses experience fluctuations based on the timing of advertising expenditures by retailers  which typically increase in the fourth quarter 
nai  through its beneficial ownership of the company s class a common stock  has voting control of the company
