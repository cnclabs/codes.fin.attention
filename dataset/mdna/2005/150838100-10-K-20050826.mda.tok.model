item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of north america s fifteen largest truckload carriers  generating approximately million in operating revenue for our fiscal year ended june  we have grown significantly since our incorporation in through internal growth and a series of acquisitions since as a dry van truckload carrier  we generally transport full trailer loads of freight from origin to destination without intermediate stops or handling 
we operate in two main market sectors 
in our international operations  we offer time sensitive transportation in and between the united states and its two largest trading partners  mexico and canada 
we generated approximately one half of our revenue in fiscal from international movements  and we believe our annual border crossings make us the largest provider of international truckload movements in north america 
in addition to our international business  we offer a broad range of truckload transportation services within the us  including regional  long haul  dedicated  and logistics 
we also operate truckersbb  a profitable marketing business that affords volume purchasing power for items such as fuel  tires  and equipment to approximately  member trucking fleets representing approximately  tractors 
under generally accepted accounting principles  truckersbb constitutes a separate operating segment 
information regarding revenue  profits or losses  and total assets of each of our operating segments transportation and e commerce truckersbb is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements filed as part of this report 
recent results and fiscal year end financial condition for the year ended june   total revenue increased  to million from million during fiscal freight revenue  which excludes revenue from fuel surcharges  increased  to million in from million in we generated net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year compared with a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for we believe the improvements in our profitability were attributable primarily to the continued execution of our operating strategy  which involves allocating our equipment to customers and freight that provide the most favorable returns 
the most significant components of this effort were raising rates  diversifying customers and freight mix  and continuing to focus on asset productivity 
our efforts were aided by stronger freight demand and a better rate environment in primarily due to continued growth in the us economy and a favorable relationship between demand and trucking capacity 
as a result  average freight revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharge for increased per mile to  a increase compared with average freight revenue per tractor per week  our main measure of asset productivity  improved by to  in compared with  for these factors more than offset a significant increase in costs  primarily attributable to increased costs of driver compensation  revenue equipment and fuel 
our operating ratio  improved to for compared with for at june   our total balance sheet debt was million and our total stockholders equity was million  for a total debt to capitalization ratio of 
at june   we had million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and million of cash on hand 
stock issuance in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we issued million shares of our common stock in a public offering 
the stock issuance resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
we used the proceeds to repay all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
the balance of the net proceeds was used to pay off debt and leases related to equipment 

table of contents revenue we generate substantially all of our revenue by transporting freight for our customers 
generally  we are paid by the mile or by the load for our services 
we also derive revenue from fuel surcharges  loading and unloading activities  equipment detention  other trucking related services and from truckersbb 
the main factors that affect our revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers  the percentage of miles for which we are compensated  the number of tractors operating  and the number of miles we generate with our equipment 
these factors relate to  among other things  the us economy  inventory levels  the level of truck capacity in our markets  specific customer demand  the percentage of team driven tractors in our fleet  driver availability  and our average length of haul 
we also derive revenue from fuel surcharges  loading and unloading activities  equipment detention  and other accessorial services 
prior to fiscal  we measured total revenue  including fuel and accessorial surcharges 
in fiscal  we disclosed fuel surcharges separately  and our historical financial statements have been reclassified to conform to this presentation 
we believe that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
expenses and profitability the main factors that impact our profitability on the expense side are the variable costs of transporting freight for our customers 
these costs include fuel expense  driver related expenses  such as wages  benefits  training  and recruitment  and independent contractor costs  which we record as purchased transportation 
expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary with the miles we travel  but also have a controllable component based on safety  fleet age  efficiency  and other factors 
our main fixed cost is the acquisition and financing of long term assets  primarily revenue equipment 
we have other mostly fixed costs  such as our non driver personnel 
in discussing our expenses as a percentage of revenue  we sometimes discuss changes as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharges  in addition to absolute dollar charges  because we believe the high variable cost nature of our business makes a comparison of changes in expenses as a percentage of revenue more meaningful at times than absolute dollar changes 
the trucking industry has experienced significant increases in expenses over the past three years  in particular those relating to equipment costs  driver compensation  insurance  and fuel 
as the united states economy has expanded  many trucking companies have been able to raise freight rates to cover the increased costs 
this is primarily due to industry wide tight capacity of drivers 
competition for drivers has become increasingly intense  as the expanding economy has provided alternative jobs at the same time as increasing freight demand 
to obtain capacity  shippers have been willing to accept the largest rate increases in recent history 
as long as freight demand continues to exceed truck capacity  we expect increases in driver pay by many carriers  including us  and higher freight rates 
revenue equipment we operate  tractors and  trailers 
of our tractors at june   were owned   were acquired under operating leases  and were provided by independent contractors  who own and drive their own tractors 
of our trailers at june    were owned and  were acquired under operating and capital leases 
we recognized pre tax impairment charges of million in the first quarter of in relation to the reduced value of our foot trailers 
we acquire most of our tractor fleet and our trailer fleet with operating leases 
these leases generally run for a period of three to four years for tractors and seven years for trailers 
financing revenue equipment acquisitions with operating leases  rather than borrowings or capital leases  moves the interest component of our financing activities into above the line operating expenses on our statements of operations 
we changed our process on our tractor trade cycle from a period of approximately four years to three years 
we evaluated the decision based on maintenance costs  capital requirements  prices of new and used tractors  and other factors 
this resulted in lower maintenance expense in 
table of contents independent contractors owner operators provide a tractor and a driver and are responsible for all operating expenses in exchange for a fixed payment per mile 
we do not have the capital outlay of purchasing the tractor 
the payments to independent contractors are recorded in purchased transportation and the payments for equipment under operating leases are recorded in revenue equipment rentals 
expenses associated with owned equipment  such as interest and depreciation  are not incurred  and for independent contractor tractors  driver compensation  fuel  and other expenses are not incurred 
because obtaining equipment from independent contractors and under operating leases effectively shifts these expenses from interest to above the line operating expenses  we evaluate our efficiency using operating ratio as well as income before income taxes 
outlook looking forward  our profitability goal is to achieve an operating ratio of approximately 
we expect this to require additional improvements miles per tractor per week  rate per mile and decreased non revenue miles  to overcome expected additional cost increases to expand our margins 
because a large percentage of our costs are variable  changes in revenue per mile affect our profitability to a greater extent than changes in miles per tractor 
for  the key factors that we expect to have the greatest effect on our profitability are our freight revenue per tractor per week  our compensation of drivers  our cost of revenue equipment  our fuel costs  our insurance and claims expense and our maintenance expense 
to overcome cost increases and improve our margins  we will need to achieve increases in freight revenue per tractor  particularly in revenue per mile  which we intend to achieve by increasing rates and continuing to shift to more profitable freight 
operationally  we will seek improvements in safety  driver recruiting and retention 
our success in these areas primarily will affect revenue  driver related expenses  and insurance and claims expense 

table of contents results of operations the following tables set forth the percentage relationship of revenue and expense items to operating and freight revenue for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended june  operating revenue operating expenses salaries  wages  and employee benefits fuel operations and maintenance insurance and claims depreciation  amortization  and impairment charges revenue equipment rentals purchased transportation cost of products and services sold professional and consulting fees communication and utilities operating taxes and licenses general and other operating total operating expenses operating income other income expense interest expense  net other income expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss freight revenue operating expenses salaries  wages  and employee benefits fuel operations and maintenance insurance and claims depreciation  amortization  and impairment charges revenue equipment rentals purchased transportation cost of products and services sold professional and consulting fees communication and utilities operating taxes and licenses general and other operating total operating expenses operating income other income expense interest expense  net other income expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss includes a million trailer impairment charge in fiscal includes a  pretax write off of unamortized loan origination costs for refinancing our line of credit in fiscal freight revenue is total revenue less fuel surcharges 
in this table  fuel surcharges are eliminated from revenue and subtracted from fuel expense 
the amounts were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 

table of contents fiscal year ended june   compared with fiscal year ended june  total revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal freight revenue excludes million and million of fuel surcharge revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
freight revenue increased by million  or to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to a improvement in average revenue per total mile  excluding fuel surcharge  to from 
the improvement in average revenue per total mile resulted primarily from better overall freight rates in fiscal  a decrease in the percentage of our freight comprised of automotive parts and a corresponding increase in the percentage of our freight comprised of consumer non durables 
revenue per tractor per week  excluding fuel surcharge  which is our primary measure of asset productivity  increased to  in fiscal  from  for fiscal  as a result of an increase in revenue per mile 
revenue for truckersbb was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the truckersbb revenue decrease resulted from a decrease in member usage of various programs  the largest being the tire discount programs  due to an industry wide shortage of tires 
salaries  wages  and employee benefits were million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal the increase in the overall dollar amount primarily was related to a increase in company miles  which in turn increased driver wages 
the remaining increase in this expense category was due to an increase in the percentage of our fleet comprised of company trucks  and an increase in administrative payroll related expenses 
fuel expenses  net of fuel surcharge revenue of million and million for fiscal and  respectively increased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for the same period in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to a increase in company miles and an increase in average fuel prices of approximately per gallon 
in addition  fuel expense was reduced by a million fuel tax refund in  relating to prior years 
we expect fuel prices may remain at relatively high levels due to low inventory and unrest in the middle east 
higher fuel prices will increase our operating expenses to the extent we cannot offset them with surcharges 
operations and maintenance consist of direct operating expense  maintenance  and tire expense 
this category increased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal this dollar amount increase was primarily the result of increased expenses to repair tractors for trade in in fiscal  partially offset by decreases in maintenance expense due to our fleet upgrade initiative and management changes in our maintenance area 
as a percentage of freight revenue  operations and maintenance decreased to of revenue for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the decrease in maintenance expense as a percentage of revenue in the fiscal period was primarily the result of our fleet upgrade initiative  implementing a tractor trade cycle change from years to years as well as reducing our trailer fleet to a year trade cycle in fiscal  offset by increased expenses to repair tractors for trade in 
we expect our maintenance expense will continue to decrease as a percentage of revenue due to these initiatives 
insurance and claims expense was million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal the primary reason for the decrease in insurance and claims expense relates to one significant accident that occurred and was accrued for in the fourth quarter of fiscal our insurance expense consists of premiums and deductible amounts for liability  physical damage  and cargo damage insurance 
our insurance program involves self insurance at various risk retention levels 
claims in excess of these risk levels are covered by insurance in amounts we consider to be adequate 
we accrue for the uninsured portion of claims based on known claims and historical experience 
insurance and claims expense will vary based primarily on the frequency and severity of claims  the level of self retention and the premium expense 

table of contents depreciation and amortization  consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment  decreased to million  or of freight revenue  in fiscal from million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to the pretax impairment charge of million  or of freight revenue  in fiscal related to the disposal of all foot trailers in addition to foot trailers over nine years old 
we disposed of approximately  model year trailers and replaced them with  model year trailers 
in addition  we have increased our use of operating leases to finance acquisitions of revenue equipment 
revenue equipment held under operating leases is not reflected on our balance sheet and the expenses related to such equipment are reflected on our statements of operations in revenue equipment rentals  rather than in depreciation and amortization and interest expense  as is the case for revenue equipment that is financed with borrowings or capital leases 
we expect to use available cash generated from operations to purchase new tractors and trailers  which will increase depreciation  with the remaining additions to be acquired under off balance sheet operating leases 
revenue equipment rentals were million  or of freight revenue  in fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal as of june   we had financed  tractors and  trailers under operating leases as compared to  tractors and  trailers as of june this increase was attributable to a higher proportion of our tractor and trailer fleet held under operating leases during the period 
as we expect to acquire new tractors and trailers with operating leases  we expect revenue equipment rentals will increase going forward 
however  the rate of increase may slow as we generate cash from operations to purchase new tractors and trailers 
purchased transportation decreased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  from million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal this decrease was primarily related to reduced independent contractor expense  as the percentage of our fleet comprised of independent contractors decreased to independent contractors at june  from at june  this decrease was partially offset due to increased payments to independent contractors resulting from fuel surcharges collected due to rising fuel costs  which are passed through to our independent contractors on a per mile basis 
independent contractors are drivers who cover all their operating expenses fuel  driver salaries  maintenance  and equipment costs for a fixed payment per mile 
we expect the majority of our equipment additions to come in our company operated fleet 
as a result  the percentage of our fleet comprised of independent contractors may continue to decline  with a corresponding decrease in this expense category 
it has become difficult to recruit and retain independent contractors 
all of our other operating expenses are relatively minor in amount  and there were no significant changes in these expenses 
net interest expense decreased to million in fiscal  or of freight revenue  from million  or of freight revenue  in fiscal the decrease was the result of reduced bank borrowings  of which we had none at june   compared to million at june   and reduced capital lease obligations  which decreased to million at june   from million at june  the reduction in our capital lease obligations has resulted largely from our increased use of operating leases to make acquisitions of new revenue equipment 
the reduction in bank borrowings and other debt resulted from the use of the proceeds of our secondary offering completed in may and from increased working capital related to our increased profitability in fiscal our pretax margin  which we believe is a useful measure of our operating performance because it is neutral with regard to the method of revenue equipment financing that a company uses  improved to of freight revenue for fiscal from for fiscal  including the impact of the million pretax impairment charge 
in addition to other factors described above  canadian exchange rate fluctuations principally impact salaries  wages  and benefits and purchased transportation and  therefore  impact our pretax margin and results of operations 
income taxes increased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal the effective tax rate decreased as a result of the tax effect of final settlement with the internal revenue service related to all of our consolidated federal income tax returns through fiscal year june   recorded in fiscal due to the non deductible effects of our driver per diem pay structure  our tax rate will fluctuate in future periods as income fluctuates 

table of contents fiscal year ended june   compared with fiscal year ended june  total revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal freight revenue excludes million and million of fuel surcharge revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
freight revenue increased by million  or to million in fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to a improvement in average revenue per total mile  excluding fuel surcharge  from to  a increase in average miles per tractor per week  from  to  and a increase in average tractors from  to  the improvement in average revenue per total mile resulted primarily from better overall freight rates in fiscal  a decrease in the percentage of our freight comprised of automotive parts and a corresponding increase in the percentage of our freight comprised of consumer non durables  and to a lesser extent a reduction in our percentage of non revenue miles 
the increase in miles per tractor per week was primarily attributable to stronger overall freight demand in the period 
revenue per tractor per week  excluding fuel surcharge  which is our primary measure of asset productivity  increased to  in fiscal  from  for fiscal  as a result of increases in revenue per mile and miles per tractor 
the increase in average tractors was primarily related to our acquisition of certain assets of highway in the first quarter of fiscal revenue for truckersbb was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the truckersbb revenue increase resulted from an increase in member usage of various programs  including the fuel and tire discount programs 
salaries  wages  and employee benefits were million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal the increase in the overall dollar amount primarily was related to a increase in company miles  which in turn increased driver wages 
the increase in this expense category was primarily attributable to an increase in the percentage of our fleet comprised of company trucks  an increase in driver compensation  and an increase in administrative payroll and related expenses for the highway express employees 
fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge of million and million for fiscal and  increased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for the same period in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to a increase in company miles and an increase in average fuel prices of approximately per gallon 
in addition  fuel expense in was reduced by a million fuel tax refund relating to prior years 
we expect fuel prices may remain at relatively high levels due to low inventory and unrest in the middle east 
higher fuel prices will increase our operating expenses to the extent we cannot offset them with surcharges 
operations and maintenance expenses increased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal this dollar amount increase was primarily the result of our larger fleet of company operated equipment in fiscal as a percentage of freight revenue  operations and maintenance decreased to of revenue for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the decrease in maintenance expense as a percentage of freight revenue in the fiscal period was primarily the result of our fleet upgrade initiative  as newer tractors and trailers generally require less maintenance  which was partially offset by a larger percentage of our fleet being comprised of company operated equipment in the fiscal period 
operations and maintenance consist of direct operating expense  maintenance and tire expense 
insurance and claims expense was million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal the primary reason for the increase in insurance and claims expense relates to one significant accident that occurred and was accrued for in the fourth quarter of fiscal our insurance expenses consist of premiums for liability  physical damage  and cargo damage insurance 
our insurance program involves self insurance at various risk retention levels 
claims in excess of these risk levels are covered by insurance in amounts we consider to be adequate 
we accrue for the uninsured portion of claims based on known claims and historical experience 
we regularly evaluate our insurance program in an effort to maintain a balance between premium expense and the risk retention we are willing to assume 

table of contents depreciation and amortization  consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment  increased to million  or of freight revenue  in fiscal from million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the pretax impairment charge of million  or of operating revenue in fiscal related to a plan to dispose of all foot trailers in addition to foot trailers over nine years old 
we disposed of approximately  model year trailers and replaced them with  model year trailers 
we also incurred higher depreciation due to the equipment we acquired in the highway express acquisition and losses on disposition of some of the tractors acquired from burlington motor carriers 
these items were partially offset by our increased use of operating leases to finance acquisitions of revenue equipment 
revenue equipment rentals were million  or of freight revenue  in fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal this increase was attributable to a higher proportion of our tractor and trailer fleet held under operating leases during the period 
purchased transportation decreased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  from million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal this decrease was primarily related to reduced independent contractor expense  as the percentage of our fleet comprised of independent contractors decreased 
independent contractors are drivers who cover all their operating expenses fuel  driver salaries  maintenance  and equipment costs for a fixed payment per mile 
all of our other operating expenses are relatively minor in amount  and there were no significant changes in these expenses 
net interest expense decreased to million in fiscal  or of freight revenue  from million  or of freight revenue  in fiscal the decrease was the result of reduced bank borrowings  which decreased to million at june   from million at june   reduced capital lease obligations  which decreased to million at june   from million at june   and a one time pretax write off of unamortized loan origination costs of approximately million related to the refinancing of our line of credit in fiscal the reduction in our capital lease obligations has resulted largely from our increased use of operating leases to finance acquisitions of new revenue equipment 
the reduction in bank borrowings and other debt resulted from the use of the proceeds of our secondary offering completed in may and from increased working capital related to our increased profitability in fiscal our pretax margin  which we believe is a useful measure of our operating performance because it is neutral with regard to the method of revenue equipment financing that a company uses  decreased to  for fiscal  including the impact of the million pretax impairment charge  and a million fuel tax refund  from for fiscal  including the impact of a one time pretax write off of unamortized loan origination costs of approximately million related to the refinancing of our line of credit 
in addition to other factors described above  canadian exchange rate fluctuations principally impact salaries  wages  and benefits and purchased transportation and  therefore  impact our pretax margin and results of operations 
income taxes increased million to million for fiscal  from million  for fiscal the effective tax rate increased as a result of an increase in non deductible expenses related to our driver per diem pay structure  in addition to the tax effect of final settlement with the internal revenue service related to all of the company s consolidated federal income tax returns through fiscal year june  as per diem charges are partially non deductible for income tax purposes  our tax rate will fluctuate as our net income fluctuates 
liquidity and capital resources trucking is a capital intensive business 
we require cash to fund our operating expenses other than depreciation and amortization  to make capital expenditures and acquisitions  and to repay debt  including principal and interest payments 
other than ordinary operating expenses  we anticipate that capital expenditures for the acquisition of revenue equipment will constitute our primary cash requirement over the next twelve months 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations  bank borrowings  capital and operating lease financing of revenue equipment  and proceeds from the sale of used revenue equipment 

table of contents as of june   we had on order  tractors for delivery through these revenue equipment orders represent a capital commitment of approximately million  before considering the proceeds of equipment dispositions 
in connection with our fleet upgrade  we have financed most of the new tractors and new trailers we have acquired to date under off balance sheet operating leases 
a portion of the used equipment that has been or will be replaced by these new units was or is owned or held under capital leases and  therefore  carried on our balance sheet 
as a result of our increased use of operating leases to make acquisitions of revenue equipment  we have reduced our balance sheet debt 
at june   our total balance sheet debt  including capital lease obligations and current maturities  was million  compared to million at june   and million at june  our debt to capitalization ratio total balance sheet debt as a percentage of total balance sheet debt plus total stockholders equity decreased to at june   from at june   and at june  net of cash on hand at june  of million  our debt to capitalization ratio was 
we believe we will be able to fund our operating expenses  as well as our current commitments for the acquisition of revenue equipment  over the next twelve months with a combination of cash generated from operations  borrowings available under our primary credit facility  and lease financing arrangements 
our reduction in outstanding indebtedness with the cash generated from operations and application of the net proceeds of our stock offering significantly increased the availability under our primary credit facility for working capital and other purposes 
subject to any required lender approval  we may make acquisitions  although we do not have any specific acquisition plans at this time 
we will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long term  and the availability of the needed capital will depend upon our financial condition and operating results and numerous other factors over which we have limited or no control  including prevailing market conditions and the market price of our common stock 
however  based on our improving operating results  anticipated future cash flows  current availability under our credit facility  as well as increased borrowing availability following the application of offering proceeds  and sources of equipment lease financing that we expect will be available to us  we do not expect to experience significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
cash flows we generated net cash from operating activities of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal from fiscal is due primarily to the decrease in income tax payable 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for fiscal and net cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal approximately million of the cash used in investing activities for fiscal was related to our purchase of certain assets of cx roberson in january of in addition  cash used in provided by investing activities includes the net cash effect of acquisitions and dispositions of revenue equipment during each year 
capital expenditures totaled million in fiscal  including the value of equipment purchased under capital leases and excluding the assets purchased from cx roberson  million in fiscal  including the value of equipment purchased under capital leases and excluding the assets purchased from highway express  and million in fiscal we generated proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of million in fiscal including million from the cx roberson acquisition  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal financing activity represents bank borrowings new borrowings  net of repayments and payment of the principal component of capital lease obligations 
in fiscal  we received approximately million from the issuance of common stock 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements operating leases have been an important source of financing for our revenue equipment 
we lease a significant portion of our tractor and trailer fleet using operating leases 
in connection with substantially all of our operating leases  we have issued residual value guarantees  which provide that if we do not purchase the leased equipment from the lessor at the end of the lease term  then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage if any between the proceeds from the sale of the equipment and an agreed value 
with respect to a minority of our equipment held under operating leases  we have obtained from the manufacturers residual value guarantees that meet or exceed the amount of our guarantee to the lessor 
to the extent the expected value at the lease termination date is lower than the residual value guarantee  we would accrue for the difference over the remaining lease term 
we currently believe that proceeds from the sale of equipment held under operating leases would exceed the amount of our residual obligation on all operating leases 
over the past several years  we have financed most of our new tractors and trailers under operating leases  which are not reflected on our balance sheet 
the use of operating leases also affects our statement of cash flows 
for assets subject to these operating leases  we do not record depreciation as an increase to net cash provided by operations  nor do we record any entry with respect to investing activities or financing activities 
our operating leases include some under which we do not guarantee the value of the asset at the end of the lease term walk away leases and some under which we do guarantee the value of the asset at the end of the lease term 
we were obligated for residual value payments related to operating leases of million at june  compared to million at june  a small portion of these amounts is covered by repurchase and or trade agreements we have with the equipment manufacturer 
we believe that any residual payment obligation that are not covered by the manufacturer will be satisfied  in the aggregate  by the value of the related equipment at the end of the lease 
to the extent the expected value at the lease termination date is lower than the residual value guarantee  we would accrue for the difference over the remaining lease term 
we anticipate that going forward we will use operating leases and cash generated from operations to finance the acquisition of revenue equipment 
primary credit agreement on september   we entered into our current primary credit facility with fleet capital corporation  fleet capital canada corporation and several other lenders 
this million facility consists of revolving loan facilities  and a commitment to issue and guaranty letters of credit 
repayment of the amounts outstanding under the credit facility is secured by a lien on our assets  including the stock or other equity interests of our subsidiaries  and the assets of certain of our subsidiaries 
in addition  certain of our subsidiaries that are not party to the credit facility have guaranteed repayment of the amount outstanding under the credit facility and have granted a lien on their respective assets to secure such repayment 
the credit facility expires on september  we are currently reviewing credit facility proposals and expect to have a new or revised credit facility in place on september  amounts available under the credit facility are determined based on our accounts receivable borrowing base 
the facility contains restrictive covenants  which  among other things  limit our ability to pay cash dividends and make capital expenditures and lease payments  and require us to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios  including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
we were in compliance with these covenants at june   and expect to remain in compliance 
at june   none of our credit facility was utilized as outstanding borrowings and million was utilized for standby letters of credit  and we had approximately million in remaining availability under the facility 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments as of june   our bank loans  capitalized leases  operating leases  other debts  and future commitments have stated maturities or minimum annual payments as follows annual cash requirements as of june  in thousands amounts due by period total less than one year one to three years three to five years over five years operating leases lease residual value guarantees capital lease obligations long term debt sub total future purchase of revenue equipment employment and consulting agreements standby letters of credit total contractual and cash obligations includes interest 
the amounts reflected in the table do not include amounts that could become payable to our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  under certain circumstances if their employment by the company is terminated 
inflation many of our operating expenses  including fuel costs and revenue equipment  are sensitive to the effects of inflation  which result in higher operating costs and reduced operating income 
the effects of inflation on our business during the past three years were most significant in fuel 
we have limited the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and fuel surcharges 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
therefore  the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and associated disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities are affected by these estimates and assumptions 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts  and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions  and it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using differing estimates or assumptions 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements 
our critical accounting policies include the following depreciation of property and equipment 
we depreciate our property and equipment using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset 
we generally use estimated useful lives of to years for tractors and trailers  and estimated salvage values for tractors and trailers generally range from to of the capitalized cost 
gains and losses on the disposal of revenue equipment are included in depreciation expense in our statements of operations 

table of contents we review the reasonableness of our estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and other long lived assets based upon  among other things  our experience with similar assets  conditions in the used equipment market  and prevailing industry practice 
changes in our useful life or salvage value estimates  or fluctuations in market values that are not reflected in our estimates  could have a material effect on our results of operations 
revenue equipment and other long lived assets are tested for impairment whenever an event occurs that indicates an impairment may exist 
expected future cash flows are used to analyze whether an impairment has occurred 
if the sum of expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the long lived asset  then an impairment loss is recognized 
we measure the impairment loss by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis or the appraised or estimated market value of the asset  as appropriate 
operating leases 
we have financed a majority of our revenue equipment acquisitions with operating leases  rather than with bank borrowings or capital lease arrangements 
these leases generally contain residual value guarantees  which provide that the value of equipment returned to the lessor at the end of the lease term will be no lower than a negotiated amount 
to the extent that the value of the equipment is below the negotiated amount  we are liable to the lessor for the shortage at the expiration of the lease 
for approximately of our tractors and of our trailers under operating lease  we have residual value guarantees at amounts equal to our residual obligation to the lessors 
for all other equipment or to the extent we believe any manufacturer will refuse or be unable to meet its obligation  we are required to recognize additional rental expense to the extent we believe the fair market value at the lease termination will be less than our obligation to the lessor 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for leases  property and equipment held under operating leases  and liabilities related thereto  are not reflected on our balance sheet 
all expenses related to revenue equipment operating leases are reflected on our statements of operations in the line item entitled revenue equipment rentals 
as such  financing revenue equipment with operating leases instead of bank borrowings or capital leases effectively moves the interest component of the financing arrangement into operating expenses on our statements of operations 
consequently  we believe that pretax margin income before income taxes as a percentage of operating revenue may provide a more useful measure of our operating performance than operating ratio operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue because it eliminates the impact of revenue equipment financing decisions 
claims reserves and estimates 
the primary claims arising for us consist of cargo liability  personal injury  property damage  collision and comprehensive  workers compensation  and employee medical expenses 
we maintain self insurance levels for these various areas of risk and have established reserves to cover these self insured liabilities 
we also maintain insurance to cover liabilities in excess of these self insurance amounts 
claims reserves represent accruals for the estimated uninsured portion of reported claims  including adverse development of reported claims  as well as estimates of incurred but not reported claims 
reported claims and related loss reserves are estimated by third party administrators  and we refer to these estimates in establishing our reserves 
claims incurred but not reported are estimated based on our historical experience and industry trends  which are continually monitored  and accruals are adjusted when warranted by changes in facts and circumstances 
in establishing our reserves we must take into account and estimate various factors  including  but not limited to  assumptions concerning the nature and severity of the claim  the effect of the jurisdiction on any award or settlement  the length of time until ultimate resolution  inflation rates in health care and in general  interest rates  legal expenses  and other factors 
our actual experience may be different than our estimates  sometimes significantly 
changes in assumptions as well as changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term 
insurance and claims expense will vary from period to period based on the severity and frequency of claims incurred in a given period 
accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes represent a substantial liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
deferred income taxes are determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we evaluate our tax assets and liabilities on a periodic basis and adjust these balances as appropriate 
we believe that we have adequately provided for our future tax consequences based upon current facts and circumstances and current tax law 
however  should our tax positions be challenged and not prevail  different outcomes could result and have a significant impact on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the carrying value of our deferred tax assets tax benefits expected to be realized in the future assumes that we will be able to generate  based on certain estimates and assumptions  sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize these deferred tax benefits 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to reduce the value of the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense 
we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowance  will be realized  based on forecasted income 
however  there can be no assurance that we will meet our forecasts of future income 
we evaluate the deferred tax assets on a periodic basis and assess the need for additional valuation allowances 
federal income taxes are provided on that portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the united states 
factors that may affect future results the following risks and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating our business and growth outlook 
our business is subject to general economic and business factors that are largely out of our control  any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results 
our business is dependent on a number of factors that may have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations  many of which are beyond our control 
some of the most significant of these factors include excess tractor and trailer capacity in the trucking industry  declines in the resale value of used equipment  strikes or other work stoppages  or work slow downs at our facilities or at customer  port border crossing or other shipping related facilities  increases in interest rates  fuel taxes  tolls  and license and registration fees  rising costs of healthcare  and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we are also affected by recessionary economic cycles  changes in customers inventory levels  and downturns in customers business cycles  particularly in market segments and industries  such as retail and manufacturing  where we have a significant concentration of customers  and regions of the country  such as texas and the midwest  where we have a significant amount of business 
economic conditions may adversely affect our customers and their ability to pay for our services 
customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss and we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
these economic conditions and good economic and business factors could have a mutually adverse effect on or ability to execute our strategic plan 
in addition  it is not possible to predict the effects of actual or threatened terrorist attacks  efforts to combat terrorism  military action against any foreign state  heightened security requirements  or other related events 
such events  however  could negatively impact the economy and consumer confidence in the united states 
such events could impede shipping efficiency  especially at border crossings and have a materially adverse effect on our future results of operations 
moreover  our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors 
customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather  which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher repairs and maintenance costs 
we self insure for a significant portion of our claims exposure  which could significantly increase the volatility of  and decrease the amount of  our earnings 
our future insurance and claims expense could reduce our earnings and make our earnings more volatile 
we currently self insure for a portion of our claims exposure and accrue amounts for liabilities based on our assessment of claims that arise and our insurance coverage for the periods in which the claims arise 
in general  for casualty claims for fiscal  we are self insured for the first million of each personal injury and property damage claim and the first thousand of each cargo claim 
we are also responsible for a pro rata portion of legal expenses relating to such claims 
we maintain a workers compensation plan and group medical plan for our employees with a deductible amount of million for each workers compensation claim and a stop loss amount of  for each group medical claim 
because of our significant self insured retention amounts  we have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims 
if there is an increase in the frequency and severity of claims  or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts if the claims prove to be more severe than originally assessed  our profitability would be adversely affected and could vary significantly from period to period 

table of contents we maintain insurance above the amounts for which we self insure with licensed insurance carriers 
our insurance and claims expense could increase when our current coverages expire or we could raise our self insured retention 
if these expenses increase  our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 
ongoing insurance requirements could constrain our borrowing capacity 
at june   our revolving line of credit had a maximum borrowing limit of million  no outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit of million 
however  our borrowings may increase if we do acquisitions  finance more of our equipment under the revolving line of credit  and we do expect outstanding letters of credit to increase in the future 
outstanding letters of credit reduce the available borrowings under our credit agreement 
these factors could negatively affect our liquidity should we need to increase our borrowings in the future 
we operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry  and numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain or improve our current profitability 
these factors include q we compete with many other truckload carriers of varying sizes and  to a lesser extent  with less than truckload carriers  railroads  and other transportation companies  many of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do 
q many of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business  especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy  which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or maintain significant growth in our business 
q many customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting so called core carriers as approved service providers  and in some instances we may not be selected 
q many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs  and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors 
q the trend toward consolidation in the trucking industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size 
q advances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive  and our customers may not be willing to accept higher freight rates to cover the cost of these investments 
q competition from non asset based logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect our customer relationships and freight rates 
q economies of scale that may be passed on to smaller carriers by procurement aggregation providers may improve their ability to compete with us 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from our major customers  the loss of one or more of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from our major customers 
for  our top customers  based on revenue  accounted for approximately of our revenue  and our top customers  approximately of our revenue 
we do not expect these percentages to change materially for generally  we do not have long term contractual relationships with our major customers  and we cannot assure you that our customers will continue to use our services or that they will continue at the same levels 
for some of our customers  we have entered into multi year contracts and we cannot be assured that the rates will remain advantageous 
a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
increases in compensation or difficulty in attracting drivers could affect our profitability and ability to grow 
the trucking industry experiences substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers  including independent contractors 
our ability to attract and retain drivers could be adversely affected by increased availability of alternative employment opportunities in an economic expansion and by the potential need for more drivers due to more restrictive driver hours of service requirements imposed by the us department of transportation effective january if we are unable to continue to attract drivers and contract with independent contractors  we could be required to adjust our driver compensation package  let trucks sit idle  or operate with fewer independent contractors and face difficulty meeting shipper demands  all of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 
our growth may not continue at historical rates  which could adversely affect our stock price 
we experienced significant growth in revenue between and there can be no assurance that our revenue growth rate will continue at historical levels or that we can effectively adapt our management  administrative  and operational systems to respond to any future growth 
we can provide no assurance that our operating margins will not be adversely affected by future changes in and expansion of our business or by changes in economic conditions 
slower or less profitable growth could adversely affect our stock price 

table of contents we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with  or liability for violation of  existing or future regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
our operations are regulated and licensed by various us  canadian  and mexican agencies 
our company drivers and independent contractors also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the united states department of transportation  or dot  including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service 
such matters as weight and equipment dimensions are also subject to us and canadian regulations 
we also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions  drivers hours of service  ergonomics  or other matters affecting safety or operating methods 
future laws and regulations may be more stringent and require changes in our operating practices  influence the demand for transportation services  or require us to incur significant additional costs 
higher costs incurred by us or by our suppliers who pass the costs onto us through higher prices would adversely affect our results of operations 
beginning in  motor carriers were required to comply with several changes to dot hours of service requirements that may have a positive or negative effect on driver hours and miles and our operations 
a citizens advocacy group successfully petitioned the courts that the new rules were developed without driver health in mind 
pending further action by the courts or the effectiveness of new rules addressing these issues  congress has enacted a law that extends the effectiveness of the new rules until september  we cannot predict whether there will be changes to the hours of service rules  the extent of any changes  or whether there will be further court challenges 
given this uncertainty  we are unable to determine the future effect of driver hour regulations on our operations 
the dot is also considering implementing higher safety requirements on trucks 
these regulatory changes may have an adverse affect on our future profitability 
federal  state  and local taxes comprise a significant part of our expenses 
as such  we actively manage these expenses when executing our business strategy 
consequently  when we believe it is appropriate  we use a number of structures to permanently decrease our overall tax liability or to defer tax payments 
as part of our fleet upgrade and acquisition strategy we have significant ongoing capital requirements that could affect our profitability if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and obtain financing on favorable terms 
the truckload industry is capital intensive  and our policy of operating newer equipment requires us to expend significant amounts annually 
for the past few years  we have depended on operating leases  cash from operations  and our line of credit to fund our revenue equipment 
if we elect to expand our fleet in future periods  our capital needs would increase 
we expect to pay for projected capital expenditures with operating leases of revenue equipment  cash flows from operations  and borrowings under our line of credit 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and obtain financing on favorable terms in the future  we may have to limit our growth  enter into less favorable financing arrangements  or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods  any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability 
we currently have lease residual value guarantees of approximately million  substantially all of which are not covered by trade in or fixed residual agreements with the equipment supplier 
we are exposed to decreases in the resale value of our used equipment and we have increased exposure to issues on the growing percentage of our fleet not covered by manufacturer commitments which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations 
fluctuations in the price or availability of fuel  as well as hedging activities  surcharge collection  and the volume and terms of diesel fuel purchase commitments  may increase our cost of operation  which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 
fuel is one of our largest operating expenses 
diesel fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to economic  political  and other factors beyond our control 
for example  our average price for diesel fuel was per gallon in  as compared to per gallon in fuel is also subject to regional pricing differences and often costs more on the west coast  where we have significant operations 
from time to time we have used fuel surcharges  hedging contracts  and volume purchase arrangements to attempt to limit the effect of price fluctuations 
although we impose fuel surcharges on substantially all accounts  these arrangements do not fully protect us from fuel price increases and also may result in us not receiving the full benefit of any fuel price decreases 
we currently do not have any fuel hedging contracts in place 
if we do hedge  we may be forced to make cash payments under the hedging arrangements 
based on current market conditions we have decided to limit our hedging and purchase commitments  but we continue to evaluate such measures 
the absence of meaningful fuel price protection through these measures  fluctuations in fuel pries  or a shortage of diesel fuel  could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents we may not make acquisitions in the future  or if we do  we may not be successful in our acquisition strategy 
we made eight acquisitions  including two between and accordingly  acquisitions have provided a substantial portion of our growth 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in identifying  negotiating or consummating any future acquisitions 
if we fail to make any future acquisitions  our growth rate could be materially and adversely affected 
any acquisitions we undertake could involve the dilutive issuance of equity securities and or incurring indebtedness 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilating the acquired company s operations  the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering into markets in which we have had no or only limited direct experience  and the potential loss of customers  key employees  and drivers of the acquired company  all of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we make acquisitions in the future  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate the acquired companies or assets into our business 
our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 
such laws and regulations deal with the hauling and handling of hazardous materials  fuel storage tanks  air emissions from our vehicles and facilities  and discharge and retention of storm water 
we operate in industrial areas  where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located  and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred 
our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage  environmental damage  and hazardous waste disposal  among others 
we also maintain underground bulk fuel storage tanks and fueling islands at two of our facilities 
a small percentage of our freight consists of low grade hazardous substances  which subjects us to a wide array of regulations 
if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances  if there are releases of hazardous substances we transport  or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations  we could be subject to liabilities that could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations  we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payments  an amendment of fasb on accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r requires companies to recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees 
sfas r is effective for most public companies with interim or annual periods beginning after june  we will adopt this statement effective july  our adoption of sfas r will impact our results of operations by increasing salaries  wages and related expenses 
the amount of the expected impact is still being reviewed by the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we experience various market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and fuel prices 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor when there are no underlying related exposures 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk principally from our primary credit facility 
the credit facility carries a maximum variable interest rate of either the bank s base rate plus or libor plus 
at june   the interest rate for revolving borrowings under our credit facility was libor plus 
at june   we had no variable rate term loan borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
a hypothetical increase in the bank s base rate and libor would be immaterial to our net income 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk  specifically in connection with our canadian operations 
while virtually all of the expenses associated with our canadian operations  such as independent contractor costs  company driver compensation  and administrative costs  are paid in canadian dollars  a significant portion of our revenue generated from those operations is billed in us dollars because many of our customers are us shippers transporting goods to or from canada 
as a result  increases in the canadian dollar exchange rate adversely affect the profitability of our canadian operations 
assuming revenue and expenses for our canadian operations identical to the year ended june  both in terms of amount and currency mix  we estimate that a increase in the canadian dollar exchange rate would reduce our annual net income by approximately  in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activity  an amendment of sfas which requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings 
as of june   we had none of our currency exposure hedged 
derivative contracts had no material impact on our results of operations for the year ended june  
table of contents we generally do not face the same magnitude of foreign currency exchange rate risk in connection with our intra mexico operations conducted through our mexican subsidiary  jaguar  because our foreign currency revenues are generally proportionate to our foreign currency expenses for those operations 
for purposes of consolidation  however  the operating results earned by our subsidiaries  including jaguar  in foreign currencies are converted into united states dollars 
as a result  a decrease in the value of the mexican peso could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 
assuming revenue and expenses for our mexican operations identical to the year ended june  both in terms of amount and currency mix  we estimate that a decrease in the mexican peso exchange rate would not have a material effect on our annual net income 
commodity price risk 
shortages of fuel  increases in prices  or rationing of petroleum products can have a materially adverse effect on our operations and profitability 
fuel is subject to economic  political and market factors that are outside of our control 
historically  we have sought to recover a portion of short term increases in fuel prices from customers through the collection of fuel surcharges 
however  fuel surcharges do not always fully offset increases in fuel prices 
in addition  from time to time we may enter into derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
in accordance with sfas  we adjust any derivative instruments to fair value through earnings on a monthly basis 
as of june   we had none of our estimated fuel purchases hedged 
derivative contracts had no material impact on our results of operations for the year ended june
