item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in fiscal  our diluted earnings per share increased by to and our net revenues increased to billion from billion in fiscal the net revenues increase was primarily driven by increases in the pottery barn  pottery barn kids  pbteen and williams sonoma concepts 
increasing our revenues was a key strategic initiative for us in and we are pleased to have been able to deliver these results  despite a significantly weaker than expected consumer response to the holiday merchandising strategies in the pottery barn brand in the fourth quarter 
in our retail channel  net revenues increased during fiscal versus fiscal this increase was primarily driven by a year over year increase in retail leased square footage of  including net new stores  and a comparable store sales increase of 
net sales generated in the pottery barn  williams sonoma  and pottery barn kids brands were the primary contributors to the year over year sales increase  partially offset by the transitional impact of our hold everything brand realignment strategy 
we achieved positive comparable store sales growth in each of our core brands in fiscal in our direct to customer channel  net revenues increased during fiscal versus fiscal this year over year increase was primarily driven by net sales generated in the pottery barn  pbteen  pottery barn kids and west elm brands resulting from increased catalog and page count circulation and the continued success of our e commerce initiatives  as well as incremental net sales generated by the november launch of the hold everything e commerce website 
all of the brands in the direct to customer channel delivered positive growth during the fiscal year with the exception of the chambers brand  which was retired in the second quarter of in anticipation of the launch of the williams sonoma home brand in the third quarter of in our core brands  net sales increased in  primarily driven by net sales increases in both the pottery barn and pottery barn kids brands and a mid single digit net sales increase in the williams sonoma brand 
in our emerging brands  including pbteen  west elm  hold everything  and williams sonoma home  net sales increased  primarily driven by strong performance in the pbteen and west elm brands 
net sales in in the pbteen brand increased primarily driven by incremental sales from the e commerce website that was launched in october and a increase in catalog circulation 
although we continue to believe that it is too early to predict the ultimate growth potential of pbteen  the strong consumer response to this brand leads us to believe that we have identified another underserved market segment in the home  similar to pottery barn kids  that could provide a significant long term growth opportunity for the future 
net sales in the west elm brand increased primarily driven by significant growth in the e commerce channel and an extremely successful retail launch 
in late  we opened three new prototype stores in the west elm brand  all of which currently rank in the top volume producing stores in the company 
net sales in in the hold everything brand increased 
within the brand  was a year of significant transition in both the merchandising strategy and the lifestyle positioning of the brand 
during  we added significant management resources and infrastructure to support the future growth of the brand 
in the direct to customer channel  we increased catalog prospecting to revitalize the customer database and launched the first hold everything e commerce website in november 
we also opened three new prototype stores in november 
although the overall growth in the hold everything brand met our expectations in  its growth potential was limited by the breadth of the current merchandise assortment 
we are currently in the process of developing substantially expanded assortments for and our newest brand  williams sonoma home  was launched in the third quarter of on a circulation of over million catalogs  net sales in the brand were in line with the low end of our expectations 
what we found especially encouraging about the initial consumer response to the overall merchandise assortment was the stronger than expected demand for custom upholstered furniture  which we believe speaks to the long term competitive advantage that we can create in this brand by leveraging the strength of our supply chain organization 

table of contents during fiscal  we also continued to improve our pre tax operating margin  increasing from in to in this increase in the pre tax operating margin was the result of several successful operational initiatives  including a reduction in shipping costs as a percentage of net revenues driven by the ongoing consolidation of freight providers  the in sourcing of line haul management in the furniture delivery network  and the strategic positioning of our coastal distribution centers in the proximity of our customer base  a reduction in telecommunication expenses driven by the renegotiation of our company wide vendor agreements  and a reduction in corporate overhead expenses as a percentage of net revenues due to strong expense management initiatives  primarily in employment and employment related expenses 
during  we made progress in building our infrastructure to support the growth of our core and emerging brands 
in the information technology area  we entered into two strategic vendor partnerships with ibm one to host and manage our data center and one to host our e commerce websites 
these agreements were entered into in order to more cost effectively manage our information technology infrastructure  while at the same time  enhancing the functionality of our e commerce websites 
we also continued to invest in our new direct to customer order management and inventory management systems  which are currently in beta testing in our hold everything brand 
these multi phase  multi year technology initiatives are at the heart of our long term efforts to drive increased sales and reduced costs through productivity and operational efficiency 
in the area of inventory management and distribution operations  we increased our distribution center leased square footage  in part by opening our first east coast distribution center in cranbury  new jersey 
we also made progress on our weeks of supply inventory management initiative  which resulted in a reduction in the base levels of our inventory due to more efficiently flowing merchandise through the supply chain 
the sustainable benefit of this initiative  however  will not be realized until we implement our new merchandising systems in as we enter  we will continue to focus on our three long term strategic initiatives driving profitable top line sales growth  increasing pre tax operating margin  and enhancing shareholder value 
to drive profitable top line sales growth  we expect to add net new retail locations  increase catalog circulation  expand customer contacts through electronic direct marketing  and intensify the marketing support behind our bridal and gift registry businesses 
in our emerging brands  we plan to focus on executing initiatives that we believe will build brand awareness and enhance customer access to the brands 
in pbteen in  we plan to increase catalog circulation and expand our successful on line marketing initiatives 
we also plan to drive aggressive name capture programs to expand our teen affinity database 
in west elm  we plan to increase catalog circulation and open seven new retail stores 
we continue to believe that west elm has the potential to be our largest brand  if we can successfully evolve the merchandising strategy  broaden the overall consumer appeal  and capture the mind share of the large consumer segment that west elm targets 
in williams sonoma home in  we plan to increase catalog circulation  add catalog ordering functionality to the current e catalog website  and open three new prototype stores in the third quarter 
we believe that the retail launch in williams sonoma home is strategic to expanding the multi channel reach of the brand due to the customer s desire to interact with the product and fully experience the design authority of the brand 
in hold everything  we plan to significantly refine our catalog circulation strategy  expand our on line marketing initiatives  and open two additional prototype stores 
we also plan to introduce new merchandise assortments throughout the year that will reflect the lifestyle transition of the brand  including a significantly enhanced assortment in furniture  casual upholstery  textiles  lighting  and tabletop 

table of contents to increase our pre tax operating margin  we expect to implement operational disciplines throughout the supply chain to reduce returns  replacements and damages  particularly in furniture  improve our furniture sourcing and inventory management disciplines by implementing a long term capacity and production planning process with key strategic vendors  and in source the management of a primary furniture hub to develop a new gold standard for customer service and to improve the overall operational efficiency of the furniture supply chain process 
additionally  we plan to test on a national basis a new store replenishment program 
during  we will begin replenishing our retail store inventories on a daily basis with ups providing the transportation services 
the long term benefits of this new replenishment program are to improve customer service by reducing out of stocks in the stores  to reduce inventories in the back rooms of our stores and in local off site storage locations  and to reduce inventory damages and shrinkage due to less handling of the merchandise 
in the short term  however  we expect to incur additional costs to implement this test  which we estimate at approximately per share in to enhance shareholder value  we remain committed to delivering against all three of our key strategies including reaching three new financial milestones surpassing billion in revenues  achieving a pre tax operating margin  and delivering the highest diluted earnings per share in the history of the company

among other things  weather conditions can affect comparable store sales because inclement weather can require us to close certain stores temporarily and thus reduce store traffic 
even if stores are not closed  many customers may decide to avoid going to stores in bad weather 
these factors have caused our comparable store sales to fluctuate significantly in the past on an annual  quarterly and monthly basis and  as a result  we expect that comparable store sales will continue to fluctuate in the future

in november  the fasb issued fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value 
in general  the interpretation applies to contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying obligation that is related to an asset  liability  or an equity security of the guaranteed party 
we leased an aircraft over a term of months  which ended in january at the end of the lease term  the lease allowed us to either purchase the aircraft for  or sell it 
if the proceeds were less than  we were required to pay the lessor the difference up to  in january  we purchased the aircraft for  and the lessor released our guarantee requirements 
in addition  we are party to a variety of contractual agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters 
these contracts primarily relate to our commercial contracts  operating leases  trademarks  intellectual property  financial agreements and various other agreements 
under these contracts  we may provide certain routine indemnifications relating to representations and warranties or personal injury matters 
the terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined 
historically  we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications 
we believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters  the loss would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
consolidation of memphis based distribution facilities our memphis based distribution facilities include an operating lease entered into in july for a distribution facility in memphis  tennessee 
the lessor is a general partnership partnership comprised of w 
howard lester  chairman of the board of directors and a significant shareholder  and james a 
mcmahan  a director emeritus and a significant shareholder 
partnership does not have operations separate from the leasing of this distribution facility and does not have lease agreements with any unrelated third parties 
partnership financed the construction of this distribution facility through the sale of a total of  of industrial development bonds in and annual principal payments and monthly interest payments are required through maturity in december the partnership industrial development bonds are collateralized by the distribution facility and the individual partners guarantee the bond repayments 
as of january    was outstanding under the partnership industrial development bonds 

table of contents the operating lease for this distribution facility requires us to pay annual rent of  plus interest on the bonds calculated at a variable rate determined monthly in january  applicable taxes  insurance and maintenance expenses 
although the current term of the lease expires in august  we are obligated to renew the operating lease until these bonds are fully repaid 
our other memphis based distribution facility includes an operating lease entered into in august for another distribution facility that is adjoined to the partnership facility in memphis  tennessee 
the lessor is a general partnership partnership comprised of w 
howard lester  james a 
mcmahan and two unrelated parties 
partnership does not have operations separate from the leasing of this distribution facility and does not have lease agreements with any unrelated third parties 
partnership financed the construction of this distribution facility and related addition through the sale of a total of  of industrial development bonds in and quarterly interest and annual principal payments are required through maturity in august the partnership industrial development bonds are collateralized by the distribution facility and require us to maintain certain financial covenants 
as of january    was outstanding under the partnership industrial development bonds 
the operating lease for this distribution facility requires us to pay annual rent of approximately  plus applicable taxes  insurance and maintenance expenses 
this operating lease has a term of years expiring in august  with three optional five year renewal periods 
we are  however  obligated to renew the lease until the bonds are fully repaid 
as of february   the company adopted fin r  which requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
the two partnerships described above qualify as variable interest entities under fin r due to their related party relationship and our obligation to renew the leases until the bonds are fully repaid 
accordingly  the two related party variable interest entity partnerships from which we lease our memphis based distribution facilities were consolidated by us as of february  as of january   the consolidation had resulted in increases to our consolidated balance sheet of  in assets primarily buildings   in long term debt  and  in other long term liabilities 
consolidation of these partnerships did not have an impact on our net income 
however  the interest expense associated with the partnerships long term debt  shown as occupancy expense in fiscal  is now recorded as interest expense 
in fiscal  this interest expense approximated  impact of inflation the impact of inflation on our results of operations for the past three fiscal years has not been significant 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis and are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories  net of an allowance for excess quantities and obsolescence  are stated at the lower of cost weighted average method or market 
we estimate a provision for damaged  obsolete  excess and slow moving inventory based on inventory aging reports and specific identification 
we reserve  based on inventory aging reports  for of the cost of all inventory between one and two years old and of the cost of all 
table of contents inventory over two years old 
if actual obsolescence is different from our estimate  we will adjust our provision accordingly 
specific reserves are also recorded in the event the cost of the inventory exceeds the fair market value 
in addition  on a monthly basis  we estimate a reserve for expected shrinkage at the concept and channel level based on historical shrinkage factors and our current inventory levels 
actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based on the results of our physical inventory count and can vary from our estimates due to such factors as changes in operations within our distribution centers  the mix of our inventory which ranges from large furniture to small tabletop items and execution against loss prevention initiatives in our stores  off site storage locations  and our third party transportation providers 
prepaid catalog expenses prepaid catalog expenses consist of third party incremental direct costs  including creative design  paper  printing  postage and mailing costs for all of our direct response catalogs 
such costs are capitalized as prepaid catalog expenses and are amortized over their expected period of future benefit 
such amortization is based upon the ratio of actual revenues to the total of actual and estimated future revenues on an individual catalog basis 
estimated future revenues are based upon various factors such as the total number of catalogs and pages circulated  the probability and magnitude of consumer response and the assortment of merchandise offered 
each catalog is generally fully amortized over a six to nine month period  with the majority of the amortization occurring within the first four to five months 
prepaid catalog expenses are evaluated for realizability on a monthly basis by comparing the carrying amount associated with each catalog to the estimated probable remaining future profitability remaining net revenues less merchandise cost of goods sold  selling expenses and catalog related costs associated with that catalog 
if the catalog is not expected to be profitable  the carrying amount of the catalog is impaired accordingly 
property and equipment depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the decision to close  relocate  remodel or expand a store prior to the end of its lease term can result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life of the long lived assets 
for any early store closures where a lease obligation still exists  we record the estimated future liability associated with the rental obligation on the date the store is closed in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
however  most store closures occur upon the lease expiration 
we review the carrying value of all long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review for impairment all stores for which current cash flows from operations are negative or the construction costs are significantly in excess of the amount originally expected 
impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows over the life of the lease 
our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the lease term typically to years is based upon our experience  historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability and economic conditions 
the future estimates of store profitability and economic conditions require estimating such factors as sales growth  employment rates  lease escalations  inflation on operating expenses and the overall economics of the retail industry for up to twenty years in the future  and are therefore subject to variability and difficult to predict 
if a long lived asset is found to be impaired  the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset s fair value 
the fair value is estimated based upon future cash flows discounted at a rate that approximates our weighted average cost of capital or other reasonable estimates of fair market value 
see note a to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding property and equipment 
self insured liabilities we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  employee health benefits and product and general liability insurance 
we record self insurance liabilities based on claims filed  including the development of those claims  and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
factors affecting this estimate include future inflation rates  changes in severity  benefit level changes  medical costs  and claim settlement patterns 
should a 
table of contents different amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or costs of the claims increase or decrease beyond what was anticipated  reserves may need to be adjusted accordingly in future periods 
our workers compensation liability is determined by an actuary 
reserves for self insurance liabilities are recorded within accrued salaries  benefits and other on our consolidated balance sheet 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues and the related cost of goods sold including shipping costs at the time the products are received by customers in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized for retail sales excluding home delivered merchandise at the point of sale in the store and for home delivered merchandise and direct to customer sales when the merchandise is delivered to the customer 
discounts provided to customers are accounted for as a reduction of sales 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns in each reporting period 
shipping and handling fees charged to the customer are recognized as revenue at the time the products are delivered to the customer 
sales return reserve our customers may return purchased items for an exchange or refund 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns  net of cost of goods sold  based on historical return trends together with current product sales performance 
if actual returns  net of cost of goods sold  are different than those projected by management  the estimated sales return reserve will be adjusted accordingly 
income taxes we record reserves for estimates of probable settlements of foreign and domestic tax audits 
at any one time  many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues 
our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings 
stock based compensation we account for stock options granted to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
accordingly  no compensation expense has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements for stock options  as we grant all stock options with an exercise price equal to the market price of our common stock at the date of grant 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  however  requires the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share as if we had adopted the fair value method 
under sfas no 
 the fair value of stock based awards to employees is calculated through the use of option pricing models 
these models require subjective assumptions  including future stock price volatility and expected time to exercise  which affect the calculated values 
our calculations are based on a single option valuation approach  and forfeitures are recognized as they occur 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r will require us to measure and record compensation expense in our consolidated financial statements for all employee share based compensation awards using a fair value method 
in addition  the adoption of sfas no 
r requires additional accounting and disclosure related to the income tax and cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangements 
we expect to adopt this statement using the modified prospective application transition method beginning in the third quarter of fiscal we are currently in the process of determining the impact of the adoption of this statement on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no

risk factors the following information describes certain significant risks and uncertainties inherent in our business 
you should carefully consider such risks and uncertainties  together with the other information contained in this annual report on form k and in our other public filings 
if any of such risks and uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition or operating results could differ materially from the plans  projections and other forward looking statements included in the section titled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings 
in addition  if any of the following risks and uncertainties  or if any other disclosed risks and uncertainties  actually occurs  our business  financial condition or operating results could be harmed substantially  which could cause the market price of our stock to decline  perhaps significantly 
we must successfully anticipate changing consumer preferences and buying trends  and manage our inventory commensurate with customer demand 
our success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing merchandise trends and customer demands 
consumer preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and may change between sales seasons 
changes in customer preferences and buying trends may also affect our brands differently 
if we misjudge either the market for our merchandise or our customers purchasing habits  our sales may decline significantly  and we may be required to mark down certain products to sell the resulting excess inventory or to sell such inventory through our outlet stores or other liquidation channels at prices which are significantly lower than our retail prices  each of which would negatively impact our business and operating results 
in addition  we must manage our inventory effectively and commensurate with customer demand 
much of our inventory is sourced from vendors located outside the us thus  we usually must order merchandise  and enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of such merchandise  well in advance of the applicable selling season and frequently before trends are known 
the extended lead times for many of our purchases may make it difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing trends 
our vendors may also not have the capacity to handle our demands 
in addition  the seasonal nature of the specialty home products business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory prior to peak selling season 
as a result  we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to misjudgments in the selection and timing of merchandise purchases 
if we do not accurately predict our customers preferences and acceptance levels of our products  our inventory levels will not be appropriate  and our business and operating results may be negatively impacted 
our business depends  in part  on factors affecting consumer spending that are out of our control 
our business depends on consumer demand for our products and  consequently  is sensitive to a number of factors that influence consumer spending  including general economic conditions  disposable consumer income  fuel prices  recession and fears of recession  war and fears of war  inclement weather  consumer debt  interest rates  sales tax rates and rate increases  consumer confidence in future economic conditions and political conditions  and consumer perceptions of personal well being and security 
these factors may also affect our various brands and channels differently 
adverse changes in factors affecting discretionary consumer spending could reduce consumer demand for our products  thus reducing our sales and negatively impacting our business and operating results 

table of contents we face intense competition from companies with brands or products similar to ours 
the specialty retail and direct to customer business is highly competitive 
our specialty retail stores  mail order catalogs and e commerce websites compete with other retail stores  other mail order catalogs and other e commerce websites that market lines of merchandise similar to ours 
we compete with national  regional and local businesses utilizing a similar retail store strategy  as well as traditional furniture stores  department stores and specialty stores 
the substantial sales growth in the direct to customer industry within the last decade has encouraged the entry of many new competitors and an increase in competition from established companies 
the competitive challenges facing us include anticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer demands better than our competitors  maintaining favorable brand recognition and achieving customer perception of value  effectively marketing and competitively pricing our products to consumers in several diverse market segments  and developing innovative  high quality products in colors and styles that appeal to consumers of varying age groups and tastes  and in ways that favorably distinguish us from our competitors 
in light of the many competitive challenges facing us  we may not be able to compete successfully 
increased competition could negatively impact our sales  operating results and business 
we depend on key domestic and foreign vendors for timely and effective sourcing of our merchandise  and we are subject to various risks and uncertainties that might affect our vendors ability to produce quality merchandise 
our performance depends on our ability to purchase our merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices 
we purchase our merchandise from numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers and importers 
we have no contractual assurances of continued supply  pricing or access to new products  and any vendor could change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us at any time 
we may not be able to acquire desired merchandise in sufficient quantities on terms acceptable to us in the future 
better than expected sales demand may also lead to customer backorders and lower in stock positions of our products 
any inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of one or more key vendors could have a negative effect on our business and operating results because we would be missing products that we felt were important to our assortment  unless and until alternative supply arrangements are secured 
we may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors  and products from alternative sources  if any  may be of a lesser quality and or more expensive than those we currently purchase 
in addition  we are subject to certain risks  including availability of raw materials  labor disputes  union organizing activities  vendor financial liquidity  inclement weather  natural disasters  rising fuel prices and general economic and political conditions  that could limit our vendors ability to provide us with quality merchandise on a timely basis and at a price that is commercially acceptable 
for these or other reasons  one or more of our vendors might not adhere to our quality control standards  and we might not identify the deficiency before merchandise ships to our stores or customers 
in addition  our vendors may have difficulty adjusting to our changing demands and growing business 
our vendors failure to manufacture or import quality merchandise in a timely and effective manner could damage our reputation and brands  and could lead to an increase in customer litigation against us and an attendant increase in our routine litigation costs 
our dependence on foreign vendors subjects us to a variety of risks and uncertainties 
in fiscal  we sourced our products from manufacturers in countries outside of the united states 
approximately of our merchandise purchases were foreign sourced  primarily from asia and europe 
our dependence on foreign vendors means that we may be affected by declines in the relative value of the us dollar to other foreign currencies 
although substantially all of our foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in us dollars  declines in foreign currencies and currency exchange rates might negatively affect the profitability and business prospects of one or more of our foreign vendors 
this  in turn  might cause such foreign vendors to demand higher prices for merchandise  delay merchandise shipments to us  or discontinue selling to us  any of which could ultimately reduce our sales or increase our costs 

table of contents we are also subject to other risks and uncertainties associated with changing economic and political conditions in foreign countries 
these risks and uncertainties include import duties and quotas  concerns over anti dumping  work stoppages  economic uncertainties including inflation  foreign government regulations  war and fears of war  political unrest  natural disasters  rising fuel prices and other trade restrictions 
we cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our products are currently manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to trade restrictions imposed by the us or foreign governments or the likelihood  type or effect of any such restrictions 
any event causing a disruption or delay of imports from foreign vendors  including the imposition of additional import restrictions  restrictions on the transfer of funds and or increased tariffs or quotas  or both  against home centered items could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
furthermore  some or all of our foreign vendors operations may be adversely affected by political and financial instability resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries  restrictions on the transfer of funds and or other trade disruptions 
in addition  although we continue to improve our global compliance program  there remains a risk that one or more of our foreign vendors will not adhere to our global compliance standards such as fair labor standards and the prohibition on child labor 
non governmental organizations might attempt to create an unfavorable impression of our sourcing practices or the practices of some of our vendors that could harm our image 
if either of these occurs  we could lose customer goodwill and favorable brand recognition  which could negatively affect our business and operating results 
the growth of our sales and profits depends  in large part  on our ability to successfully open new stores 
in each of the past three fiscal years  approximately of our net revenues have been generated by our retail stores 
during  we opened new and remodeled retail stores as part of our growth strategy 
the growth of our sales and profits depend  in large part  on our ability to successfully open new stores 
our ability to open additional stores successfully will depend upon a number of factors  including our identification and availability of suitable store locations  our success in negotiating leases on acceptable terms  our ability to secure required governmental permits and approvals  our hiring and training of skilled store operating personnel  especially management  our timely development of new stores  including the availability of construction materials and labor and the absence of significant construction and other delays in store openings based on weather or other events  the availability of financing on acceptable terms  if at all  and general economic conditions 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
for example  for the purpose of identifying suitable store locations  we rely  in part  on demographic surveys regarding the location of consumers in our target market segments 
while we believe that the surveys and other relevant information are helpful indicators of suitable store locations  we recognize that the information sources cannot predict future consumer preferences and buying trends with complete accuracy 
in addition  changes in demographics  in the types of merchandise that we sell and in the pricing of our products may reduce the number of suitable store locations 
further  time frames for lease negotiations and store development vary from location to location and can be subject to unforeseen delays 
construction and other delays in store openings could have a negative impact on our business and operating results 
we may not be able to open new stores or  if opened  operate those stores profitably 
we must timely and effectively deliver merchandise to our stores and customers 
we cannot control all of the various factors that might affect our fulfillment rates in direct to customer sales and timely and effective merchandise delivery to our stores 
we rely upon third party carriers for our merchandise shipments and reliable data regarding the timing of those shipments  including shipments to our customers and to and from all of our stores 
accordingly  we are subject to the risks  including labor disputes such as the west coast port strike of  union organizing activity  inclement weather  natural disasters  and possible acts of 
table of contents terrorism associated with such carriers ability to provide delivery services to meet our shipping needs 
failure to deliver merchandise in a timely and effective manner could damage our reputation and brands 
in addition  fuel costs have increased substantially and airline companies struggle to operate profitably  which could lead to increased fulfillment expenses 
the increased fulfillment costs could negatively affect our business and operating results by increasing our transportation costs and  therefore  decreasing the efficiency of our shipments 
our failure to successfully manage our order taking and fulfillment operations and our e commerce websites could have a negative impact on our business 
the operation of our direct to customer business depends on our ability to maintain the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our order taking and fulfillment operations and our e commerce websites 
disruptions or slowdowns in these areas could result from disruptions in telephone service or power outages  inadequate system capacity  system issues  security breaches  human error  changes in programming  union organizing activity  natural disasters or adverse weather conditions 
these problems could result in a reduction in sales as well as increased selling  general and administrative expenses 
in addition  we face the risk that we cannot hire enough qualified employees  especially during our peak season  to support our direct to customer operations  due to war or other circumstances that reduce the relevant workforce 
the need to operate with fewer employees could negatively impact our customer service levels and our operations 
our facilities and systems  as well as those of our vendors  are vulnerable to natural disasters and other unexpected events  and any of these events could result in an interruption in our business 
our corporate offices  distribution centers  infrastructure projects and direct to customer operations  as well as the operations of vendors from which we receive goods and services  are vulnerable to damage from earthquakes  fire  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  and similar events 
if any of these events results in damage to our facilities or systems  or those of our vendors  we may experience interruptions in our business until the damage is repaired  resulting in the potential loss of customers and revenues 
in addition  we may incur costs in repairing any damage beyond our applicable insurance coverage 
we experience fluctuations in our comparable store sales 
our success depends  in part  upon our ability to increase sales at our existing stores 
various factors affect comparable store sales  including the number of stores we open  close and expand in any period  the general retail sales environment  consumer preferences and buying trends  changes in sales mix among distribution channels  our ability to efficiently source and distribute products  changes in our merchandise mix  competition  current local and global economic conditions  the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events  the success of marketing programs  and the cannibalization of existing store sales by new stores 
among other things  weather conditions can affect comparable store sales because inclement weather can require us to close certain stores temporarily and thus reduce store traffic 
even if stores are not closed  many customers may decide to avoid going to stores in bad weather 
these factors may cause our comparable store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from earnings guidance we have provided 
our comparable store sales have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual  quarterly and monthly basis  and we expect that comparable store sales will continue to fluctuate in the future 
our comparable store sales increases for fiscal years  and were  and  respectively 
past comparable store sales are no indication of future results  and comparable store sales may decrease in the future 
our ability to maintain and improve our comparable store sales results depends in large part on maintaining and improving our forecasting of customer demand and buying trends  selecting effective marketing techniques  providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our broad and diverse customer base and using more effective pricing strategies 
any failure to meet the comparable store sales expectations of investors and security analysts in one or more future periods could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock 

table of contents our failure to successfully manage the costs and performance of our catalog mailings might have a negative impact on our business 
postal rate increases  paper costs  printing costs and other catalog distribution costs affect the cost of our catalog mailings 
we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure  such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting by zip code and carrier routes 
our cost of paper has fluctuated significantly during the past three fiscal years  and our paper costs are expected to increase in the future 
although we have entered into a long term contract for catalog printing  this contract offers no assurance that our catalog production costs will not substantially increase following its expiration 
future increases in postal rates or paper or printing costs would have a negative impact on our operating results to the extent that we are unable to pass such increases on directly to customers or offset such increases by raising prices or by implementing more efficient printing  mailing  delivery and order fulfillment systems 
we have historically experienced fluctuations in customer response to our catalogs 
customer response to our catalogs is substantially dependent on merchandise assortment  merchandise availability and creative presentation  as well as the sizing and timing of delivery of the catalogs 
in addition  environmental organizations may attempt to create an unfavorable impression of our paper use in catalogs 
the failure to effectively produce or distribute our catalogs could affect the timing of catalog delivery  which could cause customers to forego or defer purchases 
we must successfully manage our internet business 
the success of our internet business depends  in part  on factors over which we have limited control 
in addition to changing consumer preferences and buying trends relating to internet usage  we are vulnerable to certain additional risks and uncertainties associated with the internet  including changes in required technology interfaces  website downtime and other technical failures  changes in applicable federal and state regulation  security breaches  and consumer privacy concerns 
our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties might adversely affect the sales in our internet business  as well as damage our reputation and brands 
our failure to successfully anticipate merchandise returns might have a negative impact on our business 
we record a reserve for merchandise returns based on historical return trends together with current product sales performance in each reporting period 
if actual returns are greater than those projected by management  additional sales returns might be recorded in the future 
actual merchandise returns may exceed our reserves 
in addition  to the extent that returned merchandise is damaged  we may not receive full retail value from the resale or liquidation of the merchandise 
further  the introduction of new merchandise  changes in merchandise mix  changes in consumer confidence  or other competitive and general economic conditions may cause actual returns to exceed merchandise return reserves 
any significant increase in merchandise returns that exceeds our reserves could negatively impact our business and operating results 
we must successfully manage the complexities associated with a multi channel and multi brand business 
during the past few years  with the launch and expansion of our internet business  new brands and brand expansions  our overall business has become substantially more complex 
the changes in our business have forced us to develop new expertise and face new challenges  risks and uncertainties 
for example  we face the risk that our internet business might cannibalize a significant portion of our retail and catalog businesses 
while we recognize that our internet sales cannot be entirely incremental to sales through our retail and catalog channels  we seek to attract as many new customers as possible to our e commerce websites 
we continually analyze the business results of our three channels and the relationships among the channels  in an effort to find opportunities to build incremental sales 
however  as our internet business grows and as we add e commerce websites for more of our concepts  these increased internet sales may cannibalize a portion of our retail and catalog businesses 

table of contents we may not be able to introduce new brands and brand extensions  or to re position existing brands  to improve our business 
we have recently introduced three new brands west elm  pbteen and williams sonoma home  and repositioned our hold everything brand  and may introduce new brands and brand extensions  or reposition existing brands  in the future 
if we devote time and resources to new brands  brand extensions or brand repositioning  and those businesses are not as successful as we planned  then we risk damaging our overall business results 
alternatively  if our new brands  brand extensions or repositioned brands prove to be very successful  we risk hurting our other existing brands through the potential migration of existing brand customers to the new businesses 
we may not be able to introduce new brands  brand extensions or to reposition brands in a manner that improves our overall business and operating results 
our inability to obtain commercial insurance at acceptable prices might have a negative impact on our business 
insurance costs continue to be volatile  affected by natural catastrophes  fear of terrorism and financial irregularities and other fraud at publicly traded companies 
we believe that commercial insurance coverage is prudent for risk management and insurance costs may increase substantially in the future 
in addition  for certain types or levels of risk  such as risks associated with earthquakes or terrorist attacks  we might determine that we cannot obtain commercial insurance at acceptable prices 
therefore  we might choose to forego or limit our purchase of relevant commercial insurance  choosing instead to self insure one or more types or levels of risks 
if we suffer a substantial loss that is not covered by commercial insurance  the loss and attendant expenses could negatively impact our business and operating results 
our inability or failure to protect our intellectual property would have a negative impact on our business 
our trademarks  service marks  copyrights  patents  trade dress rights  trade secrets  domain names and other intellectual property are valuable assets that are critical to our success 
the unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our intellectual property could diminish the value of our brands or goodwill and cause a decline in our sales 
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property 
in addition  the costs of defending our intellectual property may adversely affect our operating results 
we have been sued and may be named in additional lawsuits in a growing number of industry wide business method patent litigation cases relating to our business operations 
there appears to be a growing number of business method patent infringement lawsuits instituted against companies such as ours 
the plaintiff in each case claims to hold a patent that covers certain technology or methodologies which are allegedly infringed by the operation of the defendants business 
we are currently a defendant in such patent infringement cases and may be named in others in the future  as part of an industry wide trend 
even in cases where a plaintiff s claim lacks merit  the defense costs in a patent infringement case can be high 
additional patent infringement claims may be brought against us  and the cost of defending such claims or the ultimate resolution of such claims may negatively impact our business and operating results 
we need to successfully manage our employment  occupancy and other operating costs 
to be successful  we need to manage our operating costs and continue to look for opportunities to reduce costs 
we recognize that we may need to increase the number of our employees  especially in peak sales seasons  and incur other expenses to support new brands and brand extensions  as well as the opening of new stores and direct to customer growth of our existing brands 
although we strive to secure long term contracts with our service providers and other vendors and to otherwise limit our financial commitment to them  we may not be able to avoid unexpected operating cost increases in the future 
in addition  there appears to be a growing number of wage and hour lawsuits against retail companies  especially in california 
we are currently a defendant in such cases and may be named in others in the future 
from time to time we may also experience union organizing activity in currently non union distribution facilities  stores and direct to customer operations 
union organizing activity may result in work slowdowns or stoppages 
table of contents and higher labor costs  which would harm our business and operating results 
further  we incur substantial costs to warehouse and distribute our inventory 
significant increases in our inventory levels may result in increased warehousing and distribution costs 
higher than expected costs  particularly if coupled with lower than expected sales  would negatively impact our business and operating results 
we are planning certain systems changes that might disrupt our supply chain operations 
our success depends on our ability to source and distribute merchandise efficiently through appropriate systems and procedures 
we are in the process of substantially modifying our information technology systems supporting the product pipeline  including design  sourcing  merchandise planning  forecasting and purchase order  inventory  distribution  transportation and price management 
modifications will involve updating or replacing legacy systems with successor systems during the course of several years 
there are inherent risks associated with replacing our core systems  including supply chain and merchandising systems disruptions that affect our ability to get the correct products into the appropriate stores and delivered to customers 
we may not successfully launch these new systems  or the launch may result in supply chain and merchandising systems disruptions 
any such disruptions could negatively impact our business and operating results 
we are implementing changes to our data center information technology infrastructure that might disrupt our business and cost more than expected 
we have engaged ibm to host and manage certain aspects of our data center information technology infrastructure 
accordingly  we are subject to the risks associated with ibm s ability to provide information technology services to meet our needs 
our operations will depend significantly upon ibm s and our ability to make our servers  software applications and websites available and to protect our data from damage or interruption from human error  computer viruses  intentional acts of vandalism  labor disputes  natural disasters and similar events 
if the cost of ibm hosting and managing certain aspects of our data center information technology infrastructure is more than expected  or if ibm or we are unable to adequately protect our data and information is lost or our ability to deliver our services is interrupted  then our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted 
our operating and financial performance in any given period might not meet the extensive guidance that we have provided to the public 
we provide extensive public guidance on our expected operating and financial results for future periods 
although we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of management s expectations for the future  and is useful to our shareholders and potential shareholders  such guidance is comprised of forward looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements 
our guidance may not always be accurate 
if in the future our operating or financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or if we reduce our guidance for future periods  the market price of our common stock could decline 
our quarterly results of operations might fluctuate due to a variety of factors  including seasonality 
our quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future  depending upon a variety of factors  including shifts in the timing of holiday selling seasons  including valentine s day  easter  halloween  thanksgiving and christmas  and the strategic importance of fourth quarter results 
a significant portion of our revenues and net earnings have been realized during the period from october through december 
in anticipation of increased holiday sales activity  we incur certain significant incremental expenses  including the hiring of a substantial number of temporary employees to supplement our existing workforce 
if  for any reason  we were to realize significantly lower than expected revenues or net earnings during the october through december selling season  our business and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

table of contents we may require external funding sources for operating funds 
we regularly review and evaluate our liquidity and capital needs 
we currently believe that our available cash  cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and cash available under our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to finance our operations and expected capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  as we continue to grow  we might experience peak periods for our cash needs during the course of our fiscal year  and we might need additional external funding to support our operations 
although we believe we would have access to additional debt and or capital market funding if needed  such funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms 
if the cost of such funds is greater than expected  it could adversely affect our expenses and our operating results 
we are exposed to potential risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate controls under section of the sarbanes oxley act of we have evaluated our internal controls in order to allow management to report on  and our registered independent public accounting firm to attest to  our internal controls  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of we have performed the system and process evaluation and testing required in an effort to comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements of section as a result  we have incurred significant additional expenses and a diversion of management s time 
if we are not able to continue to meet the requirements of section in a timely manner or with adequate compliance  we might be required to disclose material weaknesses if they develop or are uncovered and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  such as the sec or the nyse 
any such action could negatively impact the financial market s perception of us and our business 
changes to existing accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our results of operations 
changes to existing accounting rules or regulations may impact our future results of operations 
for example  on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which will require us  starting in the third quarter of fiscal year  to measure and record compensation expense for all employee share based compensation awards using a fair value method 
other new accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future 
future changes to accounting rules or regulations or the questioning of current accounting practices  may adversely affect our results of operations 
changes to estimates related to our property and equipment  or results that are lower than our current estimates at certain store locations  may cause us to incur impairment charges 
we make certain estimates and projections in connection with impairment analyses for certain of our store locations in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we review for impairment all stores for which current cash flows from operations are negative or the construction costs are significantly in excess of the amount originally expected 
impairment results when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows over the life of the lease 
these calculations require us to make a number of estimates and projections of future results  often up to twenty years into the future 
if these estimates or projections change or prove incorrect  we may be required to take impairment charges on certain of these store locations 
if these impairment charges are significant  our results of operations would be adversely affected 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk the interest payable on our credit facility  industrial development bonds and the bond related debt associated with our memphis based distribution facilities is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on existing variable rate debt rose basis points an approximate increase in the associated variable rates as of january   our results from operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
in addition  we have fixed and variable income investments consisting of short term investments classified as cash and cash equivalents  which are also affected by changes in market interest rates 
an increase in interest rates of would have an immaterial effect on the value of these investments 
declines in interest rates would  however  decrease the income derived from these investments 
foreign currency risks we purchase a significant amount of inventory from vendors outside of the us in transactions that are denominated in us dollars 
approximately of our international purchase transactions are in currencies other than the us dollar 
as of january   any currency risks related to these transactions were not significant to us 
a decline in the relative value of the us dollar to other foreign currencies could  however  lead to increased purchasing costs 
as of january   we have retail stores in canada  which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
as necessary  we have utilized day foreign currency contracts to minimize any currency remeasurement risk associated with intercompany assets and liabilities of our canadian subsidiary 
these contracts are accounted for by adjusting the carrying amount of the contract to market and recognizing any gain or loss in selling  general and administrative expenses in each reporting period 
we did not enter into any new foreign currency contracts during fiscal any gain or loss associated with these contracts in prior years was not material to us
