the key to this  in management s view  is to emphasize personalized  quality banking products and services for its customers  to hire and retain excellent  high performing branch and administrative personnel  and to respond quickly to customer demand and growth opportunities 
management also intends to increase columbia s penetration in existing markets  and to expand into new markets through suitable acquisitions and new branch openings

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this form k  are based upon columbia s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates the estimates used  including the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses  impairment of intangible assets  contingencies and litigation 
estimates are based upon historical experience  current economic conditions and other factors that management considers reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates result in judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities when these values are not readily available from other sources as well as assessing and identifying the accounting treatments of commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is established to absorb known and inherent losses attributable to loans and leases outstanding and related off balance sheet commitments 
the adequacy of the allowance is monitored on an ongoing basis and is based on management s evaluation of numerous factors 
these factors include the quality of the current loan portfolio  the trend in the loan portfolio s risk ratings  current economic conditions  loan concentrations  loan growth rates  past due and non performing trends  evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans  historical charge off and recovery experience and other pertinent information 
approximately of columbia s gross loan portfolio is secured by real estate and a significant depreciation in real estate values in oregon and washington would cause management to increase the allowance for loan and lease losses 
during and prior years  columbia capitalized servicing retained mortgage premiums which resulted in recognition of a mortgage servicing asset msa and a corresponding recognition of servicing income 
the msa has been valued on a quarterly basis by a qualified  third party with access and knowledge of current servicing portfolio values in the market place 
the techniques used in valuing the msa incorporate assumptions relative to prevailing conditions in the secondary servicing market 
these assumptions have been dependent upon near term transactions and include prepayment speed forecasts  market discount rates  earning rates  servicing costs  acquisition costs and ancillary income 
a calculated decrease in the value of the msa is recorded as a valuation write down adjustment 
however  actual fair values may differ from the measured valuation due to limitations in available third party market quotations and potential changes in the underlying assumptions 
the mortgage servicing asset has been amortized over the expected life of the outstanding net servicing income 
the expected life of the outstanding net servicing income that is generated from the msa can vary from management s estimates due to interest rate volatility and changing prepayment speeds 
prepayment speeds in excess of management s estimates could negatively impact the recorded value of the msa 
columbia initiated a strategic shift in and discontinued the practice of capitalizing service retained mortgage premiums 
crb mortgage team mortgage team now originates mortgage loans which are sold exclusively on a brokerage basis with the mortgage servicing released 
this means the existing msa balance will not increase as a result of additional mortgage loan activity in which mortgage premiums are retained 
this strategy continued into with a focus on producing quality loans  providing competitive loan products  and selling service released mortgage premiums in the secondary servicing market 
management believes this will reduce interest rate risk associated with the msa 
any future decision to sell the msa will be dependent upon the movement of interest rates 
a rise in interest rates in will likely improve the value of the msa and provide management with the ability to examine sale options 
at december   columbia had approximately million in goodwill as a result of business combinations 
columbia adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
on january  annual and periodic analyses of recorded goodwill for impairment involves  as required by sfas  judgment on the part of management 
neither the initial or annual assessments have identified impairment of goodwill such that the net book value of the reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value

in the pro forma disclosure are not indicative of future amounts 
recently  the financial accounting standards board fasb announced the release of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
the effect of this revision will require columbia to begin recognizing the fair values of stock options granted as compensation cost over the vesting period 
sfas r will take effect for interim periods beginning after june  as permitted by sfas  columbia currently accounts for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while columbia cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were approximately   and  in  and  respectively

table of contents columbia may become party to various legal proceedings 
these matters have a high degree of uncertainty associated with them 
there can be no assurance that the ultimate outcome will not differ materially from columbia s assessment of them 
there can also be no assurance that all matters that may be brought against columbia are known to them at any point in time 
results of operations net interest income for columbia  the primary component of earnings is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loan and investment security portfolios  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and bank borrowings from other sources  such as trust preferred securities 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  spread and margin 
volume refers to the dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
spread refers to the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to total average interest earning assets and is influenced by the relative level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
average balances and average rates earned and paid 
the following table shows average balances and interest income or interest expense  with the resulting average yield or rates by category of earning assets or interest bearing liabilities

table of contents analysis of changes in interest differential

net interest spread in was  in it was and in it was 
the net interest spread for year  decreased basis points over year  due in large part to the effect of falling interest rates lowering yields on earning assets and a rise in deposit costs in the second half of due to rising short term interest rates 
total interest earning assets averaged million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the corresponding periods in and the majority of the growth in earning assets occurred in the loan category 
increases in the loan portfolio are attributed to favorable interest rates  market conditions and the execution of columbia s strategy to provide personal  quality banking products and services  to hire experienced lending and administrative support staff personnel in strategic branch locations and to emphasize marketing strategies 
average loans  which generally carry a higher yield than investment securities and other earning assets  comprised of average earning assets during  compared to in and in during the same periods  average yields on loans were in  in and in average investment securities comprised of average earning assets in  which was down from in and in tax equivalent interest yields on investment securities were for  in and in interest bearing liabilities averaged million for the year ended december   million during the same period in and million during the same period in interest cost  as a percentage of earning assets  decreased to in  compared to in and in the decline in interest cost as a percentage of earning assets resulted from falling interest rates during the previous three years 
deposit rates were near historically low levels during the last few years  but began to gradually rise in the second half of as the fed funds rate was increased and short term treasury yields rose

table of contents provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses represents charges made to earnings to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is maintained at an amount management believes to be sufficient to absorb losses in the loan portfolio 
factors considered in establishing an appropriate allowance include a careful assessment of the financial condition of the borrower  a realistic determination of the value and adequacy of underlying collateral  the condition of the local economy and the condition of the specific industry of the borrower  a comprehensive analysis of the levels and trends of loan categories  and a review of delinquent and classified loans 
when a provision for loan loss is recorded  the amount is based on past charge off experience  a careful analysis of the current portfolio  and an evaluation of economic trends in columbia s market areas 
management will continue to closely monitor the loan quality of new and existing relationships through stringent review and evaluation procedures and by making loan officers accountable for collection efforts 
columbia applies a systematic process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  including both external and internal loan review functions and a quarterly analysis of the adequacy of the allowance 
the quarterly analysis includes determination of specific potential loss factors on individual classified loans  historical potential loss factors derived from actual net charge off experience and trends in non performing loans  and potential loss factors for other loan portfolio risks such as loan concentrations  the condition of the local economy  and the nature and volume of loans 
for the year ended december   the allowance for loan losses totaled million  compared to million at december   and million at december  this represents an increase of between and and an increase of between and the increase in is due in large part to the growth in the loan portfolio during a more detailed review of the loan loss provision and allowance for loan losses is presented in table the recorded values of loans actually removed from the consolidated balance sheets are referred to as charge offs and  after netting out recoveries on previously charged off loans  become net charge offs 
columbia s policy is to charge off loans when  in management s opinion  the loan or a portion thereof is deemed uncollectible  although concerted efforts are made to maximize recovery after the charge off 
for the year ended december   loan charge offs exceeded recoveries by million as compared to and  when loan charge offs exceeded recoveries by million and  respectively 
the decrease in loan losses between and is primarily attributable to a single write down of million that was taken during columbia believes the large write down in was an unusual and infrequent occurrence and loan losses are more reflective of historic levels 
non interest income total non interest income declined from year through year  and increased from year through during the prior three years  non interest income was million in  million in and million in non interest income is primarily comprised of six categories  service charges and fees  mortgage team net revenues  credit card discounts and fees  crb financial services team revenues  net gain on sale or call of investments securities and other non interest income 
each of the categories increased during  except for mortgage team revenues and crb financial services team revenues 
mortgage team net revenues increased  from to  and decreased million from to the decrease in mortgage team net revenues during was due to a significant slow down in loans originated 
the decrease in crb financial services team revenues from to of  was attributable to a volatile market environment and cautious investors  resulting in lower volume and revenue 
service charges and fees were million for the year  an increase of compared to million for the year  and million for the year the growth in service charges and fees were attributable to an increase in overdraft protection charges 
the remainder of the change in non interest income is primarily attributable to improved revenues and growth received from credit card discounts and fees  appraisal fee income and a net gain on the sale of land 
columbia bancorp 
table of contents non interest expense non interest expense consists principally of salaries and benefits  occupancy costs  item and statement processing expenses and other non interest expenses 
a measure of columbia s ability to control non interest expenses is the efficiency ratio 
for the year ended december   the efficiency ratio was  as compared to in and in the efficiency ratio non interest expense divided by net interest income and non interest income reflects an improving trend due to growth in revenue from net interest income and efforts by management to monitor and control overhead expenses 
non interest expense for was million  as compared to million for and million for the changes in non interest expense are primarily the result of an increase in salary expense  occupancy expense and other non interest expenses 
the additional increases relate primarily to costs associated with the investment in new branches  commitment to employee training  continued investment in technology and promotion related expenses 
additionally  costs associated with compliance of sarbanes oxley section sox legislation totaled approximately  during the fourth quarter of columbia expects to incur approximately  during the first quarter of to complete the compliance with sox income taxes the provision for income taxes was million in  million in and million in the provision resulted in effective combined federal and state tax rates of in  in and in the effective tax rates differ from combined estimated statutory rates of principally due to the effects of nontaxable interest income  which is recognized for accounting purposes  but not for tax purposes

table of contents financial condition investments federal funds sold are short term investments that mature on a daily basis 
columbia invests in these instruments to provide for additional earnings on excess available cash balances 
because of their short maturities  the balance of federal funds sold fluctuates dramatically on a day to day basis 
the balance on any one day is influenced by cash demands  customer deposit levels  loan activity and future expected cash flows 
investments in federal funds sold totaled million at december   compared to million at december   and million at december  a year to year comparison shows that columbia s investment securities at december   totaled million  compared to million at december   and million at december  this represents an increase of between and and a decrease of between and the increase in the investment portfolio occurred among available for sale securities in order to replace many of the investments called from the portfolio due to falling interest rates 
for the years ended december  and  no single investment security held by columbia equaled or exceeded of its consolidated shareholders equity 
for the year ended december   columbia had one investment security that totaled of its consolidated shareholders equity 
the investment security is a federal agency backed discount note structured to earn a higher rate of return as compared to the overnight federal funds rate 
the investment security matured on january  on december   investments in federal funds sold an overnight investment were million and investments in restricted stock were million 
the balance of federal funds sold is influenced by cash demands  customer deposit levels  loan activity  and future expected cash flows 
columbia follows a financial accounting principle which requires that investment securities be identified as trading  held to maturity or available for sale 
held to maturity securities are those that columbia has the intent and ability to hold until they mature or are called 
available for sale securities are those that management may sell if liquidity requirements dictate or if alternative investment opportunities arise 
management determines the mix of available for sale and held to maturity investment securities based on the board of director s approved asset liability policy  management s assessment of columbia s need for relative liquidity and other factors 
at december   the investment portfolio  excluding restricted equity securities  consisted of available for sale securities and held to maturity securities 
at december   the portfolio consisted of available for sale securities and held to maturity securities 
at december   columbia s investment portfolio  excluding restricted equity securities  consisted of available for sale securities and held to maturity securities 
at december   columbia s investment portfolio had total net unrealized gains of approximately  this compares to net unrealized gains of approximately  at december  and net unrealized gains of million at december  unrealized gains and losses reflect changes in market conditions and do not represent the amount of actual profits or losses that may be realized 
actual realized gains and losses occur at the time investment securities are sold or called 
at each financial statement date  management assesses each investment to determine if impaired investments are temporarily impaired or if the impairment is other than temporary based upon the positive and negative evidence available 
evidence evaluated includes  but is not limited to  industry analyst reports  credit market conditions and interest rate trends 
a decline in the market value of any security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and the corresponding establishment of a new cost basis for the security

table of contents loans columbia s loan policies and procedures establish the basic guidelines governing its lending operations 
generally  the guidelines address the types of loans that it seeks  target markets  underwriting and collateral requirements  terms  pricing  and compliance with laws and regulations 
all loans or credit lines are subject to approval procedures and amount limitations 
these limitations apply to the borrower s total outstanding indebtedness to crb  including the indebtedness of any guarantor 
the policies are reviewed and approved by the board of directors of crb 
bank officers are charged with loan origination in compliance with underwriting standards overseen by the loan administration department and in conformity with established loan policies 
on an annual basis  the board of directors determines the lending and approval authority of the president  the chief administrative officer and the chief credit officer  who then delegate lending and approval authority to other lending officers 
such delegated authority may include authority related to loans  letters of credit  overdrafts  uncollected funds  and such other authority as determined by the board of directors  the president or chief credit officer within their delegated authority 
the chief credit officer has the authority to approve loans up to an approval limit as set by the board of directors 
all loans above the approval limit of the chief credit officer  and up to a certain limit  are reviewed for approval by the president or chief administrative officer 
loans which exceed this limit are subject to review and approval by the board loan committee 
all loans approved by the board loan committee are reviewed by the full board of directors at regularly scheduled meetings 
columbia s unsecured legal lending limit was million and its real estate secured lending limit was million at december  columbia rarely makes loans for an amount approaching its legal lending limits 
net outstanding loans totaled million at december   representing an increase of million  or compared to million at december  unfunded loan commitments grew to million as of december   representing an increase of million  or over year end columbia s net loan portfolio excludes loans held for sale at december   includes loans secured by real estate  commercial loans  agricultural loans  consumer and other loans  deferred loan fees and reserve for loan loss 
the largest category is concentrated in real estate loans 
this is primarily due to the significant growth of commercial real estate loan activity 
residential mortgage loans usually are temporarily financed on the balance sheet before being sold to the secondary market and are classified as loans held for sale 
some commercial loans are secured by real estate  but are used for purposes other than financing the purchase of real property  such as inventory financing and equipment purchases  where real property serves as collateral for the loan

as interest rates rise these loans will begin to raise above the loan floor  increasing the interest income received on them and improving the yield for the net interest margin 
additionally  of columbia s loan portfolio on december   had a variable interest rate 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense based on an overall assessment of columbia s credit portfolio and on the quality of individual loans within that portfolio 
the reserve is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb possible losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible  based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans and prior loan loss experience 
management charges loans against the reserve when it is determined that the principal or a portion thereof may be uncollectible 
accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions  that collection efforts are doubtful 
also  the collateral position is carefully evaluated when the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of principal and interest is doubtful 
columbia follows guidance from financial accounting standard board s statements and and the interagency policy statement issued by the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec regarding allowance for loan and lease losses methodologies 
on a quarterly basis  management determines the appropriate allowance for loan and lease losses using the following three methodologies loss allocation to groups of loans by internal risk grade loss allocation by loan type loss allocation by historical loss percentage management s determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based on an assessment of the risk in the portfolio given the conditions at the time 
this assessment consists of certain loans and leases being columbia bancorp 
table of contents evaluated on an individual basis  as well as all loans being categorized based on common credit risk attributes and as a group 
the adequacy of the allowance is monitored on an ongoing basis and is based on management s evaluation of numerous factors 
these factors include the quality of the current loan portfolio  the trend in the loan portfolio s risk ratings  current economic conditions  loan concentrations  loan growth rates  past due and non performing trends  evaluations of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans  historical charge off and recovery experience and other pertinent information 
the following table shows columbia s loan loss experience for the periods indicated

the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses should be measured in the context of several key ratios the ratio of the reserve to total outstanding loans  the ratio of total non performing loans to total loans  and  the ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding 
since  columbia s ratio of the reserve for loan losses to total loans has ranged from to 
the amounts provided by these ratios have been sufficient to fund columbia s charge offs and to provide for potential losses as the loan portfolio has grown 
columbia s historical ratio of net charge offs to average outstanding loans illustrates its moderate loan charge off and recovery experience 
from december  through december   net charge offs ranged from to of average loans 
management believes columbia s loan underwriting policies and its loan officers knowledge of their customers are significant contributors to columbia s ability to mitigate loan losses 
during the year ended december   columbia recognized million in loan charge offs and  in recoveries for a net charge off of million 
the decrease in loan charge offs for  as compared to  is primarily attributable to a write down of a single real estate secured loan for million in management believes the write down in was an unusual and infrequent occurrence 
columbia bancorp

further  management may place loans that are not contractually past due or that are deemed fully collateralized on non accrual status to promote better oversight and review of loan arrangements 
loans on non accrual status at december   totaled approximately million compared to million at december   and  at december  the increase in nonaccrual loans is attributable to a single commercial real estate secured loan for million 
this loan was originated over two years ago to fund a hotel  and the property has failed to reach projected occupancy levels 
columbia deems this loan to be fully collectible at this time due to a combination of the estimated collateral value and the recognized ability of the guarantors to repay the principal balance in full 
at this time  columbia is seeking payment from the guarantors 
if an agreement can not be reached with the guarantors  columbia will pursue its rights through a legal course of action 
management has adopted procedures to identify and monitor loans that have had their original terms restructured to accommodate borrowers financial needs 
loan revisions and modifications are provided to meet the credit needs of borrowers in weakened financial condition and to enhance ultimate collection 
as of december   loans that had been classified as restructured were insignificant and were performing in accordance with their restructured terms 
however  management continues to monitor restructured loans for any changes or deterioration in performance

interest bearing demand accounts increased million  or  and time deposits with balances in excess of  accounts increased million  or  from december  to the increase in time deposits with balances in excess of  accounts is attributed primarily to an increase in brokered or wholesale certificates of deposit and public certificates of deposit with balances greater than  overall  deposits grew due to a combination of competitive pricing strategies  increased marketing and an emphasis on a sales culture within the branches

during  columbia initiated the process to acquire wholesale deposits deposits obtained outside the retail branch network similar to brokered certificates of deposit through a process whereby columbia posts rates on a proprietary network that solicits certificates of deposits from other financial institutions 
this new source of funding has contributed million as of december   with maturities ranging from days to years 
for regulatory purposes these are classified as either brokered certificates of deposit or public certificates of deposit depending on their source 
as of december   columbia had acquired approximately million in brokered and wholesale certificates of deposit  in order to meet current and future loan growth 
during the second half of  columbia saw an increase in deposit gathering efforts at the branch level and began to decrease its origination of brokered certificates of deposit and wholesale deposits

table of contents trust preferred securities in december  columbia issued million in unsecured subordinated debentures to its wholly owned subsidiary  columbia bancorp trust i trust  which has since been deconsolidated in accordance with fin r 
the interest payments on the subordinated debentures are intended to pass through the trust to the beneficial owners of the trust  in the form of trust preferred securities 
the subordinated debentures and trust preferred securities have identical rate  terms and conditions variable rates tied to the day libor with a margin of and year maturities 
the trust preferred securities are considered tier i capital for regulatory purposes 
management entered into this transaction in order to repurchase  shares of common stock at a price of per share in november and maintain regulatory capital within the well capitalized category as defined by the bank s regulators 
as previously discussed  columbia deconsolidated the trust as of march  as a result  the junior subordinated debentures issued by columbia to the issuer trusts  totaling million  are reflected on columbia s consolidated balance sheet at december   under the caption junior subordinated debentures 
columbia also recognized its  investment in the trust  which is recorded among other assets in its consolidated balance sheet at december  shareholders equity and regulatory capital shareholders equity increased million during shareholders equity at december   was million compared to million at december  this increase reflects net income and other comprehensive income of million and  in exercised stock options 
these additions to equity were partially offset by cash dividends paid or declared of million 
columbia s board of directors authorized a program to repurchase shares of columbia s common stock valued at up to million  in with an expiration date of june  in may  columbia adopted a new plan  set to expire june   to allow the repurchase of up to million in common stock 
columbia has authorized the repurchase programs because the board of directors believes in the long term value of columbia s stock  and that such repurchase constitutes a sound investment use of columbia s funds 
the repurchase plan will be conducted in the open market pursuant to the securities exchange act rule b at the sole discretion of management

table of contents liquidity and capital resources columbia s management has adopted policies to help maintain liquidity in order to respond to changes in the financial environment and ensure sufficient funds are available to meet its anticipated cash demands  which ordinarily come from customers needs for borrowing and deposit withdrawals 
generally  columbia s major sources of liquidity are customer deposits  sales and maturities of investment securities  and net cash provided by operating activities 
from time to time  columbia also may draw upon credit lines with the federal home loan bank of seattle and correspondent banks  as well as brokered certificates of deposit and other wholesale borrowings 
scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and unscheduled loan prepayments are not as stable because they are influenced by general interest rate levels  competing interest rates available on other investments  market competition  economic conditions and other factors 
liquid asset balances include cash  amounts due from other banks  federal funds sold  unpledged securities available for sale and securities held to maturity with maturities occurring within three months 
at december   these liquid assets totaled million or of total assets  as compared to million or of total assets at december  the total liquid assets of million or of total assets as of december   compare to million or of total assets at december  as of december  and  unused and available lines of credit totaled million and million  respectively 
during the first half of  net loan growth along with projected future loan growth exceeded expected deposit growth for the year 
because of this  columbia increased its usage of other borrowings and brokered certificates of deposit by million and million  respectively 
columbia also carried a balance of million in other wholesale certificates of deposits as of december  additionally  during the last half of  columbia began a new deposit gathering campaign and sold or participated million in loans  which improved liquidity 
federal funds sold increased by million from december   to december  management will continue to rely on retail branch deposit growth  brokered and wholesale certificates of deposit and other funding sources  as necessitated to maintain acceptable levels of liquidity 
however  during the last half of and into the first half of  management intends to decrease its use of brokered and wholesale certificates of deposits  believing retail branch deposit gathering efforts will be sufficient for funding loan demand 
the analysis of liquidity also includes a review of the changes that appear in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended december  the statement of cash flows includes operating  investing  and financing categories 
operating activities include net income of million  which is adjusted for non cash items and increases or decreases in cash due to changes in certain assets and liabilities 
the net change from operating activities from to was a decrease of million  mostly attributed to the decrease in the process from the sale of mortgage loans held for sale 
investing activities consist primarily of both proceeds from and purchases of securities and the impact of the net growth in loans 
during  investing activities increased million  most notably in the form of net growth in loans of million 
financing activities present the cash flows associated with deposit accounts and reflect various transactions with shareholders 
financing activities increased during by million  mostly in the area of deposit growth which grew million over at december   columbia had outstanding unfunded lending commitments of million 
nearly all of these commitments represented unused portions of commitments to extend credit to businesses  credit lines available to consumers under credit card and other arrangements and commercial and standby letters of credit 
many of these credit lines will not be fully drawn upon and  accordingly  the aggregate commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
management believes that columbia s sources of liquidity  million in liquid assets  million in unused lines of credits and the use of brokered or wholesale certificates of deposits  are sufficient to meet likely calls on outstanding commitments  although there can be no assurance in this regard 
additionally  management monitors liquidity on a daily  weekly  monthly and quarterly basis  depending on the need to ensure liquidity is available to meet its anticipated cash demands

crb uses a qualified independent third party to value the mortgage service asset msa in accordance with statement of accounting standard sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
a qualified independent third party measures the msa using information obtained from knowledge of the secondary servicing market and assesses current transaction values between willing parties 
the techniques used in valuing the msa incorporate assumptions relative to prevailing conditions in the secondary servicing market 
the assumptions used for valuing the msa are gathered from near term transactions and include prepayment speed forecasts  market discount rates  earning rates  servicing costs  acquisition costs and ancillary income 
the mortgage servicing asset is amortized in proportion to and over the period of the estimated life of the net servicing income 
columbia bancorp 
table of contents in  the mortgage team recorded a loss before income taxes of  a loss for the year ended december   was  and a loss of million was recognized in the mortgage team s earnings in and were negatively impacted by higher mortgage servicing asset amortization and valuation write downs 
this was caused by the prevailing low mortgage interest rate environment present during the last three years  which motivated a record number of borrowers to refinance their mortgage loans 
because borrowers refinance their mortgage loans or pay them off early  amortization expense must be adjusted to properly match the estimated period of the outstanding net servicing income 
in addition  the mortgage servicing asset is periodically valued based on a fair value assessment as measured by a qualified and independent entity with access and knowledge of current servicing portfolio transaction values 
if net valuation write downs of the mortgage servicing asset are assessed  there is a corresponding charge to the income statement 
during  columbia had no valuation write downs 
during and  columbia assessed net valuation write downs in the amounts of  and million  respectively 
the contributing factors to mortgage team s loss in were lower mortgage originations  overhead expenses remaining constant while experiencing a drop in production and msa amortization expense in excess of loan servicing revenue 
inflation at this time  management does not consider the long term effects of inflation  as measured by the consumer price index  will be material to columbia s financial position and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  columbia utilizes financial instruments with off balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of its customers  including loan commitments to extend credit  commercial letters of credit  standby letters of credit  unused portions of visa credit cards  and commitments to fund mortgage loans 
the increase in off balance sheet items has occurred during the last three years as a result of growth in the loan portfolio 
the table below sets forth the distribution of columbia s contingent liabilities by off balance sheet type 
commitments to extend credit increased primarily due to growth and expansion of commercial real estate construction lending from columbia s central oregon branches

derivative management prior to  the crb mortgage team would accept loan applications that often did not fund and close for to days 
during this time  the loan had been considered to be in the open mortgage pipeline 
once the loan was either funded or closed  it was then removed from the open mortgage pipeline 
the loans that comprise the open mortgage pipeline were price locked to the borrower  therefore  interest rate fluctuations could have resulted in gains and or losses from the sale of loans on the secondary market 
the risk of price fluctuations to the open mortgage pipeline was managed by the use of derivative forward contracts and put options 
the underlying securities of the derivatives were mortgage backed securities  which generally corresponded with the composition of the open mortgage pipeline 
the structure of the derivatives was intended to serve as a hedge against the impact of rising and falling interest rates 
the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in earnings in the same period  as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
during the fourth quarter of  the mortgage team discontinued the practice of using derivative instruments to hedge the open mortgage pipeline 
therefore  as of december   there were no outstanding derivatives in use for managing interest rate risk in the mortgage pipeline 
the mortgage team instituted a new practice in of locking mortgage loan applicants using a method known as best efforts 
the method of selling best efforts involves the sale of mortgage loans to third party investors at a committed loan rate and loan amount within a predetermined time period without risk of a penalty for failure to deliver the locked mortgage loans 
the benefit to columbia is that it shifts the interest rate risk to the investor and eliminates the need to use derivatives for managing interest rate risk  but it does have the effect of lowering the amount of service release mortgage premium income 
management determined it is in columbia s best interest to accept the lower income for a reduction in interest rate risk exposure 
this strategy will be evaluated on a periodic basis and may change as information becomes available and or personnel are hired with specialized skills to effectively manage the interest rate risk exposure from secondary marketing activity 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued statement no

sfas no 
r requires stock based transactions to be recognized as compensation expense in the income statement based on their fair values at the date of grant 
the fair value should be estimated using option pricing models such as the black scholes model or a binomial model 
this statement is effective for interim periods beginning after june  at this time  columbia does not believe the future impact on earnings to be a great extent different than what has historically been reported as the pro forma effect to income in note the impact to operating and financing cash flows is not considered to be material to the financial statements

table of contents in december  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer  which addresses the accounting for certain loans acquired in a transfer when it is probable  at acquisition  that the investor will be unable to collect all contractually required payments receivable 
sop is to be applied prospectively  effective for loans acquired in years beginning after december  sop requires acquired loans with evidence of credit deterioration to be recorded at fair value and prohibits recording any valuation allowance related to such loans at the time of purchase 
this sop limits the yield that may be accreted on such loans to the excess of the investor s estimated cash flows over its initial investment in the loan 
the excess of contractual cash flows over cash flows expected to be collected is not to be recognized as an adjustment of yield 
subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected are recognized prospectively through adjustment of the loan s yield over its remaining life 
decreases in cash flows expected to be collected are recognized as impairment 
loans carried at fair value  mortgage loans held for sale  and loans to borrowers in good standing under revolving credit agreements are excluded from the scope of sop in november  the eitf reached a consensus that certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures should be required for debt and marketable equity securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity under sfas no 
and  that are impaired at the balance sheet date  but for which an other than temporary impairment has not been recognized 
this eitf consensus is effective for fiscal years ending after december  accordingly  columbia has adopted the provisions of this consensus as of december  and the result did not have an impact on columbia s statement of financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards regarding classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires financial instruments within the scope of this statement to be classified as liabilities 
many of these financial instruments were previously classified as equity 
this statement became effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and was otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after september  for financial instruments created before the issuance date of this statement and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption  transition was achieved by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle by initially measuring the financial instruments at fair value 
application of the provisions of this statement did not have a material impact on columbia s consolidated financial statements

this statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
application of the provisions of this statement did not have a material impact on columbia s consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  and requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
this interpretation explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
in december  the fasb made revisions and delayed implementation of certain provisions of fin by issuing fin r 
as a public entity that is not a small business issuer  columbia was required to apply fin r to all unconsolidated variable interest entities no later than march   with the exception of unconsolidated special purpose entities  which had an implementation deadline of december  special purpose entities for this provision are expected to include entities whose activities are primarily related to securitizations or other forms of asset backed financings or single lessee leasing arrangements 
as a result of adoption of fin r  columbia no longer consolidates columbia bancorp trust i within its financial statements and recognizes million as junior subordinated debentures due to the trust effective march  management does not anticipate adoption of the interpretation will have further effects on the financial condition or results of operations of columbia 
columbia bancorp 
table of contents factors that may affect future results of operations columbia s past experience may not be indicative of future performance  and as noted elsewhere in this report  management has included forward looking statements about its business  plans and prospects that are subject to change 
in addition to the other risks or uncertainties contained in this report  the following risks may affect its operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
if any of these risks occur  either alone or in combination with other factors  columbia s business  financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 
moreover  readers should note that this is not an exhaustive list of the risks columbia faces  some risks are unknown or not quantifiable  and other risks that management currently perceives as immaterial may ultimately prove more significant than expected 
statements about plans  predictions or expectations should not be construed to be assurances of performance or promises to take a given course of action 
adequacy of loan loss allowance 
columbia has established a reserve for probable losses management expects in connection with loans in its credit portfolio 
this allowance reflects management s estimates of the collectibility of certain identified loans  as well as an overall risk assessment of total loans outstanding 
management s determination of the amount of loan loss allowance is highly subjective  although management personnel apply criteria such as risk ratings and historical loss rates  these factors may not be adequate predictors of future loan performance 
accordingly  management cannot offer assurances that these estimates ultimately will prove correct or that the loan loss allowance will be sufficient to protect against losses that ultimately may occur 
if columbia s loan loss allowance proves to be inadequate  it may suffer unexpected charges to income  which would adversely impact its results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  bank regulators frequently monitor banks loan loss allowances  and if regulators were to determine that the allowance is inadequate  they may require columbia to increase the allowance  which also would adversely impact its revenues and financial condition 
valuation of the mortgage servicing asset 
columbia includes on its balance sheet an asset that is largely influenced by the net present value of expected net servicing income  which was created from mortgages originated and sold in the secondary market 
the value of this asset reflects certain assumptions about net service fee income  servicing costs  prospective interest rates  real estate markets  rates of debt retirement  and other factors relating to the length of time during which those revenues can be expected to continue 
the estimates and assumptions used in valuing the mortgage servicing asset are determined by a qualified independent third party 
the qualified independent third party measures the value of the mortgage servicing asset based on assumptions influenced by current market conditions and near term transactions  which are likely to cause the value of the mortgage servicing asset to fluctuate 
therefore  potential valuation adjustments  which are charged against or credited to current income  may have a material adverse impact on revenues for the periods in which adjustments occur 
growth and management 
columbia s financial performance and profitability will depend on its ability to manage recent and possible future growth 
although management believes that it has substantially integrated the business and operations of past acquisitions  there can be no assurance that unforeseen issues relating to the acquisitions will not adversely affect us 
in addition  any future acquisitions and continued growth may present operating and other problems that could have an adverse effect on columbia s business  financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that columbia will be able to execute its growth strategy or maintain the level of profitability that it has experienced in the past 
changes in market interest rates 
columbia s earnings are impacted by changing interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the demand for new loans  the credit profile of existing loans  the rates received on loans and securities  and rates paid on deposits and borrowings 
the relationship between the rates received on loans and securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings is known as the net interest spread 
given columbia s current volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets  net interest spread could be expected to increase during times when interest rates rise in a parallel shift along the yield curve and  conversely  to decline during times of similar falling interest rates 
approximately of columbia s total loans are on or under rate floors that reprice daily with the prime rate  which will take an approximately basis point rise in the prime rate before these variable interest rate loans float with market rates above the contractual rate floor 
exposure to interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the re pricing frequency of crb s rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities over any given period 
although management believes the current level of interest rate sensitivity is reasonable  significant fluctuations in interest rates could potentially have an adverse affect on columbia s business  financial condition and results of operations 
columbia bancorp 
table of contents geographic concentration 
substantially all of columbia s business is derived from a nine county area in central  north central and northeastern oregon and south central washington 
these areas are not extensively populated  and rely primarily upon the agricultural  electrical power generation and transportation markets for their economic success 
while management has planned columbia s expansion strategy in part as a means to diversify the geographic concentration of its business  columbia s business is and will remain sensitive to economic factors that relate to these industries and local and regional business conditions 
as a result  local or regional economic downturns  or downturns that disproportionately affect one or more of the key industries in regions served by columbia  may have a more pronounced effect upon its business than they might on an institution that is less geographically concentrated 
the extent of the future impact of these events on economic and business conditions cannot be predicted  however  prolonged or acute fluctuations could have a material and adverse impact upon columbia s results of operation and financial condition 
regulation 
columbia is subject to government regulation that could limit or restrict its activities  which in turn could adversely impact its operations 
the financial services industry is regulated extensively 
federal and state regulation is designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers  as well as columbia s shareholders 
these regulations can sometimes impose significant limitations on columbia s operations 
in addition  these regulations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time 
significant new laws or changes in existing laws or repeal of existing laws may cause columbia s results to differ materially 
further  federal monetary policy  particularly as implemented through the federal reserve system  can significantly affect credit availability 
federal legislation such as sarbanes oxley can dramatically shift resources and costs to ensure adequate compliance 
competition 
competition may adversely affect columbia s performance 
the financial services business in columbia s market areas is highly competitive 
it is becoming increasingly competitive due to changes in regulation  technological advances  and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers 
columbia faces competition both in attracting deposits and in originating loans 
columbia competes for loans principally through the pricing of interest rates and loan fees and the efficiency and quality of services 
increasing levels of competition in the banking and financial services industries may reduce columbia s market share or cause the prices charged for its services to fall 
columbia s results may differ in future periods depending upon the nature or level of competition 
credit risk 
a source of risk arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained if a significant number of columbia s borrowers  guarantors and related parties fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans 
columbia has adopted underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and credit policies  including the establishment and review of the allowance for credit losses  which management believes are appropriate to minimize this risk by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance  tracking loan performance and diversifying its credit portfolio 
these policies and procedures  however  may not prevent unexpected losses that could materially affect columbia s results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk management in the banking industry  a major risk involves changing interest rates  which can have a significant impact on columbia s profitability 
columbia manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within the guidelines established by its asset liability committee alco 
alco has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with asset liability management policies  including interest rate risk exposure  capital position  liquidity management and the investment portfolio 
reports prepared by alco are provided to the board of directors on a regular basis 
asset liability management simulation models are used to measure interest rate risk 
the models quantify interest rate risk through simulating forecasted net interest income and economic value of equity over a month forward looking time horizon under various rate scenarios 
the economic value of equity is defined as the difference between the market value of current assets less the market value of liabilities 
by measuring the change in the present value of equity under different rate scenarios  management is able to identify interest rate risk that may not be evident in simulating changes in the forecasted net interest income 
columbia bancorp 
table of contents table below shows the simulated percentage change in forecasted net interest income and the economic value of equity based on changes in the interest rate environment 
the change in interest rates assumes an immediate  parallel and sustained shift in the base interest rate forecast 
through these simulations  management estimates the impact on net interest income and present value of equity based on a and basis point upward and downward gradual change of market interest rates over a one year period 
the analysis did not allow rates to fall below zero 
table percent change percent change in net interest in present value change in interest rates income of equity basis points basis points basis points basis points as illustrated in the above table  columbia s balance sheet is currently asset sensitive  meaning that interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities in a given period 
therefore  according to the model  net interest income should increase slightly when rates increase and shrink somewhat when rates fall in an interest rate shift that is parallel across all terms of the yield curve 
this is primarily a result of the concentration of variable rate and short term commercial loans in columbia s portfolio 
the simulation model does not take into account future management actions that could be undertaken  should a change occur in actual market interest rates 
also  certain assumptions underlie modeling simulation results and these assumptions may have significant impact on the results 
these include assumptions regarding the level of interest rates and balance changes of deposit products that do not have stated maturities 
these assumptions have been developed through a combination of industry standards and historical pricing behavior and modeled for future expectations 
the model also includes assumptions about changes in the composition or mix of the balance sheet 
the results derived from the simulation model could vary significantly due to external factors such as changes in prepayment assumptions  early withdrawals of deposits and unforeseen competitive factors 
mortgage servicing asset the crb mortgage team has recorded a mortgage servicing asset msa that contains risk due to changes in loan prepayments 
the value of the msa will likely decline when interest rates fall due to an increase in loan prepayments 
the msa is measured on a quarterly basis by a qualified independent entity with access and knowledge of current servicing transaction values between willing parties 
the techniques used in valuing the msa incorporate assumptions relative to prevailing conditions in the secondary servicing market 
the assumptions used for valuing the msa are gathered from near term transactions and include prepayment speed forecasts  market discount rates  earning rates  servicing costs  acquisition costs and ancillary income 
a decrease in the value of the msa is recorded as a valuation write down adjustment 
however  actual fair values may differ from the measured valuation due to limitations in available third party market quotations and assumptions 
the value of the mortgage servicing asset is interest rate sensitive and may require quarterly valuation adjustments 
if mortgage rates were to increase in  management would expect the mortgage servicing asset value to stabilize and may in some instances be increased 
in this instance  the monthly mortgage servicing asset amortization expense would be adjusted to meet the expected remaining life of the outstanding net servicing income
