levco specializes in managing equity portfolios for institutional and individual investors 
levco offers long only equity strategies and a range of alternative investment products and other more specialized investment programs 
most clients are based in the united states  though a significant portion of investors in the alternative investment products are located outside the united states 
levco acts as the managing general partner of a number of investment partnerships and also acts as an adviser to private investment vehicles organized outside the united states 
with respect to accounts managed pursuant to its long only equity strategies  levco generally receives advisory fees based on a percentage of the market value of assets under management  including market appreciation or depreciation and client contributions and withdrawals 
in some cases  levco receives performance based fees from accounts pursuing long only equity strategies 
with respect to private investment vehicles and separate accounts managed pursuant to similar strategies  levco is generally entitled to receive both a fixed management fee based on a percentage of the assets under management and a share of net profits 
at december   assets under management at levco were billion  compared to billion a year earlier 
following is a comparison of levco s assets under management as defined by product and client type at december  in millions long only accounts institutional accounts    sub advisory accounts    non institutional accounts    wrap fee accounts    total long only    alternative strategies event driven accounts    long short accounts short biased accounts other private investment funds total alternative strategies    total    levco also has a wholly owned broker dealer subsidiary that clears through bear stearns on a fully disclosed basis 
generally  the customers of the broker dealer subsidiary are advisory clients of levco  and the trades executed through the broker dealer are generally placed by levco in its capacity as investment adviser 
the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations is based on the consolidated statements of financial condition at december  and  and the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and of bkf capital group  inc and subsidiaries which are included elsewhere herein and should be read in conjunction with such financial statements 
it should be noted that certain affiliated investment partnerships in which bkf may be deemed to have a controlling interest have been consolidated 
the number and identity of the partnerships being consolidated may change over time as the percentage interest held by bkf and its affiliates in affiliated investment partnerships changes 
these partnerships and the related minority interests have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements for the annual periods ended december   and the consolidation of the partnerships does not impact bkf s equity or net income 
certain statements under this caption management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations constitute forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of see special note regarding forward looking statements 
results of operations year ended december  as compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues for were million  reflecting an increase of from million in revenues in this increase was primarily attributable to i a increase in asset based management fees from million in to million in and ii a increase in incentive fees and allocations from million to million 
the increase in asset based management fees was generated by the growth in average assets under management of the event driven and long short equity strategies 
these strategies experienced both positive performance and net inflows in and in  incentive fees and allocations generated by the largest long short alternative strategy and certain long only accounts increased  while incentive fees and allocations from accounts following event driven strategies decreased 
in addition  the increase from to was partly driven by the reversal in of an accrual made with respect to an investment vehicle following a short biased investment strategy that had a june  fiscal year end 
frank rango  one of the two senior portfolio managers for the event driven strategies  has announced his intention to step down from such position at the conclusion of henry levin will continue as the sole senior portfolio manager for the group 
henry levin will continue to be supported by four other portfolio managers for the event driven strategies and two portfolio managers focused on investments in distressed debt 
the change in responsibilities for mr 
rango may impact the ability of levco to retain and attract clients with respect to its event driven strategies and may impact the revenues generated by the event driven accounts 
the event driven accounts generated of the company s total fees in net commission income generated by the broker dealer business fell to million in from million in  primarily as the result of a decrease in trading volume and an increase in the charges payable to the clearing broker following the retention of bear stearns for such services in may the retention of bear stearns was precipitated by the sale by ubs of its affiliated clearing subsidiary  correspondent services corporation

the number of awards to be granted was determined based on the value of bkf stock at the time of the compensation committee meeting held in december  but the awards were made in march and had a value of million as of the march  grant date  reflecting a significant increase in the stock price during the intervening period 
the expense associated with such awards will be amortized over the period from the grant date through december  investments made with respect to strategies that have not yet reached critical mass and that are reflected in compensation expense increased to million in  as compared to million in the primary new investment in was in a small cap value strategy  while the fund of funds offering was no longer included in this category in  as compensation by members of this group with respect to marketing activities offset losses from the strategy

bkf has not issued any options since december  and all options granted have vested  all expenses relating to equity awards relate to grants of restricted stock units and restricted stock

in december  the compensation committee of the board of directors  taking into consideration market and business conditions relating to the long only strategies  determined to allow bonus payments partly in the form of equity awards to be granted in in excess of those that would have been permitted pursuant to the compensation guidelines established in with regard to long only products

in  bkf recorded a million loss related to a lease amendment that was entered into in october under the amendment  bkf relinquished space and reduced its rent expense by approximately million over the remaining term of the lease 
the expense accrual was calculated based on the net present value of the payments representing the difference between the amounts that bkf was obligated for on the space it relinquished and the amounts the landlord will receive from the tenant succeeding bkf in the relinquished space 
other operating expenses of bkf for were million  reflecting a decrease of from million in this decrease primarily reflected i a decrease in portfolio management and trading system costs which bear a correlation to the number of accounts managed in wrap fee programs and ii the reversal of an accrual made with respect to payments to third party marketers as the result of the reversal of accrued incentive fees with regard to short biased products  which were partly offset by increased insurance premiums for directors and officers errors and omissions coverage

liquidity and capital resources bkf s current assets as of december  consist primarily of cash  us treasury bills  advisory fees receivable and marketable equity securities 
while bkf s daily business operations are not generally capital intensive  bkf utilizes capital to develop and seed new investment products 
the development of new products is an important element in bkf s business plan  and such seed capital investments may require substantial financial resources 
due to its relatively small size  bkf may consider a number of options to obtain such seed capital 
bkf has historically met its cash and liquidity needs through cash generated by operating activities 
at december   bkf had cash  cash equivalents and us treasury bills of million  as compared to million at december  this increase primarily reflects the collection of fees and receivables during and the annual withdrawal of general partner incentive allocations from affiliated investment partnerships  which was partly offset by the payment of dividends  the purchases of fixed assets and the investment of capital in affiliated investment partnerships 
the increase in investment advisory and incentive fees receivable from million at december  to million at december  primarily reflects the accrual of incentive fees which are primarily earned as of the conclusion of the calendar year  which was partly offset by the receipt in of incentive fees earned in the increase in investments in securities to million at december  from million at december   primarily reflects an additional investment in an affiliated non us private investment vehicle 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets to million at december  from million at december  primarily reflects a tax receivable and the subscription in advance for interests in an unaffiliated investment fund 
the decrease in deferred tax assets to million in from million in is primarily attributable to the delivery of shares of stock underlying restricted stock unit awards and the exercise of stock options for which deferred tax assets were set up in the year the awards and options vested 
the increase in investments in securities from consolidated affiliated partnerships to million at december  from million at december   and the decrease in due from broker from consolidated affiliated partnerships from million at december  to  at december  reflects the numbers and size of the funds consolidated 
accrued expenses were million at december   as compared to million at december  the largest component of such expenses is the accrual for third party marketing fees 
expenses accrued during were offset primarily by the payment of accrued third party marketing fees 
accrued bonuses were million at december   as compared to million at december   reflecting the payment of bonuses and the accrual for bonuses 
the increase in accrued incentive compensation to million at december  from million at december  reflects the vesting of equity awards  which was partly offset by the delivery of the common stock underlying equity awards and the forfeiture of such awards by departing employees 
the decrease in accrued lease amendment expenses to million at december  from million at december  reflects payments made pursuant to the lease amendment under which space was surrendered 
based upon bkf s current level of operations and anticipated growth  bkf expects that cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to finance its working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
bkf s business is not seasonal 
except for the lease commitments and related expenditures described below  bkf has no material commitments for capital expenditures 
the company has office space obligations that require monthly payments plus escalations through september off balance sheet risk levco gp serves as the managing general partner for several affiliated investment partnerships which trade primarily in equity securities or  in the case of one partnership  in distressed corporate debt 
as of december   total partners capital in these partnerships was approximately million 
as of december   the sum total of levco gp s capital accounts in the affiliated investment partnerships was approximately million 
the financial condition and results of operations of certain of these affiliated investment partnerships are not included in bkf s consolidated statements of financial condition except to the extent of levco gp s equity ownership 
levco gp has not guaranteed any of the affiliated investment partnerships obligations  nor does it have any contractual commitments associated with them 
contractual obligations as of december   the company s contractual obligations  including payments due by period  are as follows in thousands payments due by period total thereafter operating leases      accrued lease loss amendment     total contractual obligations      operating lease uk executed february total contractual obligations  subsequent to december       critical accounting policies revenue recognition and related expenses with respect to incentive fees and allocations  bkf has elected to accrue income on a quarterly basis  though such fees and allocations are determined and billed or allocated at the end of the applicable measurement period 
such accruals  as well as related compensation and third party referral fees  may be reversed as the result of subsequent investment performance prior to the conclusion of the applicable contract year or investor withdrawal 
alternatively  bkf could have adopted a policy of not recognizing such fees or allocations until the respective payments are fixed at the end of the performance measurement period 
since most incentives fees or allocations are determined as of the end of the calendar year  the adoption of a revenue recognition policy that defers recognition of incentive fees or allocations and associated expenses could result in much lower levels of income  and associated compensation expenses  for periods prior to the fourth quarter 
bkf s annual financial results would not be materially affected  as most of the performance measurement periods conclude on december purchase price allocation in order to account for the acquisition of levco by bkf in utilizing the purchase method of accounting  levco s cost in excess of net assets was reflected in the following intangible items goodwill  employment contracts for key personnel and investment advisory contracts 
the total value of these intangibles at the time of the acquisition was million 
bkf determined that of that amount was attributable to goodwill  to the employment contracts and to the investment contracts 
bkf amortizes the value of the investment contracts over a ten year period  and amortized the employment contracts  which have all expired  over their respective terms 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  commencing in  the net carrying value of the goodwill of million at december   ceased to be amortized 
goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test 
investments in affiliated investment partnerships levco gp serves as the managing general partner for several affiliated investment partnerships which are not consolidated with bkf 
these general partnerships are periodically assessed to determine whether the underlying assets and liabilities should be consolidated 
see item off balance sheet risk 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk since bkf s revenues are largely driven by the market value of levco s assets under management  these revenues are exposed to fluctuations in the equity markets 
management fees for most accounts are determined based on the market value of the account on the last day of the quarter with respect to which the investment advisory fee is charged  so any significant increases or decreases in market value occurring on or shortly before the last day of a quarter may materially impact revenues for the quarter 
furthermore  since levco manages most of its assets in a large cap value style  a general decline in the performance of value stocks could have an adverse impact on levco s revenues 
similarly  a lack of opportunity to implement  or a failure to successfully implement  levco s event driven strategies  could reduce performance based incentive fees and allocations and thereby negatively impact bkf s revenues 
in addition  as of december  and  bkf had invested million and million  respectively  in seed capital for long only equity products  which investments could be similarly impacted by a decline in the performance of value stocks  and million and million excluding accrued incentive allocations  respectively  in proprietary alternative investment strategies  which are also exposed to market fluctuations
