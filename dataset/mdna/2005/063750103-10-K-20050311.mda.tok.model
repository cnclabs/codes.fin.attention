item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview from november  until october   bank mutual corporation was an ots chartered united states corporation which became the mid tier holding company in the regulatory restructuring of mutual savings bank into mutual holding company form 
until october   bank mutual bancorp  mhc the mhc  a us chartered mutual holding company of which mutual savings bank s depositors held all of the voting and membership rights  owned of bank mutual corporation s outstanding common stock 
on november   bank mutual corporation also acquired first northern capital corp  the parent of first northern savings bank 
on march   mutual savings bank and first northern savings bank combined to form a single ots chartered savings bank subsidiary of bank mutual corporation called bank mutual herein called the bank 
on october   bank mutual corporation completed a conversion and reorganization from a mutual holding company form  established a new wisconsin chartered bank mutual corporation and  in effect  sold the mhc s interest in bank mutual corporation to the public 
existing bank mutual corporation shareholders exchanged each existing share for shares of the new bank mutual corporation shares 
the total number of shares issued or exchanged in the offering was approximately  shares 
all share and per share numbers in this discussion have been adjusted to reflect the full conversion transaction and related share exchange 
as used herein  the company and bank mutual corporation refer to bank mutual corporation both before and after the full conversion transaction  unless the context requires otherwise 
significant accounting policies there are a number of accounting policies that we established which require us to use our judgment 
some of the more significant policies are as follows establishing the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires the use of our judgment 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and is based on the size and current risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  an assessment of individual problem loans and actual loss experience  current economic events in specific industries and geographical areas  including unemployment levels  and other pertinent factors  including regulatory guidance and general economic conditions 
determination of the allowance is inherently subjective as it requires significant estimates  including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
loan losses are charged off against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned  as well as other pertinent factors 
evaluations are conducted at least quarterly and more often if deemed necessary 
if we misjudge a major component and experience a loss  it will likely affect our earnings 
developments affecting loans can also cause the allowance to vary significantly between quarters 
we consistently challenge ourselves in the review of the risk components to identify any changes in trends and their cause 
another valuation that requires our judgment relates to mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing rights are recorded as an asset when loans are sold with servicing rights retained 
the total cost of loans sold is allocated between the loan balance and the servicing asset based on their relative fair values 
the capitalized value of mortgage servicing rights is amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net future servicing revenue 
mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of the initial carrying value  adjusted for amortization  or estimated fair value 
the carrying values are periodically evaluated for impairment 
for purposes of measuring impairment  the servicing rights are stratified into pools based on term and interest rate 
impairment represents the excess of the remaining capitalized cost of a stratified pool over its fair value  and is recorded through a valuation allowance 
the fair value of each servicing rights pool is calculated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate  given current market conditions 
estimates of fair value include assumptions about prepayment speeds  interest rates and other factors which are subject to change over time 
changes in these underlying assumptions could cause 
table of contents the fair value of mortgage servicing rights  and the related valuation allowance  if any  to change significantly in the future 
we also use our judgment in the valuation of other intangible assets core deposit base intangibles 
core deposit base intangible assets have been recorded for core deposits defined as checking  money market and savings deposits that have been acquired in acquisitions that were accounted for as purchase business combinations 
the core deposit base intangible assets have been recorded using the assumption that they provide a more favorable source of funding than more expensive wholesale borrowings 
an intangible asset has been recorded for the present value of the difference between the expected interest to be incurred on these deposits and interest expense that would be expected if these deposits were replaced by wholesale borrowings  over the expected lives of the core deposits 
we currently estimate the underlying core deposits have lives of seven to fifteen years 
if we find these deposits have a shorter life  we will have to write down the asset by expensing the amount that is impaired 
we review goodwill at least annually for impairment  which requires the use of our judgment 
goodwill has been recorded as a result of two acquisitions in which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of tangible net assets acquired 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired  it would be expensed in the period in which it became impaired 
the assessment of our tax assets and liabilities involves the use of estimates  assumptions  interpretations  and judgments concerning certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes 
there can be no assurance that future events  such as court decisions  regulatory actions or interpretations  or changes in positions of federal and state taxing authorities will not differ from management s current assessment 
the impact of these matters could be significant to the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings 
comparisons of financial condition at december  and bank mutual corporation s total assets at december   were billion as compared to billion at december  total assets increased million or primarily as a result of investment of million into mortgage related securities funded by borrowing 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million in primarily as a result of using federal funds sold and interest earning deposits to purchase mortgage related securities  fund loans and deposit outflows 
investment securities available for sale increased  during as a result of the increased fair market value in mortgage related securities available for sale increased million in primarily as a result of the reinvestment of principle and interest payments received from the mortgage related securities portfolio and million of mortgage related securities purchased as a result of the additional borrowings 
we intend to use the repayments and prepayments on these securities to fund loans and  therefore  reduce the dollar amount of the mortgage related securities portfolio over time 
the current portfolio has a weighted average yield of approximately at december   however  the average yield earned for the year on the average portfolio was as compared to for the year of at december   we had million of private placement collateralized mortgage obligations cmos in our investment portfolio 
private placement cmos have more credit risk than government agency cmos and therefore  have a higher risk of impairment 
if permanent impairment would occur  a related impairment would reduce earnings

table of contents the following table sets forth our mortgage  consumer and commercial loan originations and purchases during the year ended december  in thousands originations mortgage loans consumer loans commercial business loans total loans originated purchases mortgage loans total loans purchased total loans originated and purchased loan originations decreased million in as compared to originations in  primarily as a result of relatively stable interest rates which prompted consumers to reduce the refinancing of their existing loans 
mortgage loan originations decreased million or and consumer loans decreased million or in as a result of the reduced refinancing of existing loans 
a majority of the consumer loan originations continued to be first and second mortgage loans 
we significantly increased our purchases of mortgage loans during to augment our loan originations 
each mortgage loan that is purchased is underwritten by us and conforms to our underwriting standards 
most of these purchased mortgage loans are in wisconsin or in states adjacent to wisconsin 
commercial business loan originations decreased million or in primarily as a result of reduced demand for commercial loans in our market area 
in  we hired an additional four experienced commercial loan originators in our continued efforts to emphasize commercial loan originations 
most of the new commercial loan originators were hired in the last six months of we anticipate that we will continue our emphasis not only on commercial loans but also on consumer loan originations to aid our asset and liability management and to aid in our overall profitability  although at somewhat more risk than traditional mortgage products 
loans held for sale at december  as compared to december  increased  as a result of a temporary decrease in market interest rates in the fourth quarter of  which resulted in more fixed rate mortgage loan originations and ultimately sales of fixed rate mortgage loans 
currently  we sell all of our year fixed rate mortgage loan originations and some of our and year fixed rate mortgage loan originations in the secondary mortgage market 
loans receivable increased million in as a result of growth in all loan products except commercial real estate and commercial business loans 
the one to four family mortgage loan portfolio increased million or primarily as a result of reduced fixed rate mortgage loan sales  reduced refinancing of existing loans  increased mortgage loans purchases from third parties and increased adjustable interest rate mortgage loan originations which are retained in the portfolio 
the multi family portfolio increased million or and the consumer loan portfolio increased million or both primarily as a result of reduced payoffs of existing loans 
the commercial real estate portfolio decreased million or primarily as a result of payoffs of related loans made to finance large apartment complexes 
these loans were refinanced by the borrower with another company 
the commercial business loan portfolio decreased million or primarily as a result of reduced originations and the transfer of million of commercial non performing loans to real estate owned and repossessed assets and ultimate disposal of the collateral or write off of the loans 
management expects to continue to emphasize consumer  non residential mortgage loan and commercial business loan originations  as we believe they will continue to add to the overall profitability and aid in the management of interest rate risk 
however  these loans can present higher credit risks than residential mortgage loans 

table of contents goodwill resulted from the acquisitions of first northern in and first federal bancshares of eau claire first federal in under the financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired  it will be expensed in the period in which it became impaired 
no impairment of goodwill occurred in  or other intangible assets are composed of core deposit base intangibles which were also the result of the first northern and first federal eau claire acquisitions 
other intangible assets are amortized over their expected life and tested for impairment at least annually 
mortgage servicing rights are established on mortgage loans that we originate and sell 
see significant accounting policies above and comparisons of operating results for years ended december  and noninterest income below for a further discussion of mortgage servicing rights 
other assets are comprised of the following at december  in thousands accrued interest mortgage related securities investment securities loans receivable total accrued interest foreclosed properties and repossessed assets premises and equipment federal home loan bank stock  at cost bank owned life insurance other our foreclosed properties and repossessed assets increased  to million at december  as a result of foreclosures on commercial business loans 
we believe that we continue to have good asset quality  particularly in our residential portfolio  and the homes  boats  recreational vehicles and other items that have been repossessed  are small in dollar amount in comparison to the size of our loan portfolio 
premises and equipment decreased million in primarily as a result of normal depreciation of these assets 
we anticipate that two or three new bank office buildings will be established in the effect of these new bank offices will be an increase to our premises and equipment depreciation expense 
federal home loan bank fhlb of chicago stock increased million primarily as a result of stock dividends paid by the fhlb of chicago 
the fhlb of chicago requires that its members own fhlb of chicago stock as a condition for borrowing 
the fhlb of chicago generally pays dividends and had targeted a rate of return for their stock of over the year constant maturity treasury note yield 
recently  the fhlb of chicago modified its dividend payout policy to a dividend payout ratio not to exceed of its adjusted core income  which is net income excluding gains or losses from non recurring events 
historically  the fhlb of chicago stock has met or exceeded its targeted returns but we cannot assure that will continue 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note borrowings 
bank owned life insurance boli is an asset that is used to partially offset the future cost of employee benefits 
boli is long term life insurance on the lives of certain current and past employees where the insurance policy benefits and ownership are retained by us 
we value boli at the amount which we could obtain if we cashed in the policies at the current time 
the cash value accumulation on boli is permanently tax deferred if the policy is held to the insured person s death 

table of contents deposits decreased million in primarily as a result of our decision to offer interest rates on longer term deposits at interest rates that approximate market average interest rates rather than offering higher promotional deposit rates 
we believe that deposit growth or shrinkage for future periods will continue to depend  in a significant part  on the performance of other investment alternatives and world events 
early in  we contracted with a wholesale deposit program which has the potential to increase the amount of our wholesale deposits 
our borrowings increased million in  as a result of the increase in the securities and loan portfolio  the decrease in the deposit portfolio and the repurchase of our shares 
in  we refinanced two federal home loan bank of chicago borrowings totaling million that had maturities in november and december of the refinanced borrowings are due in september prior to refinancing  the interest rates on the borrowings were and while  the new two year fhlb borrowing has a fixed interest rate of 
as a result of this transaction  we paid a million prepayment penalty 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we borrowed an additional million from the fhlb  on customary terms offered by the fhlb to member institutions 
in addition to the foregoing borrowings  we also had outstanding overnight borrowings of million at december  and million of short term fixed rate borrowing which matured early in january and was refinanced on similar short term basis  these additional borrowings also were on terms and conditions which the fhlb generally makes available to member institutions 
we use overnight and short term borrowings to fund loan originations and decreases in deposits on a shorter term basis 
shareholders equity decreased million in primarily as a result of the repurchase of shares  dividends paid in  a decrease in our accumulated other comprehensive income and an increase in unearned deferred compensation offset by our net earnings 
we repurchased  shares in at an average price of 
in addition  on december   we announced another million share repurchase plan that began january  on february   our existing repurchase plan was modified by authorizing an additional million shares a total of million shares to be repurchased 
in  through february th  we have repurchased an additional  shares  at an average price of per share 
we increased our quarterly cash dividend to per share for the first and second quarter of  and again increased our cash dividend to per share for the third and fourth quarter of the dividend payout ratio for was  and total dividends paid during the year were million 
in february  we further increased our dividend to per share  our total dividends paid will not increase proportionately  however  as a result of our share repurchases 
accumulated other comprehensive income decreased million in primarily as a result of unfunded supplemental non qualified benefit plan obligation and reduced fair market value on the mortgage related securities 
accumulated other comprehensive income reflects the difference between the net current value of securities available for sale and the book value of those securities  net of tax  and any unfunded supplemental non qualified benefit plan obligation  net of tax 
after the shareholders approved the stock incentive plan  restricted shares were issued which increased unearned deferred compensation 
our shareholders equity to total assets ratio at december  was as compared to at december

table of contents comparisons of operating results for years ended december  and general net income was million for as compared to million for the increase is primarily the result of investing the million of net capital received from our stock offering in october  which resulted in increases in interest income and the net interest margin  and from a million gain on sale of real estate 
these items were partially offset by reduction in the gains on the sales of loans  payment of a borrowing prepayment penalty  and increases in operating expenses 
net interest income net interest income for increased million  or to million as compared to million for net interest income increased primarily as a result of the investment of the million of net stock proceeds and as a result of the investment of the proceeds  an increased net interest margin 
the net interest margin for was as compared to for the increase in the net interest margin for was primarily the result of investing the million of net capital received from the stock offering the capital bears no interest in late the increase in the dollar amount of interest earning assets was also the result of the investment of the capital received from the company s stock offering 
most of the capital received was invested in mortgage related securities 
going forward  since the effect of the increased capital was reflected for all of  we do not expect to achieve a similar effect in total interest income total interest income for increased million or  to million as compared to million for the increase was primarily the result of the increased dollar amount of mortgage related securities partially offset by the decrease in the yields earned on the loan portfolio 
interest income on loans decreased million or to million as compared to million in the decrease was primarily the result of the reduced average yield earned on the portfolio partially offset by an increase in the average dollar amount of the loan portfolio outstanding 
market interest rates on most loan originations throughout were below the existing yield on the loan portfolio and a large number of payoffs were on loans that were in excess of the average yield of loans in our loan portfolio 
these events reduced our average yield on the loan to in as compared to in interest income on investment securities decreased  or primarily as a result of reduced average dollar amount outstanding and reduced yield on those investments 
interest income on mortgage related securities increased million or as a result of investing the million of net stock proceeds in late and additional borrowings in into mortgage related securities 
all of the funds were invested in mortgage related securities with initial average lives of to years and at a yield of approximately interest income on interest earning deposits which includes federal funds sold decreased million or as a result of reduced dollars outstanding partially offset by an increase in average yield on those deposits 
the federal funds sold and interest earning deposits at december  were reinvested into mortgage related securities 
interest expense interest expense on deposits decreased million or as a result of decreased average cost of deposits and decreased dollar amount of deposits 
the average cost of deposits for was as compared to in the decrease in the cost of deposits was the result of relatively flat market interest rates and our efforts to price deposits closer to the median of the market rather than at the higher end of the market offerings 
however  as a result of this pricing decision  our deposit portfolio decreased throughout interest expense on borrowings decreased million or as a result of the reduced average cost of borrowings partially offset by an increase in the dollar amount of average borrowings 
average borrowings in increased million and at december   borrowings were million higher than at december  we used the proceeds of these borrowings as well as our existing capital resources  to fund an increase in the loan portfolio  an increase in mortgage related securities  a decrease in the deposit portfolio and repurchases of our 
table of contents shares 
in the fourth quarter of  we borrowed million from the fhlb of chicago at a cost of and reinvested those funds into mortgage related securities 
the average cost of borrowings in was as compared to in the decrease in the average cost was the result of the new borrowings being added at a cost that was less than the average cost of borrowings and the refinancing of million in september of the refinanced million of borrowings had an average cost of and were refinanced at an interest rate of 
as a result of prepaying the million of fhlb borrowing  we paid a prepayment penalty of million 
the prepayment of the fhlb borrowings was done as a result of management anticipating a rise in interest rates at the time the original fhlb borrowings matured and its desire to lock in relatively lower interest rates  which should favorably affect related interest expense going forward  the prepayment fees were more than offset by interest savings 
the balance of our borrowings at december  were overnight funds or fixed rate short term borrowings 
provision for loan losses provisions for loan losses in and were million 
the million in the provisions for loan losses for was primarily determined as a result of charge offs of loans totaling million 
the charge offs in were primarily attributed to one commercial loan that was placed in real estate owned and subsequently liquidated 
in addition  there is one large commercial loan  of approximately million that was non performing at december  that we are closely monitoring and working with the business owners in an effort to arrange repayment 
the dollar amount of the typical commercial real estate  development and commercial loan tends to be larger than our single family loans and  therefore  any loss that we experience on these loans could be larger than what we have historically experienced on our single family loans 
depending on the type of commercial loan  the collateral may appeal only to a specialized group of people or businesses and therefore  may limit the number of potential buyers of the collateral  or in the case of collateral that is comprised of inventory  the liquidation of the collateral is more uncertain if a problem should arise 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was million or of non performing loans and of non performing assets as compared to million or of non performing loans and of non performing assets at december  the loan loss allowance to total loans was at december  as compared to at december  future provisions for loan losses will continue to be based upon our assessment of the overall loan portfolio and the underlying collateral  trends in non performing loans  current economic conditions and other relevant factors in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels to provide for probable and estimatable losses 
the establishment of the amount of the loan loss allowance inherently involves judgments by management as to the adequacy of the allowance  which ultimately may or may not be correct 
higher rates of loan defaults than anticipated would likely result in a need to increase provisions in future years 
also  as multi family and commercial loan portfolios increase  additional provisions would likely be added to the loan loss allowances as they carry a higher risk of loss 
see also asset quality in item  which is incorporated by reference  for certain other factors that may affect our provisions for loan losses on a go forward basis 
noninterest income total noninterest income decreased million or to million as compared to million for the decrease was primarily the result of decreased dollar amount of loan sales which correspondently decreased the gains on sales of loans 
service charges on deposits decreased  in primarily as a result of the decreased number of deposit accounts and customer utilization of on line banking and credit cards 
we believe the reduced number of checking accounts is the result of our change in the checking account pricing policy in brokerage and insurance commissions increased  or as a result of increased annuity and insurance sales 
loan related fees and servicing revenue increased  or in primarily as a result of million of mortgage loan servicing rights becoming impaired in  which offset related income in that year 
in  there were no impairments to the mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing rights normally become impaired 
table of contents from increased prepayments on mortgage loans which reduces the anticipated servicing fee income over the life of the loan 
gains on sales of loans decreased substantially in as a result of reduced dollar amount of loan sales 
loan sales in were million as compared to million in in the third quarter of  we sold one half of our interest in approximately acres of owned real estate to an unrelated third party  the transaction resulted in a million gain 
we simultaneously established a limited liability company arrowood development with that party  in which we maintain a interest  to develop the land 
it is anticipated that the development of the real estate into a residential subdivision and subsequent sale of the developed lots will be a two to four year project 
other income increased  or in primarily as the result of increased atm and checkcard fees 
noninterest expense compensation expense increased million or to million in as compared to million in the increase was primarily the result of reduced compensation and benefit cost deferrals on loan originations  vesting of restricted shares from the and stock incentive plans and increased cost of benefits which included retirement and health expenses 
each loan that is originated has an incremental compensation and benefit cost determined and as loan originations decrease the incremental compensation and benefit cost deferrals decrease 
in  as a result of reduced refinancings of existing loans  the compensation and benefit cost deferrals decreased million as compared to at the annual meeting  shareholders approved a stock incentive plan which authorized  stock options and  shares for a management recognition plan mrp or restricted stock 
in may   shares of restricted stock was granted to various officers 
this grant and the fair market valuation of esop shares increased compensation expense approximately million in as compared to health insurance and pension costs increased a million primarily as a result of increased health insurance premiums and decreased rates of return on pension investments 
occupancy and equipment expense remained fairly constant when compared to primarily as a result of not adding any new offices in however  in  we anticipate adding two new branch offices in the racine area and one new office in the waukesha area 
the net effect of adding these new offices will be to increase our occupancy and equipment expense and other operating expenses in other expenses increased slightly in as compared to however  within the other expenses  marketing costs decreased  primarily as a result of the non recurring expenses associated with the merger of our two subsidiary banks in march this marketing expense decrease was offset by increases in real estate owned expense associated with the disposal of a large commercial loan and increased auditing costs associated with the internal control attestation required as part of the implementation of sarbanes oxley act section income taxes the effective tax rate for was  as compared to an effective tax rate of in bank owned life insurance income is permanently tax deferred if the policy is held to the participant s death 
therefore  the income earned on the life insurance is not included in taxable income for the calculation of tax expense 
like many wisconsin financial institutions  we have non wisconsin subsidiaries which hold and manage investment assets  the income on which has not been subject to wisconsin tax 
the wisconsin department of revenue has instituted an audit program specifically aimed at out of state bank subsidiaries 
the department has asserted the position that some or all of the income of the out of state subsidiaries is taxable in wisconsin 
the department is conducting audits of many such organizations  including our nevada subsidiaries  its audit of bank mutual and its nevada subsidiaries has not yet been concluded  and the department has not asserted a claim against the bank or its subsidiaries 
the department sent letters in late july to wisconsin financial institutions whether or not they were undergoing an audit reporting on settlements relating to these issues involving  at that time  financial institutions 
table of contents and their out of state investment subsidiaries 
the letter provided a summary of available settlement parameters 
for prior periods they include restrictions on the types of subsidiary income excluded from wisconsin taxation  assessment of certain back taxes relating to a limited time period  limitations on net operating loss carry forwards and interest on past due taxes but no penalties 
for and going forward  the letter states similar provisions  including limits on subsidiaries assets which could be considered in determining income not subject to wisconsin taxation 
as outlined  the settlement would result in the rescission of prior letter rulings  and purport to be binding going forward except for future legislation or change by mutual agreement 
however  the letter appears to implicitly accept the general proposition that some out of state investment subsidiary income is not subject to wisconsin taxes 
the department s positions may be challenged by one or more financial institution in the state 
the company has engaged in discussions with the department and has advised the department that it wishes to receive and consider a proposal from the department 
in particular  the company asked the department to consider some specific factors which the company believes may distinguish it from many other institutions 
we have received certain information from the department to further evaluate its position and our alternatives under our particular circumstances 
the company believes that it will need more specific detail than was included in the department s july letter or subsequent communications to quantify in any definitive way the department s view of its exposure  either for past periods or with respect to operations going forward  and to evaluate the company s alternatives 
a determination on how to proceed will depend in part on further communication from and actions by the department 
depending upon the terms and circumstances  an adverse resolution of these matters could result in additional wisconsin tax obligations for prior periods and or higher wisconsin taxes going forward  with a substantial negative impact on the earnings of bank mutual corporation 
the company believes it has reported income and paid wisconsin taxes in accordance with applicable legal requirements  and the department s long standing interpretations thereof 
we also may incur further costs in the future to address these issues 

table of contents comparisons of operating results for years ended december  and general net income was million for as compared to million for the decrease is primarily the result of decreased net interest margin and increases in the provisions for loan losses and operating expenses these items were partially offset by an increase in the gains on the sale of loans 
net interest income net interest income for decreased million  or  to million as compared to million for net interest income decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in the net interest margin 
the net interest margin for was as compared to for although market interest rates for loans and deposits remained fairly stable throughout  the high level of loan refinancing activity  in which higher interest rate loans were paid off  downward interest rate modifications on existing loans and the sales of fixed rate mortgage loans decreased the yield on the loan portfolio more than the decrease in the cost of funds 
total interest income total interest income for decreased million  or  to million as compared to million for the decrease was primarily the result of existing loans being refinanced to lower interest rate loans  sales of fixed rate mortgage loans in which the proceeds were invested in lower yielding mortgage related securities  and prepayments of higher yielding mortgage related securities 
interest income on loans decreased million  or in to million as compared to million in the decrease was primarily the result of refinancing of existing loans to lower interest rate loans  loan originations that were at interest rates below the existing yield on the portfolio  downward interest rate modifications on certain existing loans and reduced average dollars outstanding for the year 
although was the second consecutive year of record originations  it was also a record year of loan sales 
we sell our year and some of our and year fixed rate mortgage loan originations to help us manage interest rate risk 
all of these events reduced the average yield on our loan portfolio to for as compared to for interest income on investment securities decreased  or primarily as a result of reduced dollars invested and a reduced yield on those investments 
as investments matured the proceeds were either reinvested into an investment at a lower yield or invested into mortgage related securities 
interest income on mortgage related securities decreased million or  as a result of higher yielding mortgage related securities being prepaid and the reinvestment of those dollars into mortgage related securities that were below the existing yield on the portfolio 
in addition  we invested million of the million of proceeds from the stock offering by the end of november of and million in december of interest income on interest earning deposits which includes federal funds sold decreased  or  primarily as a result of the decreased yield earned on the deposits 
the average balance of interest earning deposits increased million in to million as compared to million in the weighted average yield on interest earning deposits for was as compared to for interest expense interest expense on deposits decreased million or as a result of decreased costs of deposits 
the average cost of deposits decreased to in from in primarily as a result of market interest rates trending lower throughout and the mix of the types of deposits 
savings deposits increased whereas  the higher cost time deposits decreased 
we purposely reduced the offering interest rates on some of our time deposit products to decrease our cost of funds and to limit the growth 
although the cost of deposits decreased throughout  and our policy to be somewhat less aggressive in pricing our deposit products as a result of our liquidity position  it did not decrease as much as the yield on interest earning assets  therefore  our net interest margin was compressed 

table of contents interest expense on borrowings decreased million or  as a result of less borrowings outstanding for average borrowings outstanding for was million as compared to million for provisions for loan losses provisions for loan losses in were million as compared to  for the increase in the provision for loan losses was primarily the result of increased commercial business loan delinquencies and  to a lesser extent  a change in the loan portfolio composition 
we have two commercial borrowers with loans totaling million that became non performing in both commercial borrowers have experienced reduced sales for their products and are experiencing operating losses 
one commercial borrower  with an aggregate of million in loans  had been current in its loan payments until the fourth quarter of in which it became delinquent 
the other borrower with an aggregate of million in loans  has also experienced reduced sales however  they are delinquent in their payments 
the dollar amount of the typical commercial real estate  development and commercial loan tends to be larger than our single family loans and  therefore  any loss that we experience on these loans could be larger than what we have historically experienced on our single family loans 
depending on the type of commercial loan  the collateral may appeal only to a specialized group of people or businesses and therefore  may limit the number of potential buyers of the collateral  or in the case of collateral that is comprised of inventory  the liquidation of the collateral is more uncertain if a problem should arise 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was million or of non performing loans and of non performing assets as compared to million or of non performing loans and of non performing assets at december  the loan loss allowance to total loans was at december  as compared to at december  noninterest income total noninterest income increased million or to million for as compared to million for the increase is primarily the result of increased gains on the sales of loans and the reduction of the valuation allowance for mortgage servicing rights 
service charges on deposits increased  in as a result of increased number of accounts which pay service fees normally checking accounts and a pricing increase in which deposit fees were increased 
brokerage and insurance commissions decreased  in primarily as a result of decreased securities and fixed rate tax deferred annuity sales 
loan related fees and servicing revenues increased million in as a result of reducing the valuation allowance for mortgage servicing rights 
in and early  mortgage servicing rights were determined to be temporarily impaired  therefore  servicing revenue was decreased and a valuation allowance was established to reflect the proper value 
as loan refinancings decreased thereby reducing principal prepayments  the mortgage servicing rights increased in value 
at that point  the entire valuation allowance was reduced  the effect of which is reflected in the increased loan related fees and servicing revenues 
gains on the sale of investment increased  as a result of a sale of an investment 
gains on the sales of loans increased  as a result of increased dollar amount of loans sold 
we sold million of fixed rate mortgage loans in as compared to million in gains on the sales of loans are primarily dependent on the dollar amount of fixed rate mortgage loan originations and the sale of those loans 
if interest rates remain flat or increase  these gains could be reduced in future periods as sales are likely to decrease as experienced in the fourth quarter of 
other noninterest income increased  in primarily as a result of an increase in debit card fees and income on assets held in a rabbi trust 

table of contents noninterest expense total noninterest expense increased million primarily as a result of a modest increase in compensation and related expenses  an increase in costs associated with updating our data processing equipment and software  and an increase in costs associated with opening a new office and replacing an existing office 
compensation  payroll taxes  and other employee benefit expense increased  or as a result of compensation and benefit increases partially offset by a  recapture of a self funded health plan reserve 
occupancy and equipment expense increased  as a result of deploying upgraded teller pcs  purchasing new teller software throughout our bank office network in  and the construction of a new bank office and a replacement bank office in the later part of other expenses increased  primarily as a result of increased marketing expenses  costs associated with the consolidation of the two subsidiary banks and a branding campaign for the resulting bank  and atm and electronic banking fees

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the term liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to fund loan originations  loan purchases  deposit withdrawals  and operating expenses 
our primary sources of funds are deposits  scheduled amortization  and prepayments of loan principal and mortgage related securities  maturities and calls of investment securities  borrowings from the fhlb of chicago and funds provided by our operations 
historically  these sources of funds have been adequate to maintain liquidity  with more borrowing in periods in which their operations generate less cash 
in the event these sources of liquidity would become inadequate  bank mutual believes that it could access the wholesale deposit market  although there can be no assurances that wholesale deposits would be available if needed 
during  we substantially increased our levels of fhlb borrowings  in part to take advantage of what we believe were favorable borrowing opportunities and in part to fund growth without the need to grow deposits by offering above market promotional interest rates 
loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds 
however  deposit flows  calls of investment securities and prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities are strongly influenced by interest rates  general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace 
for example  during  loan prepayments decreased significantly because of the stable interest rate environment  another very different interest rate environment could lead to a significantly different result 
these factors reduce the predictability of the timing of these sources of funds 
our primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of one to four family real estate loans  multi family and commercial real estate loans  home equity loans  other consumer loans  commercial business loans  the purchase of mortgage related securities  and to a lesser extent  the purchase of investment securities 
these investing activities were funded by principal payments on mortgage loans and mortgage related securities  calls and maturities on investment securities  borrowings  deposits  and funds provided by our operating activities 
at december   we exceeded each of the applicable regulatory capital requirements for our savings bank subsidiary 
in order to be classified as well capitalized by the fdic we are required to have leverage tier capital of at least 
to be classified as a well capitalized bank by the fdic  we must also have a risk based total capital ratio of at least

see notes to consolidated financial statements note shareholders equity 
we believe that our relatively high capital levels as compared to industry standards  which primarily resulted from our stock offering in  provide us with the flexibility to increase leverage through borrowings  as we did in  and to prudently repurchase shares  as we have with share repurchase programs in and shareholders equity is decreased by unearned esop shares  which represents shares in the bank mutual employee stock ownership plan which have not yet been earned by participating employees  and unearned deferred compensation  which represents stock grants under the management recognition plan mrp component of its and stock incentive plans

shareholders equity is decreased by million of accumulated other comprehensive income  consisting primarily of net unrealized losses  net of taxes  on securities available for sale 
bank mutual corporation in repurchased  shares under its stock repurchase programs  of which  restricted shares were re issued to officers and directors in accordance with the stock incentive plan and  were re issued for exercises of stock options 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million during  however  we still maintained million of cash and cash equivalents at december  the company used million for investing activities  primarily as a result of purchases of mortgage related and investment securities and an increase in the loan portfolio  partially offset by principal repayments on mortgage related securities 
the cash from operating activities of million is primarily a result of bank mutual s net income for the year  and non cash expenses  offset by a net increase in other assets 
cash provided by financing activities of million resulted primarily from the net proceeds of the borrowings  offset by our repurchases of securities and decreases in deposits 
contractual obligations  commitments  contingent liabilities  and off balance sheet arrangements the company has various financial obligations  including contractual obligations and commitments  that may require future cash payments 

table of contents the following table presents  as of december  significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date 
further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in the referenced note to the consolidated financial statements 
payments due in one to three to over one year three five five or less years years years total in thousands deposits without a stated maturity a certificates of deposits a borrowed funds a operating leases purchase obligations deferred retirement plans and deferred compensation plans a excludes interest to be paid in the periods indicated 
the company s operating lease obligations represent short and long term lease and rental payments for facilities  certain software and data processing and other equipment 
purchase obligations represent obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
the purchase obligation amounts presented above primarily relate to certain contractual payments for services provided for information technology 
the company also has obligations under its deferred retirement plan for directors as described in note to the consolidated financial statements

table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and accompanying notes of bank mutual corporation have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of inflation 
risk factors in addition to the various factors discussed above  you should consider carefully the following risk factors when evaluating bank mutual corporation s performance and outlook 
the current interest rate environment is having an adverse impact on our net interest income 
beginning in june  the federal reserve board began increasing the federal funds target rate with the targeted rate being increased five times in and once in february since these interest rate increases began  interest rates on short term deposits have increased slightly 
for example  the federal funds target rate was as of december  and at december   the rate was 
the ten year treasury bond rate was as of december  and at december  the rate was 
if interest rates continue to rise  the amount of interest we pay on deposits could increase more quickly than the amount of interest we receive on our loans  mortgage related securities and investment securities 
this could cause our profits to decrease 
rising interest rates would likely reduce the value of our mortgage related securities and investment securities and may decrease demand for loans and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay their loans 
increasing market interest rates may also depress property values  which could affect the value of collateral securing our loans 
for additional information on our exposure to interest rates  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk 
if our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings could decrease 
our loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of the loans  and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance 
we therefore may experience significant loan losses  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
material additions to our allowance also would materially decrease our net income  and the charge off of loans may cause us to increase the allowance 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
we rely on our loan quality reviews  our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions  among other factors  in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses 
if our assumptions prove to be incorrect  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio  resulting in additions to our allowance 
our emphasis on a diverse loan portfolio has been one of the more significant factors we have taken into account in evaluating our allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses 
if we were to further increase the amount of loans in our portfolio other than traditional real estate loans  we may decide to make increased provisions for loan losses 
in addition  bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge offs 
we are expanding our lending activities in riskier areas 
we have identified commercial real estate  commercial business and consumer loans as areas for increased lending emphasis 
while increased lending diversification is expected to increase interest income  non residential loans carry greater risk of payment default than residential real estate loans 
as the volume of these loans increase  credit risk increases 
in the event of substantial borrower defaults  our provision for loan losses would increase and therefore  earnings would be reduced 
our consumer loan portfolio included million of indirect auto loans at december  borrowers may be more likely to become delinquent on an automobile loan than on a residential real estate loan 
moreover  unlike the collateral for real estate loans  automobiles depreciate rapidly and  in the event of default  principal loss as a percent of the loan balance depends upon the mileage and condition of the vehicle at the time of repossession  over which 
table of contents the bank has no control 
similarly  any non real estate collateral securing commercial business loans may depreciate over time and fluctuate in value 
increases in market interest rates are likely to adversely affect equity 
as of december   we owned billion of securities available for sale 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we carry these securities at fair value on our balance sheet 
unrealized gains or losses on these securities  reflecting the difference between the fair market value and the amortized cost  net of its tax effect  are carried as a component of shareholders equity 
when market rates of interest increase  the fair value of our securities available for sale generally decreases and equity correspondingly decreases 
when rates decrease  fair value generally increases and shareholders equity correspondingly increases 
as of december   the company s available for sale portfolio had an unrealized loss of million 
low demand for real estate loans may lower our profitability 
making loans secured by real estate is our primary business and primary source of profits 
if customer demand for real estate loans decreases  our profits may decrease because our alternative investments  primarily securities  earn less income for us than real estate loans 
customer demand for loans secured by real estate could be reduced by a weaker economy  an increase in unemployment  a decrease in real estate values or an increase in interest rates 
strong competition within our market area may reduce our customer base 
we encounter strong competition both in attracting deposits and originating real estate and other loans 
we compete with commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking firms  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment banking firms 
our market area includes branches of several commercial banks that are substantially larger than us in terms of deposits and loans 
in addition  tax exempt credit unions operate in most of our market area and aggressively price their products and services to a large part of the population 
our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully maintain or increase our market share 
we have significant intangible assets which may need to be written off as an expense in the future 
the company has approximately million in goodwill  million in other intangible assets and million of mortgage servicing rights as of december  as a result of sfas no 
 the company no longer amortizes goodwill but will continue to amortize the other intangible assets over seven to fifteen years and will evaluate the mortgage servicing rights for impairment on a monthly basis 
we will periodically check goodwill  and the other intangible assets for impairment 
at some point in the future  our intangible assets may become impaired  and we would need to write them off as a reduction to earnings in the period in which they became impaired 
stock based and other benefits affect our results 
we have adopted stock incentive plans which provided for the granting of options to purchase common stock and for awards of common stock to our eligible officers  employees and directors 
we also have an employee stock ownership plan  and have adopted a restoration plan that will supplement the benefits to selected executive officers under the employee stock ownership plan and our k plan 
the cost of the employee stock ownership plan will vary based on our stock price at specific points in the future 
additionally  we experienced an increase in employee health care costs in  and expect further increases in these expenses will continue to affect our future earnings  as may other factors  such as government mandates  which would further increase the cost of compensation and or benefits that are provided to employees 
wisconsin tax developments could reduce our net income 
the bank has nevada subsidiaries which hold and manage investment securities and other investments 
because the subsidiaries are out of state  related income has not been subject to tax in wisconsin 
the wisconsin department of revenue has implemented a program for the audit of wisconsin financial institutions who have formed and contributed assets to subsidiaries located in nevada  and presumably will seek to impose wisconsin state income taxes on income from those operations  at least on a going forward basis 
the department has announced terms and conditions on which is has settled similar issues with other financial institutions in the state 
the company believes that it will need more specific detail than was included in that announcement or subsequent communications to quantify in any definitive way the department s view of its exposure  either for past periods or with respect to operations going forward  and to evaluate the company s alternatives 
a determination on how to proceed will depend in part on further communication from and actions by the department 
depending upon the terms and circumstances  an adverse resolution of these matters could result in additional wisconsin tax obligations for prior periods and or higher wisconsin taxes going forward  with a substantial negative impact on the earnings of bank mutual corporation 
we may also need to incur costs in the future to address any action taken against us by the department 

table of contents our ability to grow may be limited if we cannot make acquisitions 
in an effort to fully deploy the capital we raised in our stock offering  we intend to seek to expand our banking franchise  internally by de novo branching and by acquiring other financial institutions or branches and other financial services providers 
however  we have no specific plans for acquisitions at this time 
our ability to grow through selective acquisitions of other financial institutions or branches will depend on successfully identifying  acquiring and integrating those institutions or branches 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate internal growth or identify attractive acquisition candidates  make acquisitions on favorable terms or successfully integrate any acquired institutions or branches 
our return on shareholders equity is reduced as a result of the offering 
net income divided by average shareholders equity  known as return on equity  is a ratio many investors use to compare the performance of a financial institution to its peers 
due to the large amount of additional capital that we raised in our stock offering in late  our return on equity decreased as compared to our performance in prior years  pending optimal deployment of that additional capital 
while we have deployed a significant amount of that capital including market purchases of our shares in our share repurchase programs  our capital remains relatively high by industry standards 
until we can increase our net interest income and non interest income  we expect that our return on equity may be below the industry average  which may negatively impact the value of our common stock 
our borrowings have significantly increased  which further exposes us to the risks of leverage 
although our capital levels remain high  we substantially increased our borrowings in borrowings tend to be a more costly source of funds than deposits 
in addition  if interest rates change substantially  we may be less able to adjust our interest rate exposure on these borrowings than we would in the case of deposits 
we will also need to have capital resources or other sources of funds to repay these borrowings when they come due  which we cannot assure 
economic conditions and world events could affect our earnings 
the united states economy began to improve in and continued to improve in according to economists 
however  significant uncertainty remains in the economy 
we do not know how swift or strong the recovery will be or how long it will continue 
the effects of a recession  or a weak economy  can significantly affect our operations and profitability 
for example  higher unemployment and reduced business sales or profits can make it more difficult for borrowers to repay their loans 
similarly  reduced income or confidence can lead consumers to reduce their purchases  and thus reduce loan demand 
the national and local economies were adversely affected by the attacks of september  and their aftermath and other world events such as the iraq conflict 
bank mutual corporation  and the economy as a whole  may be affected by future world events  such as acts of terrorism  developments in the war on terrorism  conflict in the middle east  and the international situation in north korea and iran

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk the bank s ability to maintain net interest income depends upon earning a higher yield on assets than the rates we pay on deposits and borrowings 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both our level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our assets and liabilities 
fluctuations in interest rates will also affect the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the difference between amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which either reprice or mature during a given period of time 
the difference  or the interest rate sensitivity gap  provides an indication of the extent to which our interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates 
see gap analysis below 
due to the nature of our operations  we are not directly subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
instead  our real estate loan portfolio  concentrated in wisconsin  is subject to risks associated with the local economy 
we seek to coordinate asset and liability decisions so that  under changing interest rate scenarios  earnings will remain within an acceptable range 
the primary objectives of our interest rate management strategy are to maintain earnings and capital within self imposed parameters over a range of possible interest rate environments  coordinate interest rate risk policies and procedures with other elements of our business plan  all within the context of the current business environment and our capital and liquidity requirements  and manage interest rate risk in a manner consistent with the approved guidelines and policies set by our board of directors 
to achieve the objectives of managing interest rate risk  our asset liability committee meets periodically to discuss and monitor the market interest rate environment and provides reports to the board of directors 
this committee is comprised of senior management 
historically  our lending activities have emphasized one to four family first and second mortgage loans 
our primary source of funds has been deposits and borrowings  consisting primarily of time deposits and borrowings which have substantially shorter terms to maturity than the loan portfolio 
we have employed certain strategies to manage the interest rate risk inherent in the asset liability mix  including emphasizing the origination of adjustable rate and certain year fixed rate mortgage loans for our portfolio  and selling certain and year fixed rate mortgage loans and all year fixed rate mortgage loans  maintaining a significant level of investment securities and mortgage related securities with a weighted average life of less than eight years or with interest rates that reprice in less than five years  and managing deposits and borrowings to provide stable funding 

table of contents we believe that the frequent repricing of our adjustable rate mortgage loans  the cash flows from our year fixed rate real estate loans  the shorter duration of our consumer loans  and adjustable rate features and shorter durations of our investment securities  reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
gap analysis 
repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a financial institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that specific time period 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period 
during a period of rising interest rates  a financial institution with a negative gap position would be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater increase in the costs of its liabilities relative to the yields of its assets and thus a decrease in the institution s net interest income 
an institution with a positive gap position would be expected  absent the effect of other factors  to experience the opposite result 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to reduce net interest income 
at december   based on the assumptions below  our interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year exceeded our interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period by million 
this represented a negative cumulative one year interest rate sensitivity gap of  and a ratio of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year to interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year of 
the following table presents the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which we anticipate to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
the information presented in the following table is based on the following assumptions i investment securities based upon contractual maturities and if applicable  call dates 
ii mortgage related securities based upon an independent outside source for determining cash flows prepayment speeds 
iii loans based upon contractual maturities  repricing date  if applicable  scheduled repayments of principal and projected prepayments of principal based upon our historical experience or anticipated prepayments 
iv deposits based upon contractual maturities and our historical decay rates 
v borrowings based upon the earlier of call date or final maturity 

table of contents at december  within three to more than more than over three twelve one year three years five months months three years five years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans receivable mortgage loans fixed adjustable consumer loans commercial and industrial loans interest earning deposits investment securities mortgage related securities fixed adjustable other interest earning assets total interest earning assets noninterest bearing and interest bearing liabilities noninterest bearing demand accounts interest bearing liabilities deposits interest bearing demand accounts savings accounts money market accounts time deposits advance payments by borrowers for taxes and insurance borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage total assets cumulative interest earning assets as a percentage of interest bearing liabilities the methods used in the previous table have some inherent shortcomings 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the loan 
if interest rates change  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of borrowers to make payments on their adjustable rate loans may decrease if interest rates increase 

table of contents present value of equity in addition to the gap analysis table  we also use a simulation model to monitor interest rate risk 
the model reports the present value of equity in different interest rate environments  assuming an instantaneous and permanent interest rate shock to all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the present value of equity is the difference between the present value of expected cash flows of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the changes in market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates reflect the interest rate sensitivity of those assets and liabilities as their values are derived from the characteristics of the asset or liability ie  fixed rate  adjustable rate  caps  floors relative to the current interest rate environment 
for example  in a rising interest rate environment the fair market value of a fixed rate asset will decline  whereas the fair market value of an adjustable rate asset  depending on its repricing characteristics  may not decline 
increases in the market value of assets will increase the present value of equity whereas decreases in market value of assets will decrease the present value of equity 
conversely  increases in the market value of liabilities will decrease the present value of equity whereas decreases in the market value of liabilities will increase the present value of equity 
the following table presents the estimated present value of equity over a range of interest rate change scenarios at december  the present value ratio shown in the table is the present value of equity as a percent of the present value of total assets in each of the different rate environments 
for purposes of this table  we have made assumptions such as prepayment rates and decay rates similar to those used for the gap analysis table 
present value of equity as percent of present value of equity present value of assets change in dollar dollar percent present value percent interest rates amount change change ratio change basis points dollars in thousands as in the case of the gap analysis table  the methods we used in the previous table have some inherent shortcomings 
this type of modeling requires that we make assumptions which may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
for example  we make assumptions regarding the acceleration rate of the prepayment speeds of higher yielding mortgage loans 
prepayments will accelerate in a falling rate environment and the reverse will occur in a rising rate environment 
we also assume that decay rates on core deposits will accelerate in a rising rate environment and the reverse in a falling rate environment 
the table assumes that we will take no action in response to the changes in interest rates  when in practice rate changes on certain products  such as savings deposits  may lag market changes 
in addition  prepayment estimates and other assumptions within the model are subjective in nature  involve uncertainties  and therefore cannot be determined with precision 
accordingly  although the present value of the equity model may provide an estimate of our interest rate risk at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in interest rates on our present value of equity
