item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in item this discussion contains forward looking statements 
please see forward looking statements and risk factors for a discussion of items  uncertainties  assumptions and risks associated with these statements 
year in review our financial results for calendar year represented the third consecutive year of record revenues and earnings driven by strong performance from each of our segments 
our net earnings of million  or per diluted share  were up over the million  or per diluted share  earned in while each of our three business segments contributed to our higher levels of profitability  the increase in operating income in the jbt segment was most evident 
a significant part of the increased jbt operating income in was a result of our continued focus on capacity management 
capacity management is a continuous process of reviewing our freight to determine whether business which is generating low or negative margins can be replaced by different business with better margins 
we also are continuing to analyze our business to ensure we are charging for all services provided 
primarily due to our capacity management actions and rate increases required to offset certain non fuel cost increases  our jbt segment revenue per loaded mile  excluding fuel surcharges fsc  rose over during  we also focused on revenue per load  revenue per mile and revenue per tractor per day in our jbi and dcs business segments 
primarily due to our focus on rate increases and capacity management  we were able to increase revenue per loaded mile  excluding fsc  by in our jbi segment and net revenue per tractor per week by in our dcs segment 
these increases significantly contributed to our higher net earnings in our increase in consolidated net earnings was also a result of significantly lower insurance  claims and workers compensation costs 
we have continued to ingrain safety into our company culture and ask each of our drivers and other employees to make safety a daily priority 
our combined insurance claims and workers compensation expense declined approximately million from and increased our current year earnings per diluted share by approximately 
our consolidated operating ratio operating expenses divided by total operating revenues was  compared with in and in the current year was the first time in over ten years that we have achieved an operating ratio for a full year below 
we also paid off all of our remaining balance sheet debt and capital lease obligations in we re initiated paying a quarterly cash dividend in early and in december  increased our quarterly dividend from 
to 
per share and announced plans to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
therefore  the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and associated disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities are affected by these estimates 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following workers compensation and accident costs we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries workers compensation  vehicular collisions and accidents and cargo claims 
most insurance arrangements include a level of self insurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim  but provide an umbrella policy to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs that are completely insured 
the amounts of self insurance change from time to time based on certain measurement dates and policy expiration dates 
during  we were self insured for a portion of our claims exposure resulting from cargo loss  personal injury  property damage  workers compensation and health claims for amounts up to the first million for auto accidents and million for workers compensation claims 
these same levels of self insurance are in effect for our claims accrual policy for all self insured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims  analyses provided by third party claims administrators  as well as legal  economic and regulatory factors 
our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim 
the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature  timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available 
accordingly  we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability 
this process involves the use of loss development factors based on our historical claims experience 
in doing so  the recorded ultimate liability considers future claims growth and provides an allowance for incurred but not reported claims 
we do not discount our estimated losses 
at december   we had approximately million of estimated net claims payable 
in addition  we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums 
at december   we had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately million  which represented pre funded claims and premiums 
we are also substantially self insured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment 
revenue equipment we operate a significant number of tractors  trailers and containers in connection with our business 
this equipment may be purchased or acquired under capital or operating lease agreements 
in addition  we may rent revenue equipment from third parties and various railroads under short term rental arrangements 
revenue equipment which is purchased is depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated useful life down to an estimated salvage or trade in value 
equipment acquired under capital leases is initially recorded at the net present value of the minimum lease payments and amortized on the straight line method over the lease term or the estimated useful life  whichever is shorter 
we had no revenue equipment under capital lease arrangements at december  we have an agreement with our primary tractor supplier for guaranteed residual or trade in values for certain new equipment acquired since during the fourth quarter of  we reviewed the useful lives and salvage values of our tractor fleet 
we have utilized the guaranteed trade in values as well as other operational information  such as anticipated annual miles  in accounting for purchased and leased tractors 
if our tractor supplier was unable to perform under the terms of our agreement for guaranteed trade in values  it could have a materially negative impact on our financial results 
we periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our long lived assets for impairment 
we have not identified any impairments to our existing assets 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported 
accordingly  a portion of the total revenue which will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period 
segments we operated three segments during calendar year the operation of each of these businesses is described in footnote

this compares with our previous record net earnings of million in diluted earnings per share were in  also a record number  compared with in the average number of diluted shares outstanding in was approximately higher than the comparable number in consolidated operating revenues were billion in  an increase of over the billion in each of our business segments contributed to our improved financial results in while the overall economy and level of freight activity were not particularly strong during  a number of factors contributed to our improved level of earnings 
we have continued our focus on capacity management  as well as individual load and lane profitability 
a number of new proprietary technology tools and increased management focus have allowed us to reduce the amount of unprofitable lanes and freight  and to properly charge for equipment and services provided to customers 
in addition  the levels of available capacity in the industry have been reduced by significant increases in insurance  fuel  equipment and driver compensation costs 
the availability of qualified drivers has also limited carriers ability to expand the size of their fleets 
jbt segment jbt segment gross revenue was million in  up over the million in higher fuel surcharge fsc revenue in impacted this comparison 
if the amount of fsc revenue was excluded from both years  jbt segment revenue rose over the average tractor count in declined from however  revenue per loaded mile  excluding fsc  was above  offsetting the decrease in the tractor fleet and enhancing operating income 
current year revenue growth was also up approximately from outsourced freight activity 
operating income of the jbt segment rose to million in  from million in the significant increase in revenue per loaded mile  excluding fsc  accounted for the majority of this operating income improvement 
in addition  lower jbt accident and workers compensation costs positively impacted current year operating income 
jbi segment jbi segment gross revenue grew by  to  million in  from million in higher fsc revenue in impacted this comparison 
if fsc revenue was excluded from both years  jbi segment revenue increased over a significant portion of this revenue growth was driven by a increase in loads 
revenue per loaded mile  excluding fsc  was above levels 
the remaining portion of revenue growth was primarily a result of freight mix changes 
operating income in the jbi segment increased to million in from million in the increase in current year jbi operating income levels was partly a result of the higher revenue per loaded mile  excluding fsc  increased load volume and lower revenue equipment ownership costs  partly offset by higher rail and dray purchased transportation expenses 
dcs segment dcs segment revenue grew over to million in from in the higher level of fsc revenue in impacted this comparison 
if fsc revenue was excluded from both years  dcs segment revenue rose over the average number of trucks in the dedicated fleet increased nearly in the additional revenue growth in the current year was primarily a result of a increase in net revenue per tractor 
operating income increased to million in versus million in during  we have conducted reviews of our underperforming dedicated accounts and identified opportunities to either improve margins or redeploy assets 
we have also implemented cost controls and raised rates as appropriate 
these efforts have improved our dcs segment operating ratio to in from in the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 
percentage of operating revenue percentage change between years vs 
operating revenues operating expenses salaries  wages and employee benefits rents and purchased transportation fuel and fuel taxes depreciation and amortization operating supplies and expenses insurance and claims operating taxes and licenses general and administrative expenses  net of gains communication and utilities total operating expenses operating income interest income interest expense equity in loss of associated companies earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings consolidated operating expenses total operating expenses increased in over  while operating revenues increased 
the combination of the change in these two categories resulted in our operating ratio improving by basis points to in  from in as previously mentioned  increases in revenue per loaded mile  excluding fuel surcharges  and lower casualty and workers compensation claims costs were two of the more significant factors driving these changes 
we also increased the number of ics in our jbt and dcs fleets to  at december   from at the end of when we replace company operated tractors and driver employees with ics  certain costs such as salaries  wages  employee benefits and fuel are reduced and other costs such as purchased transportation increase 
the expense category of salaries  wages and employee benefits declined to of revenue in from in and the total expense dollars only increased from  compared with the increase in revenue 
while we did increase compensation levels for many of our drivers in  these increases were partly offset by lower workers compensation costs 
the number of company drivers at december  was approximately equal to the number at the end of the increase in rents and purchased transportation was primarily due to additional funds paid to railroads and drayage companies  related to jbi business growth  and to the continued expansion of our ic fleets 
fuel cost per gallon was approximately higher in over this increase in fuel costs and slightly lower fuel efficiency accounted for the increase in fuel costs 
we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers that allow us to adjust charges relatively quickly when fuel costs change 
if fuel costs change rapidly  we may experience some financial impact from timing differences between financial reporting periods 
we were able to recover substantially all of our increased fuel costs experienced in calendar year we currently have no contract or derivative programs in place to hedge changes in fuel costs 
the significant decline in insurance and claims expense was primarily due to lower accident and claims experience in as mentioned above  we have made safety a primary focus item throughout our entire organization 
the category of general and administrative expenses includes driver recruiting and testing  legal and professional fees and bad debt expense 
gains and losses on revenue equipment dispositions are also classified in the general and administrative category 
we experienced a net gain of approximately  on revenue equipment and other dispositions in  compared with a million loss in our net interest expense declined to million in from million in we were able to continue reducing our debt and capitalized lease obligations during and paid off all our remaining balance sheet debt and capital leases as of december  our continued improvement in net earnings and strong cash flow allowed us to pay off this debt 
our effective income tax rate was in  compared with in income tax expense in reflects a contingent tax liability of million  including accrued interest expense  related to certain sale leaseback transactions that closed in income tax expense in reflected the reversal of million of non cash tax benefits taken in early  related to these sale leaseback transactions 
see risk factors for additional information on this matter 
our and income tax rates are also higher than statutory federal and state rates  primarily due to our driver per diem plan 
this plan generates net benefits to most of our eligible drivers and to the company 
however  it does result in an increase in our effective income tax rates 
we expect our effective income tax rate to be for the calendar year the equity in loss of associated company item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results for transplace  inc tpi 
effective january   we increased our interest in tpi to approximately  from in jbht s financial exposure is limited to its approximate million investment in tpi since we have not made any additional commitments or guaranteed any of tpi s financial obligations 
compared with overview of our consolidated net earnings for calendar year totaled million  after reversing million of non cash tax benefits  which resulted from a sale and leaseback transaction on intermodal trailing equipment 
this compares with our previous record net earnings of million in diluted earnings per share were in  also a record number  compared with in the average number of diluted shares outstanding in was approximately higher than the comparable number in consolidated operating revenues were billion in  an increase of over the billion in each of our business segments contributed to our improved financial results in while the overall economy and level of freight activity were not particularly strong during  a number of factors contributed to our improved level of earnings 
we continued our focus on capacity management  as well as individual load and lane profitability 
a number of new proprietary technology tools and increased management focus allowed us to reduce the amount of unprofitable lanes and freight  and to properly charge for equipment and services provided to customers 
in addition  significant increases in certain operating costs  such as insurance  fuel and equipment  reduced the level of capacity available in the industry 
jbt segment jbt segment gross revenue was million in  up over the million in higher fuel prices in and the resulting increase in fuel surcharge revenue accounted for this entire level of revenue growth 
the average tractor count in was down nearly from however  revenue per loaded mile  excluding fuel surcharges  rose in  more than offsetting the decline in the size of the fleet and enhancing operating income 
operating income of the jbt segment rose to million in  from million in in addition to the higher revenue per mile  we implemented an accountable expense reimbursement plan driver per diem plan in early this new plan benefited most of our eligible drivers and increased operating income 
jbi segment jbi segment gross revenue grew by  to million in  from million in revenue growth was due  in part  to a strong demand for our unique intermodal service offering which generated an increase in number of loads year over year 
freight mix changes also played an important role that led to improved revenue per load 
operating income in the jbi segment increased to million in from million in the jbi segment operating ratio improved by basis points to for  compared to for these improved financial results were attributable to our investment in upgrading our tractor fleet and adding incremental containers  improved utilization of both drivers and equipment and a concentrated focus on yield management and revenue quality 
dcs segment dcs segment revenue grew approximately to million in from in revenue  net of purchased transportation and fuel surcharge revenue increased 
the increase in revenue occurred even as the business unit s average tractor count for declined approximately  compared to more than offsetting the decline in the tractor fleet was a nearly improvement in revenue excluding fuel surcharge per tractor per day 
driving this increase in productivity was an increase in length of haul of and increased focus on backhaul opportunities 
operating income increased to million in versus million in at the end of  we began analyzing a number of underperforming accounts and identified opportunities to redeploy assets from accounts that did not offer appropriate financial returns on the segment s assets 
at the same time  cost controls were implemented to improve operating results at all accounts 
the success of these efforts improved the operating ratio by basis points  to in cost reductions in driver pay  salary and office wages and associated payroll taxes also enhanced operating income 
a decline of in the average age of the tractor fleet helped reduce maintenance costs and an ongoing commitment to safety contributed to an improvement in the segment s insurance and claims costs 
we also incurred certain new start up costs in associated with several large accounts that did not impact revenue growth will continue to be driven by improvement in productivity and new customer opportunities that provide appropriate financial returns to justify commitment of additional assets 
the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 
percentage of percentage change operating revenue between years vs

the combination of the change in these two categories resulted in our operating ratio improving by basis points to in  from in as previously mentioned  increases in revenue per loaded mile  excluding fuel surcharges  and the implementation of a driver per diem plan were two of the more significant factors driving these changes 
we also increased the number of independent contractors ics in our jbt fleet to at december   from at the end of when we replace company operated tractors and driver employees with ics  certain costs such as salaries  wages  employee benefits and fuel are reduced and other costs such as purchased transportation increase 
fuel cost per gallon was approximately higher in over however  we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers that allow us to adjust charges relatively quickly when fuel costs change 
if fuel costs change rapidly we may experience some financial impact from timing differences between financial reporting periods when fuel costs change more quickly than our compensating fuel surcharges 
we recovered through our fuel surcharge programs substantially all of the increased fuel costs experienced in calendar year we currently have no contracts or derivative programs in place to hedge changes in fuel costs 
insurance and claims costs rose during  primarily due to higher premium costs 
while our accident frequency declined in  severity  or the cost per accident  increased over general and administrative expenses include driver recruiting and testing  bad debts and professional service fees  all of which increased in gains and losses on revenue equipment dispositions are also classified in the general and administrative category 
we had a net loss of approximately million on equipment and other dispositions in  compared with a million loss in these losses were primarily a result of revenue equipment which was lost or written off 
our net interest expense declined to million in  from million in we were able to reduce our total debt levels to million as of december   from million at the end of this reduced debt level was primarily a result of improved earnings and cash flow in and proceeds from a secondary stock offering which closed in mid our effective income tax rate increased to in  from in this higher tax rate was primarily due to our increased level of earnings  the driver per diem plan and a reversal of a million non cash tax benefit taken in related to certain sale leaseback transactions that closed in as previously mentioned  we implemented a driver per diem pay plan in early this plan generates net benefits to most of our eligible drivers and to the company 
however  it does result in an increase in our effective income tax rate 
the million reversal of tax benefits was retroactive to january   and related to a proposed adjustment by the irs that would disallow the tax benefits associated with a series of sale and leaseback transactions  which occurred in this issue is discussed in further detail under risk factors 
the equity in loss of associated company item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results for transplace  inc tpi 
effective january   we increased our interest in tpi to approximately  from in liquidity and capital resources cash flow we generate significant amounts of cash from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in part of the increase in net cash provided from through was a result of our continued improvement in net earnings 
increases in net cash provided have also resulted from deferred income taxes  tax benefits of stock options exercised and higher levels of accrued payroll and other accrued expenses 
some of the significant changes in the trade accounts payable balances which appear on our consolidated statement of cash flows in through were a result of timing differences among years of insurance related payments 
cash flows used in investing activities primarily reflect additions to and dispositions from our fleet of revenue equipment 
the higher level of cash used in investing activities during was due to delayed tractor purchases in early while we were still testing the new epa compliant engines and our decision in late to commence purchasing tractors that were under capital lease arrangements 
we paid million in to purchase tractors which were previously under capital lease programs 
at december   we have no revenue equipment on capital leases 
in  we also purchased approximately million of intermodal trailing equipment that had been under operating lease programs 
net cash used in financing activities during and reflects payments of our remaining debt and capital lease obligations 
our improving cash flows allowed us to close calendar year with no balance sheet debt and no capital lease obligations 
in addition  we re initiated the payment of a cash dividend in early and  in december  announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to 
from 
per share 
we also announced  in december  our intent to purchase up to million of our common stock during the next year 
selected balance sheet data as of december working capital ratio current maturities of long term debt and lease obligations millions total debt and capitalized lease obligations millions total debt to equity total debt as a percentage of total capital from time to time  our board of directors authorizes the repurchase of our common stock 
we did not repurchase any of our common stock during the years through as previously mentioned  the board  in december  authorized the purchase of up to million of our common stock during the next year 
we commenced repurchases of our common stock in january liquidity our need for capital typically has resulted from the acquisition of revenue equipment required to support our growth and the replacement of older revenue equipment with new  late model equipment 
we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions 
we have obtained capital through a secondary common stock offering  revolving lines of credit and cash generated from operations 
we have also periodically utilized capital and operating leases to acquire revenue equipment 
we utilized capital leases to acquire certain tractors in and since late  we have been acquiring tractors and trailing equipment under purchase arrangements and anticipate purchasing our revenue equipment in the foreseeable future 
we are currently committed to spend approximately million  net of expected proceeds from sale or trade in allowances  on revenue equipment and construction of new facilities 
we are authorized to borrow up to million under our current revolving line of credit  which expires november  we had no balances outstanding on this line at december  while we do anticipate some need to borrow on our revolver during  we believe that our liquid assets  cash generated from operations and revolving line of credit will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
our revolving line of credit does not contain ratings triggers that would accelerate payments or amounts due under the agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no remaining capitalized leases at december  our only off balance sheet arrangements are related to our operating leases for trailing equipment and some limited data processing equipment and facilities 
as of december   we had approximately  trailers and  containers chassis that were subject to operating leases  and we had approximately million of obligations remaining under these leases 
our standby letters of credit are also not recorded on our books at december   since there were no balances outstanding at that time under these arrangements 
contractual cash obligations as of december  amounts due by period one year one to four to after total or less three years five years five years operating leases commitments to acquire revenue equipment facilities total financing commitments as of december  commitments expiring by period one year one to four to after total or less three years five years five years revolving credit agreement standby letters of credit total risk factors our business is subject to general economic and business factors that are largely out of our control  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices  excess capacity in the trucking industry  surpluses in the market for used equipment  interest rates  fuel taxes  license and registration fees  insurance premiums  self insurance levels  and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and independent contractors 
we are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers business cycles  particularly in market segments and industries such as retail and manufacturing  where we have a significant concentration of customers 
economic conditions may adversely affect our customers and their ability to pay for our services 
customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss  and we may be required to increase our reserve for bad debt losses 
in addition  our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors 
customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season  and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather  which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs 
we operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry 
numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets 
some of these factors include we compete with many other truck load carriers of varying sizes and  to a lesser extent  with less than truck load carriers and railroads  some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do 
some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business  especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy  which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or maintain our profit margins 
many customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting so called core carriers as approved transportation service providers  and in some instances we may not be selected 
many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs  and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors 
certain of our customers that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations 
the trend toward consolidation in the trucking industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size 
advances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive  and our customers may not be willing to accept higher freight rates to cover the cost of these investments 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers  the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
for the calendar year ended december   our top customers  based on revenue  accounted for approximately of our revenue 
our largest customer is wal mart stores  inc  which accounted for approximately of our total revenue in generally  we do not have long term contracts with our customers  and we cannot assure you that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or that they will continue at the same levels 
a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we depend on third parties in the operation of our business 
our intermodal business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services 
these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads 
while we have agreements with various class i railroads  the majority of our business travels on the burlington northern santa fe and the norfolk southern railroad 
the inability to utilize one or more of these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we also utilize the services of a number of third party dray carriers to perform a significant number of our origin and destination pickups and deliveries 
in addition  a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the united states through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts 
we are currently engaged in an arbitration process with the burlington northern santa fe bnsf railroad to clarify certain financial and operating terms in our joint service agreement jsa 
as previously reported  we are currently engaged in an arbitration process with the burlington northern santa fe bnsf railroad to clarify certain financial and operating terms in our joint service agreement jsa 
bnsf provides a significant amount of rail transportation services to our jbi business segment 
the jsa is an agreement between bnsf and us  which was signed in  and defines a number of financial and operating arrangements relative to our intermodal business 
the jsa specifies arbitration as the method of resolving disagreements if a mediation process does not result in resolution 
we were unable to resolve our differences with bnsf through mediation during the second quarter of the current arbitration process commenced on july  according to the jsa  any amounts due us or payable to bnsf  determined through the arbitration process  could be retroactive to july  both parties have continued to exchange and analyze data during late and early formal arbitration proceedings are currently scheduled for april and may at this time  we are unable to reasonably predict the outcome of this process and  as such  no gain or loss contingency can be determined or recorded 
normal commercial business activity between the parties  including load tendering  load tracing  billing and payments  continues on a timely basis 
difficulty in attracting drivers could affect our profitability and ability to grow 
periodically  the trucking industry experiences substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers  including ics 
a shortage of qualified company drivers and ics has proven to be particularly severe during and in spite of significant increases in driver compensation and recruiting costs  the industry is currently experiencing a significant shortage of drivers 
if we are unable to continue to attract an adequate number of drivers or contract with enough independent contractors  we could be required to significantly increase our driver compensation package or let trucks sit idle  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 
ongoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings 
our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels  which could reduce our earnings 
during  we self insured a portion of our claims exposure resulting from cargo loss  personal injury  property damage and health claims for amounts up to the first million for auto accidents and million for workers compensation 
these deductible limits are the same for if the number or severity of claims for which we are self insured increases  our operating results could be adversely affected 
also  we maintain insurance above the amounts for which we self insure with licensed insurance companies 
insurance carriers have recently raised premiums for most trucking companies 
as a result  our insurance and claims expenses could increase when some of our current coverages expire on july  if these expenses increase  and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates  our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 
the internal revenue service irs has proposed to disallow the tax benefits associated with certain sale and leaseback transactions 
in  we entered into a series of transactions effecting a sale and leaseback of a portion of our intermodal container and chassis fleet for a selling price of approximately million 
this transaction was examined by the irs in an audit of our and tax returns 
in december  we received an irs notice of proposed assessment which disallows the tax benefits associated with these transactions  and as a result  we have filed an appeal in the matter 
we have had preliminary discussions with the irs appeals division and have been informed that the irs examination division has been instructed to prepare additional work since their case had not been developed adequately for the appellate hearing 
to date  we have not been contacted by the irs examination division to provide any additional information for their review 
if a resolution of the matter cannot be reached in the appeals process  the irs will forward a day letter  also known as a notice of deficiency 
a resolution of the dispute could occur at any point in the administrative process or could extend through a trial and court appeals 
if we are unsuccessful in defending this transaction  we could owe additional taxes and interest 
in  after receiving the irs notice of proposed assessment and reviewing applicable accounting literature  we reversed the expected non cash tax benefits of approximately million recognized during  and suspended any further recognition of the benefit 
based on events occurring subsequent to december   we established a reserve for a contingent tax liability of million  including accrued interest expense  which represents all previous tax benefits recognized on these transactions 
the liability for this contingency is included on our consolidated balance sheet at december   as a long term liability 
we continue to believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law for which we received advice and opinions from our external public accountants and attorneys prior to entering into these transactions and we continue to vigorously defend against the irs position using all administrative and legal processes available 
if the irs were successful in disallowing of the tax benefit from this transaction  the total ultimate impact on liquidity could be approximately million  excluding interest 
our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials  underground fuel storage tanks  and discharge and retention of storm water 
we operate in industrial areas  where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located  and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred 
our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage  environmental damage  and hazardous wastes disposal  among others 
we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities 
if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances  or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations  it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations  we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability 
we operate in a highly regulated industry  and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with  or liability for violation of  existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the us department of transportation dot and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business  generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service  equipment operation  safety and financial reporting 
we are audited periodically by the dot to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety  hours of service and other rules and regulations 
if we were found to be out of compliance  the dot could restrict or otherwise impact our operations 
effective january   the fmcsa  an administration within the dot  changed the regulations that govern driver hours of service 
as previously described  these new rules generally allow a driver to drive for up to consecutive hours  rather than  but require hours of off duty time  rather than in addition  more off duty sleeper berth time is required before on duty time is allowed 
the united states court of appeals issued a decision in july  rejecting these new hours of service hos rules 
the court s rejection was based on concerns regarding drivers health  as well as other issues 
on september   the current hos rules were extended for one year or the time at which the fmcsa develops a set of new rules 
on february   the bush administration proposed legislation that would convert the current hos regulations into statutory law  a move that would keep the current rules in effect despite the court of appeals action to overturn them 
as part of a consent decree with the us environmental protection agency epa  a number of heavy duty diesel engine manufacturers agreed to significantly reduce emissions from their engines produced subsequent to october  in november  we ordered approximately  new tractors  primarily for our jbi and dcs fleets  which were equipped with mercedes engines 
these engines were exempt from the epa s october rules 
in late  after extensive testing  we commenced receiving new tractors with the epa compliant engines 
at december   we operated approximately  tractors with the mercedes engines and about  tractors with the epa compliant engines 
in addition to higher initial purchase prices  these new tractors have also experienced an average to reduction in fuel efficiency 
we are uncertain if future maintenance costs will be higher  on the average  for these two groups of tractors as they age 
we do anticipate continued increases in ownership and fuel costs as regular replacement and fleet addition tractors increase the percentage of our fleet with the epa compliant units 
a new set of proposed fuel emission standards mandated by the epa is expected to become effective in we are unable to predict the impact these proposed standards will have on our future operations and financial results 
rapid changes in fuel costs can impact our periodic financial results 
fuel and fuel taxes currently represent our third largest general expense category 
during the past three years  fuel cost per gallon has varied significantly  with prices at times changing as much as 
to 
per gallon between consecutive months 
we have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers  which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs 
most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel 
however  there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers 
in addition  we incur additional costs when fuel prices rise that cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold weather and empty or out of route miles that cannot be billed to customers 
rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
we have a million account receivable from transportacion maritima mexicana tmm related to the sale of our share of a mexican joint venture 
as previously mentioned  we sold our joint venture interest in mexico to tmm during the first quarter of for million 
we have received million in principal and interest payments on this note 
at december   we had a million account receivable from tmm 
we expect to receive these remaining funds during the first quarter of recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb revised fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
interpretation no 
r addresses consolidation by business enterprises of certain variable interest entities 
for public entities that are not small business issuers  the provisions of interpretation no 
r are effective no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after march  if the variable interest entity is considered to be a special purpose entity  interpretation no 
r shall be applied no later than the first reporting period that ends after december  the adoption of this interpretation did not have any material effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets 
this statement amends the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
apb provided an exception to the basic measurement principle fair value for exchanges of similar assets  requiring that some nonmonetary exchanges be recorded on a carryover basis 
sfas eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance  that is  transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exchanges of nonmonetary assets occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  as of december   we believe that sfas will have no significant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  the cost will be based on the grant date fair value of the award and will be recognized over the period for which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
for public entities that do not file as small business issuers  the provisions of the revised statement are to be applied prospectively for awards that are granted  modified  or settled in the first interim or annual period beginning after june  when we adopt the standard on july   we will be required to report in our financial statements the share based compensation expense for the last six months of and may adopt it using the modified prospective method effective july  we are currently evaluating the impact sfas no 
r will have on us and based on our preliminary analysis  expect to report approximately million of additional compensation expense during the period july   through december   as a result of this new accounting standard 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of our issuance of short term debt 
we from time to time have utilized interest rate swaps to mitigate the effects of interest rate changes  none were outstanding at december  risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in short term market interest rates 
if short term market interest rates average more during the next months  there would be no material adverse impact on our results of operations based on the fact that we had no variable rate debt outstanding at december  at december   we also had no long term debt obligations outstanding 
although we conduct business in foreign countries  international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
additionally  foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december  accordingly  we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production  seasonality  weather and other market factors 
historically  we have been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
we cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations
