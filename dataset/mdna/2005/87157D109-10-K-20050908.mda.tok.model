item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements and factors that may affect results you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom designed user interface solutions that enable people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of mobile computing  communications  entertainment  and other electronic devices 
from our inception in through fiscal  we were a development stage company  which focused on developing and refining our pattern recognition and capacitive sensing technologies  and generated revenue by providing contract engineering and design services 
in fiscal  we began shipping our proprietary touchpad and are now the world s leading supplier of interface solutions to the notebook computer market and the hdd portable digital music player market 
in fiscal  we believe we were the market leader in providing interface solutions for notebook computers and hdd portable digital music players 
we believe our market share results from the combination of our customer focus  the strength of our intellectual property  and our engineering know how  which allow us to design products that meet the demanding design specifications of oems 
in april  we began shipping our initial dual pointing solution for notebook computers  which included third party products  enabling pc oems to offer end users the combination of both a touch pad and a pointing stick 
in january  we achieved our first design win incorporating our proprietary pointing stick solution  touchstyk  into a dual pointing application for use in a notebook computer and began shipping them in volume in the december quarter 
with our touchstyk  we offer oems the choice of a touch pad  a pointing stick  or a combination of both of our proprietary interface solutions for dual pointing applications 
we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or title has transferred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a compound annual growth rate of approximately 
in fiscal  we derived of our product revenue from the personal computer market 
by fiscal  revenue from the personal computer market had decreased to of our net revenue 
in june  we acquired nsm technology limited  or nsm  a hong kong company 
the acquisition of nsm provided us with a highly skilled and experienced work force to expand our global presence and infrastructure to support customers in the asia pacific region 
many of our customers are migrating their manufacturing operations from taiwan to china  and our oem customers are beginning to establish design centers in that region 
with our expanded global presence  including offices in taiwan  hong kong  and china  we are better positioned to provide local sales  operations  and engineering support services to our existing customers  as well as potential new customers  within the asia pacific region 

table of contents our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements  eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories 
this approach requires us to work closely with our manufacturing subcontractors to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements 
we provide our manufacturing subcontractors with six month rolling forecasts and issue purchase orders based on our anticipated requirements for the next days 
however  we do not have any long term supply contracts with any of our manufacturing subcontractors 
currently  we use three third party manufacturers to provide our proprietary capacitive based asics  and in certain cases  we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products 
our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products  including materials  manufacturing  and assembly costs paid to third party manufacturers and related overhead costs associated with our manufacturing operations personnel 
additionally  all warranty costs and any inventory provisions or write downs are charged to cost of revenue 
our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our customers products in meeting their custom design requirements and our ongoing cost improvement programs 
these cost improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements 
our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products  which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost improvement programs 
as a result  new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin 
our research and development expenses include expenses related to product development  engineering  materials costs  patent expenses  and the costs incurred to design interface solutions for customers prior to the customers commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products 
these expenses have generally increased  reflecting our continuing commitment to the technological and design innovation required to maintain a leadership position in our existing markets and to develop new technologies for new markets 
selling  general  and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales  marketing  and administrative personnel  sarbanes oxley act compliance  internal sales and outside sales representatives commissions  market research and consulting  and other marketing and sales activities 
these expenses have generally increased  primarily reflecting increased corporate governance costs related to sarbanes oxley act compliance  staffing  commission expense associated with higher revenue levels  and additional management personnel in anticipation of our continued growth in our existing markets and penetration into new markets 
in connection with the grant of stock options to our employees and consultants  we have recorded deferred stock compensation  representing the difference between the deemed fair value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes and the exercise price of these options at the dates of grant 
deferred stock compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is amortized on a straight line basis over the applicable vesting period 
options granted are typically subject to a four year vesting period 
we are amortizing the deferred stock compensation over the vesting periods of the applicable options 
we recorded expense associated with deferred stock compensation of approximately   and  in fiscal   and  respectively 
upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment fas r in fiscal  we will no longer amortize deferred stock compensation  as fas r will require us to expense stock options based on grant date fair value 
the adoption of fas r will have no effect on our cash flows  but is expected to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  cost of revenue  inventories  product warranty  provision for income taxes  income taxes payable  intangible assets  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  applicable laws  and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents the methods  estimates  interpretations  and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies can have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements 
the securities and exchange commission considers an entity s most critical accounting policies to be those policies that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and those that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain when estimated 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or title has transferred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we accrue for estimated sales returns and other allowances  based on historical experience  at the time we recognize revenue  which is typically upon shipment 
we record contract revenue for research and development as the services are provided under the terms of the contract 
we recognize non refundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist and for which there is no continuing involvement by us on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to meet their financial obligations 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances in which we are aware of a specific customer s potential inability to meet its financial obligation  we record a specific reserve of the bad debt against amounts due 
in addition  we make judgments and estimates on the collectibility of accounts receivable based on our historical bad debt experience  customers creditworthiness  current economic trends  recent changes in customers payment trends  and deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position 
if circumstances change adversely  additional bad debt allowances may be required 
inventory we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we base our assessment of the ultimate realization of inventories on our projections of future demand and market conditions 
sudden declines in demand  rapid product improvements  or technological changes  or any combination of these factors  can cause us to have excess or obsolete inventories 
on an ongoing basis  we review for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their net realizable value based upon our forecasts of future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts  additional inventory reserves may be required 
the following factors influence our estimates changes to or cancellations of customer orders  unexpected decline in demand  rapid product improvements and technological advances  and termination or changes by our oem customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions 
periodically  we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers when a customer s delivery schedule is delayed or a customer s order is cancelled 
in those circumstances we consider whether a write down is required to reduce the carrying value of the inventory purchased to its net realizable value 
product warranties we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  materials usage  rework  and delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
we exercise judgment in determining the estimates underlying our accrued warranty liability 
the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our operating results if the actual rate of unit failure or the associated costs of repair or replacement are greater than what we used in estimating the accrued warranty liability 

table of contents income taxes we recognize federal  state  and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the then current fiscal year for each tax jurisdiction 
we also recognize federal  state  and foreign deferred tax liabilities or assets for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence and our judgment  are not expected to be realized 
if our assumptions  and consequently our estimates  change in the future  the valuation allowance we have established for our deferred tax assets may be changed  which could impact income tax expense 
we account for income tax contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we believe we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes in connection with the resolution of income tax contingencies 
however  our results have in the past  and could in the future  include favorable and unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period an assessment is made or resolved or upon the expiration of a statute of limitation 
accordingly  our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter 
in our first quarter of fiscal  we will adopt fas r and expense the grant date fair value of stock options 
in connection with the expensing of the grant date fair value of stock options  we will set up deferred tax benefit on the option expense associated with nonqualified stock options  but under current tax accounting standards can not set up deferred tax benefit for the option expense associated with qualified stock options 
for qualified stock options we will record tax benefit only in the event of a future period disqualifying disposition of the underlying stock by employees 
accordingly  as we can not record tax benefit for the option expense associated with qualified stock options until the occurrence of a future disqualifying disposition of the underlying stock by employees  our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates will be subject to greater volatility and our ability to reasonably estimate our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates will be negatively impacted as a result of our adoption of fas r

operating income 
we generated operating income of million  or of net revenue  for the year ended june  compared with million  or of net revenue  for the year ended june  as discussed in the preceding paragraphs  the improvement in operating income was primarily a result of the increased operating leverage from the increase in net revenue as both research and development and selling  general  and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of net revenue as well as the higher gross margin percentage 
interest income 
interest income was million for the year ended june  compared with million for the year ended june  the million increase in interest income resulted from a combination of substantially higher average invested cash balances and higher average interest rates

no further shares will be repurchased under this program 
bank credit facility 
we currently maintain a million working capital line of credit with silicon valley bank

in connection with issuing the notes  we incurred debt issuance costs of million  consisting primarily of the initial purchasers discount and costs related to legal  accounting  and printing  which will be amortized over five years 
we expect to use the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes and potentially for future acquisitions 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum payable on december and june of each year  beginning june   which represents an annual debt service cost of approximately  however  we will pay additional contingent interest on the notes if the average trading price of the notes is at or above of the principal amount of the notes for a specified period beginning with the six month period commencing december  the amount of contingent interest payable on the notes with respect to a six month period  for which contingent interest applies  will equal per annum of the average trading price of the notes for a specified five trading day period preceding such six month period 
we are also obligated to file and maintain a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission covering resales by the holders of the notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes

on june   our registration statement for these securities was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission see million shelf registration below 
while we do not expect a registration default to occur requiring us to pay additional interest  we cannot assure you that a registration default will not occur in the future 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock  initially at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  or a total of  shares of common stock  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock subject to adjustment in certain events 
the denominator of the diluted net income per share calculation includes the weighted average effect of the  shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes 
through november   upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the notes  we could potentially be obligated to issue up to shares per  of principal amount of notes  or a total of  shares of common stock  which is equivalent to a conversion price of per share of common stock 
the additional  shares  contingently issuable upon a fundamental change  are not included in the calculation of diluted net income per share 
the notes may be converted if  during any calendar quarter commencing after december   the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to of the applicable conversion price on such last trading day  on or after january   if we have called the notes for redemption  or during prescribed periods  upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions or fundamental changes 
on or after december   we may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest and additional interest  if any 
noteholders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash on december   december   and december  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest and additional interest  if any 
upon conversion of the notes  in lieu of delivering common stock  we may  at our discretion  deliver cash or a combination of cash and common stock 
as of june   none of the conditions for conversion of the notes were satisfied 
the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations and rank junior in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness  equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future indebtedness or other obligations that are not  by their terms  either senior or subordinated to the notes  including trade debt and other general unsecured obligations that do not constitute senior or subordinated indebtedness  and senior in right of payment to all of our future indebtedness that  by its terms  is subordinated to the notes 
there are no financial covenants in the notes 

table of contents note payable to a related party 
the long term note payable of million to national semiconductor corporation national represents limited recourse debt that is secured solely by a portion of our stockholdings in foveon  inc foveon  in which national is also an investor 
we do not anticipate making any payments under the limited recourse loan with national  either prior to or at maturity  unless foveon is participating in a liquidity event  such as an initial public offering of its equity securities or a merger  through which we would receive amounts in excess of our million long term note payable plus accrued interest expense 
million shelf registration 
we have registered an aggregate of million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions  which shares generally will be freely tradeable after their issuance under rule of the securities act  unless held by an affiliate of the acquired company  in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of rule million shelf registration 
we have registered an aggregate of million of our convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes 
the shares issued upon conversion generally will be freely tradeable after their issuance under rule of the securities act  unless held by an affiliate  in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of rule liquidity and capital resources 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances and anticipated cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements over the course of the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  costs related to protecting our intellectual property  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity  the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions  our common stock repurchase program  and the amount and timing of our investments in  or acquisitions of  other technologies or companies 
we cannot assure you that further equity or debt financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to take advantage of unexpected business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth a summary of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of june  in millions payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years convertible senior subordinated notes note payable building leases total our convertible senior subordinated notes include a provision allowing the noteholders to require us  at the noteholders discretion  to repurchase their notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest and additional interest  if any on december   december   and december  and in the event of a fundamental change as described in the indenture governing the notes 
the early repayment of the notes is not reflected in the above schedule  but if all the noteholders elected to exercise their rights to require us to repurchase their notes on december   then our contractual obligations for the years period would be increased by million with a corresponding decrease in amounts due in more than years
