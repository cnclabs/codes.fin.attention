item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business description and overview badger meter is a leading marketer and manufacturer of products using flow measurement and control technologies developed both internally and with other technology companies 
its products are used to measure and control the flow of liquids in a variety of applications 
the company s product lines fall into two general categories  utility and industrial 
two product lines  residential and commercial water meters with various meter reading technology systems  are generally sold to water utilities and constitute a majority of the company s sales 
industrial product line sales comprise the remainder of the company s sales and include automotive fluid meters and systems  small precision valves  electromagnetic meters  impeller flow meters and industrial process meters all with related accessories and instrumentation 
residential and commercial water meters and related systems are classified as local or manual read meters or automatic meter reading amr products 
local read meters consist of a water meter and a register 
with amr meters  the register digitally encodes the mechanical reading and its radio frequency transmitter 
table of contents communicates the data to a computerized system that collects the data and sends it to specific utility computerized programs 
net sales and the corresponding net earnings depend on unit volume and mix of products  with the company generally earning higher margins on amr products 
there is a base level of annual business for these products driven by replacement units and  to a lesser extent  housing starts 
sales above the base level depend on conversions to amr 
the company believes that conversion from local read meters to amr products can accelerate replacements of meters and result in growth  because it is estimated that only of the water meter market has been converted to amr 
badger meter s strategy is to solve customers metering needs with its proprietary meter reading systems or other systems available through alliances within the marketplace 
the industrial products generally serve niche markets and have in the past utilized technology derived from utility products to serve industrial uses 
as these markets evolve  these products are becoming more specialized to meet industrial flow measurement and communication protocol requirements 
serving these markets allows the company to expand its technologies into other areas of flow measurement and control  as well as utilizing existing capacity and spreading fixed costs over a larger sales base 
results of operations in the second quarter of  the company completed two acquisitions  data industrial corporation dic and mecaplus equipements sa mpe 
through the acquisition of dic  the company acquired an impeller flow meter allowing it to serve a market not previously served 
the acquisition of mpe allowed the company to expand into the lubrication system market in france while continuing to have a market for its automotive fluid meters 
these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase accounting method  and as a result  some of the variances shown since december  were attributable to having a full year s results in the acquisitions are further discussed in part ii  item of this annual report on form k under the heading financial statements and supplementary data under note b acquisitions of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
net sales badger meter s net sales of million increased million  or  for compared to the increase was the result of sales increases in each of the company s product lines as further discussed below 
water meter sales are influenced by a continued industry movement away from manual read meters to amr technologies  the lengthening of the sales cycle and the financial budget conditions of the various water utilities served 
amr revenues include sales of third party technologies  as well as the company s proprietary orion technology 
customers include independent distributors  large cities  private water companies and numerous smaller municipal water utilities 
one group of the company s sales representatives focuses on distributors  another on large accounts public and private  and a third group focuses on the remaining customers 
residential and commercial water meter net sales represented of total net sales in compared with in these sales increased million in to million from million in unit volume increased in meters utilizing amr technologies offset by a slight decline in local or manual read meters 
amr technologies carry a higher price  which also contributed to the increase in net sales 
in addition  net sales included a significant increase over levels for the sales volumes of orion  the company s proprietary amr system introduced in industrial sales are affected by economic conditions  domestically and internationally  in each of the markets served by the various product lines 
in  these markets slowly began to improve 
in total  the industrial products represented of total net sales in compared to in industrial product sales increased to million in compared with million in all of the product lines showed growth over the levels  partially due to the effects of the strengthening euro 
international sales are comprised primarily of sales of small valves and automotive fluid meters and systems in europe  sales of water meters and related technologies in latin america  and sales of valves and other 
table of contents metering products throughout the world 
in europe  sales are made in both us dollars and euros 
most other international sales are made in us dollars 
the company was able to partially hedge its euro exposure by holding euro denominated debt 
international sales increased to million in from million in due principally to the effects of the strengthening euro 
without the effects from foreign exchange  sales increased due to higher sales in mexico offset somewhat by lower european sales 
net sales in and included million and million of sales  respectively  related to the acquired companies compared to million in  with the latter amount representing sales only from the dates of the acquisitions 
without the acquisitions  net sales for increased million  or  over net sales 
residential and commercial water meter net sales represented of total sales in compared with in these sales increased million in to million compared to million in while the number of units utilizing the company s principal amr technologies increased  overall unit volume declined due to lower volumes of local or manual read water meters 
amr technologies carry a higher price  which contributed to the increase in net sales 
in addition  the increase in net sales included sales of the newly introduced orion amr system 
sales for the year were negatively influenced by longer sales cycles  particularly early in as water utilities evaluated the requirements and costs of increased security resulting from concerns over the war in iraq and terrorism 
industrial sales are affected by economic conditions  domestically and internationally  in each of the markets served by the company s various product lines 
in total  the industrial products represented of total net sales in compared with in industrial product sales increased to million in compared with million in much of this increase is attributable to the two acquisitions completed in the second quarter of and to the effect of the stronger euro on sales in europe 
without the acquisitions  the net change would be an increase of million  or  primarily due to the strengthening of the euro resulting in higher sales of automotive fluid meters and electromagnetic flow meters 
international sales  excluding the effects of the acquisitions  increased to million from million in due to increased sales into latin america 
gross margins gross margins were  and for  and  respectively 
gross margins were flat between and as a result of a higher mix of amr sales and better plant capacity utilization offset by increased obsolete inventory reserves and higher metal and resin commodity prices 
the decrease between and was primarily due to lower unit volumes resulting in higher absorbed factory costs  the inability to increase prices for higher incurred costs due to market conditions  and to a lesser extent  the acquisition of mpe which has lower margins as an assembly operation 
operating expenses selling  engineering and administration costs increased in over levels 
overall  inflationary increases were mitigated somewhat by cost savings generated by the consolidation of two of the company s domestic facilities and a continuing emphasis on cost control 
selling  engineering and administration costs increased in over levels 
some of the increase was attributable to the full year effects in of the prior year acquisitions  and severance costs for headcount reductions at mpe to better position it in the market 
without the effects of the acquisitions and the headcount reduction costs  these expenses increased primarily due to increased health care expenses offset somewhat by continuing cost control efforts 
interest expense interest expense decreased  in compared to due to higher cost long term debt being replaced with lower cost short term debt 
the company sold commercial paper at favorable interest rates resulting in overall lower interest costs 
interest expense decreased  in compared to primarily 
table of contents due to continuing favorable interest rates on the commercial paper the company used to finance its operations in  as well as the reduction in overall debt from prior year levels 
other expense income  net other expense income  net in was an expense of million versus income of million in the amount included million of foreign exchange loss compared to an exchange gain of million in the exchange loss was due to the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar and its effects on the company s foreign subsidiaries 
the gain related to the company s euro based receivables on its corporate ledger from its foreign subsidiaries  for which translation gain was recognized through the income statement while the offsetting translation loss on the corresponding subsidiary s debt was recognized as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
the significant strengthening of the euro in resulted in the translation gain 
during the second quarter of  the company borrowed euro based debt domestically to hedge that euro based receivable exposure 
income taxes income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes were  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in from was primarily due to increased federal and state tax rates applied to the increased net earnings  and an increased valuation reserve on the operating losses of the company s french subsidiary  as further described below 
the increase in from was primarily due to an increased valuation reserve on the operating losses of certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
in  the company determined that there were excess reserves for prior year taxes  and accordingly reduced tax expense by  at the same time  the company concluded that it was not certain that net operating loss carryforwards for certain foreign subsidiaries would be realized through future profits  and as such a  valuation reserve was created by increasing the tax expense 
the net result of these transactions did not significantly affect the effective tax rate for in and  the valuation reserves were increased to  and  respectively  due to continued realization uncertainties for foreign net operating loss carryforwards in france 
the increases in the reserves were recorded as additional tax expense  which significantly increased the company s effective rate for both and at december   the company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards at certain european subsidiaries totaling million 
the carryforwards have unlimited carryforward periods  which can be used to offset future taxable income at these locations 
net earnings and earnings per share as a result of the above mentioned items  net earnings were   and  in  and  respectively 
on a diluted basis  adjusted for the for stock split paid december   earnings per share were  and  respectively  for the same periods 
liquidity and capital resources the main sources of liquidity for the company are cash from operations and borrowing capacity 
cash provided by operations in was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the decrease was the net result of a million payment to the pension plan  increases in receivables and inventory levels  and reduced payables  offset somewhat by increased net earnings 
cash provided by operations in increased million  or  compared to primarily as a result of increased earnings and no required payment to the pension plan  offset by increases in receivables and inventories 
receivables increased between december  and due primarily to slightly higher fourth quarter sales and also to a slight increase in the number of days sales outstanding 
inventories increased due primarily to the introduction of several new products in  as well as longer lead times on certain 
table of contents electronic components associated with the increased sales of amr products 
the increases in both receivables and inventories were affected to a lesser extent by the strength of the euro on foreign subsidiaries balances 
capital expenditures totaled million in  million in and million in these amounts vary due to the timing of capital expenditures 
the company believes capacity exists to increase production levels with minimal additional capital expenditures 
prepaid pension increased million at the end of compared to the same period in this was the result of pension expense of million and a payment of million during assumptions for determining pension liability  expected return on assets and annual expense are reviewed and  if appropriate  adjusted annually 
the impacts of hypothetical changes in certain assumptions is difficult to determine as economic factors can often impact multiple assumptions and inputs at the same time 
the company believes its current assumptions are reasonable 
at december   the market value of the assets in the company s pension plan was million 
included in the company s december  prepaid pension balance was million of unrecognized net actuarial losses 
the amount of net goodwill recorded at december  and was  and  respectively 
the net increase of  was due to the strengthening of the euro  offset by a reduction in goodwill of  due to the reversal of the remaining amount of unused severance costs related to the termination of several mpe employees originally recorded in connection with the mpe acquisition 
short term debt increased million in due to the use of commercial paper to replace long term debt as payments were required and to support normal operating needs 
commercial paper was obtained at interest rates lower than the long term debt rates 
the decrease in payables between years is primarily the result of the timing of purchases and a significant inflow of inventory in december accrued compensation and employee benefits increased million due to increased incentive costs associated with improved sales and earnings levels 
income and other taxes decreased million as a result of the timing of tax payments 
total outstanding long term debt both the current and long term portions decreased million as a result of required payments and the company taking advantage of lower short term rates to replace higher cost long term debt 
none of the company s debt carries financial covenants or is collateralized 
common stock and capital in excess of par value both increased during due to stock issued in connection with the exercise of stock options and treasury stock issuances 
employee benefit stock decreased by  due to shares released as a result of payments made on the essop loan 
treasury stock increased due to shares repurchased during the year 
badger meter s financial condition remains strong 
the company believes that its operating cash flows  available borrowing capacity including  of unused credit lines  and its ability to raise capital provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements  future capital expenditures and development of new products 
the company continues to take advantage of its local commercial paper market and from time to time will convert short term debt into long term debt 
off balance sheet arrangements the company guarantees the debt of the badger meter officers voting trust bmovt  from which the trust obtained loans from a bank on behalf of the officers of the company in order to purchase shares of the company s common stock 
the officers loan amounts are collateralized by the company s shares that were purchased with the loans proceeds 
there have been no loans made to officers by the bmovt since july the company has guaranteed  and  of the trust s debt at december  and  respectively 
the current loan matures in april  at which time it is expected to be renewed 
the fair market value of this guarantee at december  continues to be insignificant because the collateral value of the shares exceeds the loan amount 
the company has no other off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents contractual obligations the company guarantees the outstanding debt of the badger meter employee savings and stock ownership plan essop that is recorded in long term debt  offset by a similar amount of unearned compensation that has been recorded as a reduction of shareholders equity 
the loan amount is collateralized by shares of the company s common stock 
payments of  and  in and  respectively  reduced the loan to  at december  the terms of the loan allow variable payments of principal with the final principal and interest payment due in april  at which time it is expected to be renewed 
the following table includes the company s significant contractual obligations as of december  there are no other undisclosed guarantees 
payments due by period less than total year years in thousands current portion and long term debt capital lease obligations essop royalty commitments minimum product purchases operating leases other distribution rights and research and development commitments total contractual obligations as of december   the company had no material purchase obligations other than those created in the ordinary course of business related to inventory and property  plant and equipment  which generally have terms of less than days 
the company also has long term obligations related to its pension and postretirement plans which are discussed in detail in note employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
as of the most recent actuarial measurement date  no pension plan contributions are anticipated in and postretirement medical claims are paid as they are submitted 
postretirement medical claims are anticipated to be  in  however  these amounts can vary significantly from year to year because the company is self insured 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
as discussed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles generally requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company s more significant estimates relate primarily to several judgmental reserves allowance for doubtful accounts  allowance for obsolete inventories  warranty and after sale costs reserve  and the health care reserve 
each of these judgmental reserves is evaluated quarterly and is reviewed with the company s disclosure committee and the audit and compliance committee of the board of directors 
the basis for the reserve amounts is determined by analyzing the minimum and maximum amount of anticipated exposure for each account  and then selecting the most appropriate amount within the range based upon historical experience and various other considerations that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this method has been used for all years in the presented financials and has been used consistently throughout each year 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the criteria used for calculating each of the reserve amounts varies by type of reserve 
for the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve  significant past due balances are reviewed in conjunction with applying historical 
table of contents write off ratios to the remaining balances 
the calculation for the allowance for obsolete inventories reserve is determined by analyzing the relationship between the age and quantity of items on hand versus estimated usage to determine if excess quantities exist 
the calculation for warranty and after sale costs reserve uses criteria that includes known potential problems on past sales as well as historical claims ratios for current sales and current warranty trends 
the health care reserve is determined by using medical cost trend analyses  reviewing subsequent payments made and estimating unbilled amounts 
the changes in the balances of these reserves at december  compared to the prior year were due to normal business conditions and are not deemed to be significant 
while the company continually tries to improve its estimates  no significant changes in the underlying processes are expected in future periods 
other matters the company believes it is in compliance with the various environmental statutes and regulations to which the company s domestic and international operations are subject 
currently  the company is in the process of resolving issues relative to two landfill sites 
provision has been made for all known settlement costs  which are not material 
the company is also a defendant in a number of multi party asbestos lawsuits pending in various state courts 
these lawsuits assert claims alleging that certain industrial products were manufactured by the defendants and were the cause of injury and harm 
the company is vigorously defending itself against these alleged claims 
although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters  the company does not believe the ultimate resolution of these issues will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  either from a cash flow perspective or on the financial statements as a whole 
market risks in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to various market risks  including commodity prices  foreign currency rates and interest rates 
the company typically does not hold or issue derivative instruments and has a policy specifically prohibiting the use of such instruments for trading purposes 
commodity risk is managed by keeping abreast of economic conditions and locking in purchase prices for quantities that correspond to the company s forecasted usage 
the company s foreign currency risk relates to the sales of products to foreign customers  specifically european customers  as most other foreign sales are made in us dollars 
the company uses lines of credit with us and european banks to offset currency exposure related to european receivables and other monetary assets 
as of december  and  the company s foreign currency net monetary assets were substantially offset by comparable debt resulting in no material exposure 
the company s short term debt on december  was floating rate debt with market values approximating carrying value 
fixed rate debt was principally a us dollar term loan with a interest rate and a euro dollar revolving term loan with a interest rate 
for the short term floating rate debt  future annual interest costs will fluctuate based upon short term interest rates 
for the short term debt on hand on december   the effect of a change in interest rates is approximately  before income taxes
