item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
risk factors cautionary statement on forward looking statements we have made and will make forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of in our annual report  in this annual report on form k and in other contexts relating to future growth and profitability targets and strategies designed to increase total shareholder value 
forward looking statements also include  but are not limited to  information regarding our future economic and financial condition  the plans and objectives of our management and our assumptions regarding our performance and these plans and objectives 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information  so long as those statements are 
table of contents identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
we desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of that act 
some forward looking statements that we make in our annual report  in this annual report on form k and in other contexts represent challenging goals for our company  and the achievement of these goals is subject to a variety of risks and assumptions and numerous factors beyond our control 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements we make are described below 
all forward looking statements attributable to us or persons working on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the following cautionary statements 
products perceptions that the products we produce and market are not safe could adversely affect us and contribute to the risk we will be subjected to legal action 
we manufacture and market a number of complex chemical products  such as fertilizers  growing media  herbicides and pesticides  bearing our brand names 
on occasion  allegations are made that some of our products have failed to perform up to expectations or have caused damage or injury to individuals or property 
based on reports of contamination at a third party supplier s vermiculite mine  the public may perceive that some of our products manufactured in the past using vermiculite are or may also be contaminated 
public perception that our products are not safe  whether justified or not  could impair our reputation  involve us in litigation  damage our brand names and have a material adverse affect on our business 
weather and seasonality weather conditions in north america and europe can have a significant impact on the timing of sales in the spring selling season and overall annual sales 
an abnormally wet and or cold spring throughout north america or europe could adversely affect both fertilizer and pesticide sales and  therefore  our financial results 
because our products are used primarily in the spring and summer  our business is highly seasonal 
for the past three fiscal years  more than of our net sales have occurred in the second and third fiscal quarters combined 
our working capital needs and borrowings peak toward the end of our second fiscal quarter because we are incurring expenditures in preparation for the spring selling season while the majority of our revenue collections occur in our third fiscal quarter 
if cash on hand is insufficient to pay our obligations as they come due  including interest payments or operating expenses  at a time when we are unable to draw on our credit facility  this seasonality could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business 
adverse weather conditions could heighten this risk 
competition each of our segments participates in markets that are highly competitive 
many of our competitors sell their products at prices lower than ours  and we compete primarily on the basis of product quality  product performance  value  brand strength  supply chain competency and advertising 
some of our competitors have significant financial resources 
the strong competition that we face in all of our markets may prevent us from achieving our revenue goals  which may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
customer concentration north america segment net sales represented approximately of our worldwide net sales in fiscal our top three north american retail customers together accounted for of our north america segment fiscal net sales and of our outstanding accounts receivable as of september  home depot  wal mart and lowe s represented approximately  and  respectively  of our fiscal north america net sales 
the loss of  or reduction in orders from  home depot  wal mart  lowe s or any other significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial results  as could customer disputes regarding shipments  fees  merchandise condition or related matters 
our inability to collect accounts receivable from any of these customers could also have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we do not have long term sales agreements or other contractual assurances as to future sales to any of our major retail customers 
in addition  continued consolidation in the retail industry has resulted in an increasingly concentrated retail base 
to the extent such concentration continues to occur  our net sales and income from operations may be increasingly sensitive to deterioration in the financial condition of  or other adverse developments involving our relationship with  one or more customers 
significant agreement if we were to commit a serious default under the marketing agreement with monsanto for consumer roundup products  monsanto may have the right to terminate the agreement 
if monsanto were to terminate the marketing agreement for cause  we would not be entitled to any termination fee  and we would lose all  or a significant portion  of the significant source of earnings and overhead expense absorption the marketing agreement provides 
monsanto may also be able to terminate the marketing agreement within a given region  including north america  without paying us a termination fee if sales to consumers in that region decline over a cumulative three fiscal year period  or by more than for each of two consecutive years 
debt we have a significant amount of debt that could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under outstanding indebtedness and otherwise  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flows from operating activities to payments on our indebtedness  which would reduce the cash flows available to fund working capital  capital expenditures  advertising  research and development efforts and other general corporate requirements  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  limit our ability to borrow additional funds  and expose us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because some of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividends and the planned five year stock repurchase plan will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to some extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  on or before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our credit facility contains restrictive covenants and cross default provisions that require us to maintain specified financial ratios 
our ability to satisfy those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot be assured we will satisfy those ratios 
a breach of any of these financial ratio covenants or other covenants could result in a default 
upon the occurrence of an event of default  the lenders could elect to declare the applicable outstanding indebtedness due immediately and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
we cannot be sure that our lenders would waive a default or that we could pay the indebtedness in full if it were accelerated 

table of contents equity ownership concentration hagedorn partnership  lp beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common shares as of december   and has sufficient voting power to significantly influence the election of directors and the approval of other actions requiring the approval of our shareholders 
regulatory and environmental local  state  federal and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters affect us in several ways 
in the united states  all products containing pesticides must be registered with the us epa and similar state agencies before they can be sold 
the inability to obtain or the cancellation of any such registration could have an adverse effect on our business  the severity of which would depend on the products involved  whether another product could be substituted and whether our competitors were similarly affected 
we attempt to anticipate regulatory developments and maintain registrations of  and access to  substitute active ingredients  but there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to avoid or minimize these risks 
the food quality protection act  enacted by the us congress in august  establishes a standard for food use pesticides  which standard is the reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the cumulative effect of pesticide exposures 
under this act  the us epa is evaluating the cumulative risks from dietary and non dietary exposures to pesticides 
the pesticides in our products  certain of which may be used on crops processed into various food products  are typically manufactured by independent third parties and continue to be evaluated by the us epa as part of this exposure risk assessment 
the us epa or the third party registrant may decide that a pesticide we use in our products will be limited or made unavailable to us 
for example  in december  the us epa reached agreement with various parties  including manufacturers of the active ingredient diazinon  regarding a phased withdrawal from retailers by december of residential uses of products containing diazinon  also used in our lawn and garden products 
we cannot predict the outcome or the severity of the effect of their continuing evaluations 
in addition  the use of certain pesticide and fertilizer products is regulated by various local  state  federal and foreign environmental and public health agencies 
these regulations may include requirements that only certified or professional users apply the product or that certain products be used only on certain types of locations  may require users to post notices on properties to which products have been or will be applied  may require notification to individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the future or may ban the use of certain ingredients 
even if we are able to comply with all such regulations and obtain all necessary registrations  we cannot assure you that our products  particularly pesticide products  will not cause injury to the environment or to people under all circumstances 
the costs of compliance  remediation or products liability have adversely affected operating results in the past and could materially affect future quarterly or annual operating results 
the harvesting of peat for our growing media business has come under increasing regulatory and environmental scrutiny 
in the united states  state regulations frequently require us to limit our harvesting and to restore the property to an agreed upon condition 
in some locations  we have been required to create water retention ponds to control the sediment content of discharged water 
in the united kingdom  our peat extraction efforts are also the subject of legislation 
in addition to the regulations already described  local  state  federal and foreign agencies regulate the disposal  handling and storage of waste  air and water discharges from our facilities 
the adequacy of our current environmental reserves and future provisions is based on our operating in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and public health laws and regulations and several significant assumptions that we have identified all of the significant sites that must be remediated  that there are no significant conditions of potential contamination that are unknown to us  and that with respect to the agreed judicial consent order in ohio  the potentially contaminated soil can be remediated in place rather than having to be removed and only specific stream segments will require remediation as opposed to the entire stream 

table of contents if there is a significant change in the facts and circumstances surrounding these assumptions or if we are found not to be in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and public health laws and regulations  it could have a material impact on future environmental capital expenditures and other environmental expenses and our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
european economic conditions and foreign currency exposures we currently operate manufacturing  sales and service facilities outside of north america  particularly in the united kingdom  germany  france and the netherlands 
in fiscal  international net sales accounted for approximately of our total net sales 
accordingly  we are subject to risks associated with operations in foreign countries  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  limitations on the remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries  additional costs of compliance with local regulations  and historically  in certain countries  higher rates of inflation than in the united states 
in addition  our operations outside the united states are subject to the risk of new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions  potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations and potentially adverse tax consequences 
the costs related to our international operations could adversely affect our operations and financial results in the future 
restructuring activities in june  we commenced a long term strategic improvement plan  focused on improving organizational effectiveness  implementing better business processes and reducing selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses 
this reorganization places significant pressure on many s  g a functions to reduce headcount and streamline activities 
while management believes these efforts will ultimately generate even stronger financial results  there can be no assurance that the plan will achieve all of its expected savings and that unanticipated difficulties may be encountered in executing the plan 
cost pressures our ability to manage our cost structure can be adversely affected by movements in commodity and other raw material prices  such as those experienced in fiscal market conditions may limit the company s ability to raise selling prices to offset increases in our input costs 
the uniqueness of our technologies can limit our ability to locate alternative supplies for certain products 
for certain materials  new sources of supply may have to be qualified under regulatory standards  which can require additional investment and delay bringing the product to market 
manufacturing we use a combination of internal and outsourced facilities to manufacture our products 
we are subject to the inherent risks in such activities  including product quality  safety  licensing requirements and other regulatory issues  environmental events  loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites  disruptions in logistics  labor disputes and industrial accidents 
furthermore  we are subject to natural disasters and other factors over which the company has no control 
acquisitions from time to time we make strategic acquisitions  including the october acquisition of smith hawken  the october acquisition of rod mclellan company rmc and the november acquisition of gutwein morning song 
acquisitions have inherent risks  such as obtaining necessary regulatory approvals  retaining key personnel  integration of the acquired business  and achievement of planned synergies and projections

pending material legal proceedings are as follows us horticultural supply  inc f k a us geiger  inc 
on november   us horticultural supply geiger filed suit against the company in the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania 
this complaint alleges that the company conspired with another distributor  griffin greenhouse supplies  inc  to restrain trade in the horticultural products market  in violation of sections and of the sherman antitrust act 
the company believes that all of geiger s claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them 
if any of the above actions are determined adversely to the company  the result could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
any potential exposure that the company may face cannot be reasonably estimated

we believe that ebitda provides additional information for determining our ability to meet debt service requirements 
ebitda does not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and ebitda does not necessarily indicate whether cash flow will be sufficient to meet cash requirements 
ebitda margin is calculated as ebitda divided into net sales 
our measure of ebitda  which may not be similar to other similarly titled captions used by other companies  excludes million of cash expenses related to the refinancings of our credit facility and redemption our subordinated notes in fiscal these expenses have been excluded since they are deemed to be financing related costs that are typically excluded from the presentation of ebitda and the definitions used by our lenders to evaluate the company s compliance with its debt agreements 
a numeric reconciliation of ebitda to income from operations is as follows for the fiscal year ended september  income from operations depreciation and amortization ebitda 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of this discussion is to provide an understanding of the company s financial results and condition by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year 
management s discussion and analysis md a is organized in the following sections executive summary results of operations liquidity and capital resources critical accounting policies and estimates management s outlook on november   the scotts miracle gro company distributed a for stock split of the common shares to shareholders of record on november  at the end of fiscal  on a split adjusted basis  the scotts miracle gro company had approximately million diluted common shares outstanding 
to enhance comparability going forward  all share and per share information referred to in this md a and elsewhere in this annual report on form k have been adjusted to reflect this stock split for all periods presented 
effective with the fiscal form k and annual report to shareholders  we have made changes to our consolidated statements of operations  which management believes improves the overall presentation 
with respect to the amended and restated exclusive agency and marketing agreement the marketing agreement with monsanto company monsanto  we have made two presentational changes 
first  we have reclassified as net sales the amounts previously reported as net commission from the marketing agreement 
second  net sales and cost of sales have been adjusted to reflect certain reimbursements and costs associated with the marketing agreement on a gross basis that was previously reported on a net basis  with no effect on gross profit or net income 
see further details regarding these matters in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
furthermore  we have simplified the presentation of selling  general and administrative expenses presented on the face of the consolidated statements of operations 
details of this line item are included in the results of operations section of this md a 
executive summary we are dedicated to delivering strong  consistent financial results and outstanding shareholder returns by providing consumers with products of superior quality and value to enhance their outdoor living environments 
we are a leading manufacturer and marketer of consumer branded products for lawn and garden care and professional horticulture in north america and europe 
we are monsanto s exclusive agent for the marketing and distribution of consumer roundup non selective herbicide products within the united states and other contractually specified countries 
we have a presence in australia  the far east  latin america and south america 
also  in the united states  we operate what we believe to be the second largest residential lawn service business  scotts lawnservice 
in fiscal  our operations were divided into the following reportable segments north america  scotts lawnservice  international  and corporate other 
the corporate other segment consists of the recently acquired smith hawken business and corporate general and administrative expenses 
as a leading consumer branded lawn and garden company  we focus our consumer marketing efforts  including advertising and consumer research  on creating consumer demand to pull products through the retail distribution channels 
in the past three years  we have spent approximately of our net sales annually on media advertising to support and promote our products and brands 
we have applied this consumer marketing focus for the past several years  and we believe that we receive a significant return on these marketing expenditures 
we expect we will continue to focus our marketing efforts toward the consumer and make additional targeted investments in consumer marketing expenditures in the future to continue to drive market share and sales growth 
in fiscal  we expect to increase advertising spending by to as we reinvest a portion of our selling  general and administrative cost savings to strengthen our brands 

table of contents our sales are susceptible to global weather conditions 
for instance  periods of wet weather can adversely impact sales of certain products  while increasing demand for other products 
we believe that our past acquisitions have somewhat diversified both our product line risk and geographic risk to weather conditions 
percent net sales by quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter due to the nature of our lawn and garden business  significant portions of our shipments occur in the second and third fiscal quarters 
over the past few years  retailers have reduced their pre season inventories by relying on us to deliver products in season when consumers seek to buy our products 
management focuses on a variety of key indicators and operating metrics to monitor the health and performance of our business 
these metrics include consumer purchases point of sale data  market share  net sales including volume  pricing and foreign exchange  gross profit margins  income from operations  net income and earnings per share 
to the extent applicable  these measures are evaluated with and without impairment  restructuring and other charges 
we also focus on measures to optimize cash flow and return on invested capital  including the management of working capital and capital expenditures 
the long term strategic improvement plan  initiated in june  is focused on improving organizational effectiveness  implementing better business processes  reducing selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses  and increasing spending on consumer marketing and innovation 
while we have generated strong financial performance over the past several years  management believes even better results can be achieved 
we recently announced that we expect the strategic improvement plan will increase annual pre tax earnings by to million beginning in fiscal  exclusive of restructuring costs that will likely extend into the first half of fiscal  with an additional to million of savings being reinvested in consumer marketing  technology and innovation 
beginning in fiscal  we embarked on an international profit improvement plan 
this effort has been focused on reorganization and rationalization of our european supply chain  increased sales force productivity  and a shift to pan european category management of our product portfolio 
while international profitability had improved through fiscal  last year we announced we were exploring all options for our international business  with the goal of improving shareholder value 
after exploring various alternatives  we have decided that continued ownership and investment in our international business is the best alternative based on the current facts and circumstances 
our international efforts in fiscal and beyond will be focused on improving our competitive position  reducing costs within the business and realigning the organization to better leverage our knowledge of the market place and the consumer 
we continue to view strategic acquisitions as a means to enhance our strong core businesses 
in october  we invested million in the acquisition of smith hawken  a leading brand in the outdoor living and gardening lifestyle category 
we are pleased with the direction this business is headed after the first year of ownership  having already made a number of significant improvements in the operations of the business  including supply chain execution and marketing and merchandising strategy  which will improve profitability 
we continue to invest in the growth of our scotts lawnservice business  including three acquisitions in fiscal totaling million 
over the past five years  we have invested over million to expand scotts lawnservice via acquisitions 
subsequent to the fiscal year end  we completed two acquisitions 
effective october   we acquired all the outstanding shares of rod mclellan company rmc for a total of million 
rmc is a leading branded producer and marketer of soil and landscape products in the western us this business will be integrated into our existing growing media business 
effective november   we acquired gutwein co 
inc gutwein  for approximately million in cash 
through its morning song brand  
table of contents gutwein is a leader in the growing us wild bird food category  generating approximately million in annual revenues 
morning song products are sold at leading mass retailers  grocery  pet and general merchandise stores 
this is our first acquisition in the wild bird food category and we are excited about the opportunity to leverage the strengths of both organizations to drive continued growth in this category 
prior to fiscal  we had not paid dividends on our common shares 
based on the levels of cash flow generated by our business in recent years and our improving financial condition  on june   we announced that the scotts miracle gro company s board of directors approved an annual dividend of cents per share  to be paid in cent quarterly increments beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal our first and second quarterly dividends were paid on september  and december   respectively 
in addition to the for stock split noted earlier  on october   the scotts miracle gro company announced that its board of directors approved a million share repurchase program 
this repurchase program is authorized for five years and we currently anticipate allocating approximately million per year to the program 
results of operations the following table sets forth the components of income and expense as a percentage of net sales for the three years ended september  net sales cost of sales restructuring and other charges gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative impairment  restructuring and other charges other income  net income from operations costs related to refinancings interest expense income before income taxes income taxes income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations net income net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal increased to billion from billion in fiscal excluding the impact of smith hawken  fiscal net sales were billion  an increase of

north america segment sales grew to billion  from volume growth and on net pricing 
scotts lawnservice net sales were million in fiscal  up from fiscal  driven by volume and pricing growth of  with acquisitions accounting for the balance of the revenue growth 
international segment sales increased by to million in fiscal  from volume growth and attributable to the positive impact of foreign exchange rates 
in fiscal  worldwide net sales totaled billion  an increase of compared to fiscal positive impacts from foreign exchanges rates contributed to sales growth  while the impact of changes in selling prices was not material to fiscal gross profit fiscal gross profit margins declined basis points compared to fiscal the roundup marketing agreement contribution charge of million discussed in detail below reduced fiscal 
table of contents gross margin by approximately basis points 
smith hawken has gross margins below the company s average  accounting for approximately basis points of the decline 
from an operating segment standpoint  north america gross margins increased basis points  primarily on a higher net roundup commission  while pricing offset increased commodity costs 
scotts lawnservice gross margins improved as frontline labor and supervisory productivity and fleet management improvements offset higher fuel costs 
gross margins declined in the international segment primarily due to higher commodity and supply chain costs 
gross margins include the net commission from the roundup marketing agreement  which in fiscal was a net expense of million 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a charge of million to reflect a liability for the outstanding balance of the deferred contribution amounts payable to monsanto under the roundup marketing agreement 
previously  we had not recognized the contribution amounts deferred under the roundup marketing agreement until such deferred amounts were paid  based on management s evaluation of the surrounding facts and circumstances 
we now believe it is appropriate to record the liability based on numerous factors  including the recent strong financial performance of the roundup business 
in october  the then outstanding balance of deferred contribution amount was paid to monsanto  providing savings to us because this liability carried interest compared to our interest rate on incremental borrowings of approximately 
excluding this charge  the commission would have been million for fiscal  compared with million a year earlier 
the increase in the pre charge net roundup commission was primarily attributable to the strong sales profitability of this brand in fiscal gross profit margins for fiscal increased basis points versus fiscal gross profit margins were higher in all three segments  as favorable product mix and operating efficiencies more than offset cost pressures primarily from higher fuel and commodity costs  including urea 
lastly  restructuring and other expense in fiscal costs of sales  primarily related to international supply initiatives  contributed approximately basis points to the fiscal gross profit margin improvement 
selling  general and administrative expenses in millions advertising selling  general and administrative stock based compensation amortization of intangibles advertising expenses in fiscal were million  an increase of million from fiscal excluding the impact of smith hawken  advertising expense was of net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal increases in media spending in north america and scotts lawnservice were offset by more focused international media spending

the dollar spending increase was focused on ortho products and canada in north america  and evergreen lawn fertilizer in the united kingdom 
s  g a expenses in fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal excluding smith hawken  s  g a spending was million  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily the result of outside legal fees associated with litigation matters  sarbanes oxley associated compliance costs  expansion of scotts lawnservice  foreign exchange rates and incremental north america selling expense primarily for increased home center support  partially offset by lower non restructuring severance costs in north america and international 
in fiscal  s  g a spending increased million or 
this increase was primarily due to investments in north america marketing research and in store merchandising to support growth in the home center channel  increased sales and management incentives resulting from improved performance against incentive targets  higher legal costs and foreign exchange rates 

table of contents we began expensing stock options commencing with grants issued in fiscal the majority of stock options vest over a three year period subsequent to the grant date  so the expense associated with an option grant is generally recognized ratably over three years 
as such  is the first year that includes a full charge for three years of option grants 
forfeitures reduced the fiscal expense by approximately million 
amortization of intangibles increased in fiscal  primarily as a result of a comprehensive review of intangibles and corrections to the accumulated amortization of certain intangible assets 
recent acquisitions  primarily smith hawken and scotts lawnservice locations  also contributed to this increase 
impairment  restructuring and other charges  net in millions impairment charges restructuring severance and related litigation related income other impairment  restructuring and other charges in fiscal were the result of several significant events 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we completed our annual impairment analysis of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and determined that tradenames associated with our consumer business in the united kingdom were impaired 
the reduction in the value of the tradenames has resulted primarily from a decline in the profitability of the uk growing media business and unfavorable category mix trends 
although management is developing strategies focused on significantly improving the profitability of the united kingdom business  an assessment of future cash flows indicated that an impairment charge against the book value of the tradenames was appropriate 
accordingly  an impairment charge of million was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal no impairment charge was recorded in fiscal fiscal restructuring charges for severance and related costs were primarily associated with our fiscal long term strategic improvement plan 
as a result of this program  approximately associates accepted early retirement or were severed during the last four months of fiscal fiscal restructuring charges consisted of million related to the restructuring of our international management team and million related to outsourcing of our data center and application software functions 
fiscal restructuring charges were related to our international profit improvement plan and the exiting of an administrative facility in north america 
litigation related income is attributable to two separate matters in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as a result of collection concerns  we recorded a reserve against accounts receivable from central garden pet company central garden 
this charge was recorded in impairment  restructuring and other changes  net 
after nearly five years of pursuing collection of these receivables via litigation  we received payment totaling million on july  as a result  we reversed million of the central garden reserve recorded in fiscal in september  we reached a settlement with sanofi aventis related to our litigation of matters related to the aventis business 
in relation to this settlement  we received a net million settlement on september  other income  net other income  net was million for fiscal  compared to million in fiscal other income for fiscal resulted primarily from million awarded to us as part of the central garden judgment discussed above and royalty income  partially offset by foreign currency losses 
other income in fiscal and fiscal was attributable to royalty income  gains on foreign currency transactions  scotts lawnservice franchise fees and cost subsidies related to the sale of peat bogs in the united kingdom  for which a portion of the cost benefit was historically recorded as other income fiscal was the final year we received such subsidies

these were partially offset by million of litigation related income as discussed above 
the remainder of the change in income from operations is attributable to higher net sales and gross profit margins  and significantly higher earnings from the roundup marketing agreement  partially offset by higher legal and sarbanes oxley compliance costs and sales force investments in north america

the remainder of the change in income from operations is attributable to higher net sales and gross profit margins  and significantly higher earnings from the roundup marketing agreement  partially offset by investments in media advertising and higher s  g a expenses 
interest expense and refinancing activities we have refinanced our debt arrangements several times over the past two years to take advantage of our improving financial position and favorable market conditions 
in october  we tendered nearly all of our million then outstanding senior subordinated notes that bore interest at and issued million of new senior subordinated notes bearing interest at 
at the time  we also secured a new credit facility at more favorable terms than our previous arrangement 
refinancing costs associated with these transactions were million  including premiums paid on the redemption of the notes  write off of previously deferred financing and treasury lock costs and transactions fees 
in august  we refinanced the term loan facility under a new credit agreement with new term loans  providing for improved terms and borrowing costs 
costs charged associated with this refinancing were million 
in july  we entered into a new credit agreement that provided for a significantly increased revolving credit facility and allowed us to repay our outstanding term notes  again providing for improved terms and borrowing costs 
costs charged against income from operations associated with this refinancing were million 
interest expense decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to a million reduction in average borrowings  coupled with nine basis point reduction in our weighted average interest rate to in fiscal  interest expense decreased million compared to fiscal the decrease in interest expense was due to a million reduction in average borrowings coupled with a reduction in our weighted average interest rate from in fiscal to in fiscal resulting from more favorable borrowing arrangement terms as secured by the debt refinancings and a favorable interest rate environment 
income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal  our income tax rate benefited primarily as a result of favorable developments related to prior year foreign tax exposures 
in fiscal  our effective tax rate benefited from an adjustment of state deferred income taxes resulting from a detailed review of state effective tax rates and increased utilization of foreign tax credits 
the effective tax rate in fiscal was favorably impacted by an adjustment of state deferred income taxes resulting from a detailed review of state effective tax rates  and increased utilization of foreign tax credits

segment results in fiscal  our operations were divided into the following reportable segments north america  scotts lawnservice  international  and corporate other 
the corporate other segment consists of the recently acquired smith hawken business and corporate general and administrative expenses 
segment performance is evaluated based on several factors  including income from operations before amortization  and impairment  restructuring and other charges  which is a non gaap financial measure 
management uses this measure of operating profit to gauge segment performance because we believe this measure is the most indicative of performance trends and the overall earnings potential of each segment

management s outlook we are very pleased with our performance in fiscal despite upward pressure on commodity raw material costs and poor early season weather conditions in north america and europe  we delivered record net sales and strong earnings for the year 
our sales results were driven by strong point of sales growth in our north america business  particularly gardening and control products  and continued expansion of our scotts lawnservice business 
our strong results in fiscal have set the stage for another successful year in we are committed to executing the strategic initiatives outlined in item business strategic initiatives  all of which will increase operating profits  secure future growth opportunities an strengthen the company s franchise for our consumers  our retail partners and our shareholders 
from a financial perspective  the execution of our strategic plan will also allow us to continue to improve return on invested capital roic and free cash flows

risk factors 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided from operating activities was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal this strong cash flow performance was fueled by increased profitability 
table of contents excluding the non cash costs related to the million impairment charge for certain uk intangible assets and reduced working capital associated with higher payroll and miscellaneous accrued liabilities 
the seasonal nature of our operations generally requires cash to fund significant increases in working capital primarily inventory during the first half of the year 
receivables and payables also build substantially in the second quarter of the year in line with the timing of sales as the spring selling season begins 
these balances liquidate during the june through september period as the lawn and garden season unwinds 
unlike our core retail business  scotts lawnservice typically has its highest receivables balances in the fourth quarter because of the seasonal timing of customer applications and extra services revenues 
investing activities over the past three years have been directed towards a number of acquisitions to support the growth and expansion of our scotts lawnservice business 
in addition  on october   we acquired all outstanding shares of smith hawken for a total cost of million net of cash acquired 
capital spending on property  plant and equipment has declined since fiscal when major capital investments were made in the information systems area principally supply chain related 
the investment and redemption of available for sale securities represents the impact of investing in adjustable rate notes notes during fiscal these investments were made in lieu of investing excess cash in overnight funds as the notes offered an improved yield with comparable risk 
the notes were redeemed and converted into cash on october   to partially fund the acquisition of smith hawken 
financing activities used cash of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we have aggressively managed our credit agreements and borrowings to maximize the benefit of our improving capital structure and debt facilities 
to this end  approximately million of debt was retired in fiscal in addition to the approximately million retired in fiscal we also paid our first ever common share dividend in the fourth quarter of fiscal in the amount of million 
continuation of this dividend will require an ongoing annual cash cost of approximately million 
offsetting these financing cash uses was million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options in fiscal in addition to proceeds of million in fiscal our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit agreements 
on july   we entered into a revolving credit agreement the new credit agreement  which consists of an aggregate billion multi currency commitment  that extends through july  we may also request an additional million in revolving credit commitments  subject to approval from our lenders 
the new credit agreement provides for tighter borrowing spreads and greater flexibility to repay debt compared to our previous borrowing arrangement 
as of september   there was million of availability under the new credit agreement 
as of september   we also had million of senior subordinated notes outstanding 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information pertaining to our current borrowings and debt refinancing activity during the past two fiscal years 
we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants throughout fiscal we have not paid dividends on common shares in the past 
based on levels of cash flow generated by the business in recent years and our improving financial condition  on june   we announced that the scotts miracle gro company s board of directors approved an annual dividend of cents per share to be paid at cents each quarter beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal our first and second quarterly dividends were paid on september  and december  in addition to the for stock split noted earlier  on october   the scotts miracle gro company announced that its board of directors had approved a million share repurchase program 
this repurchase program is authorized for five years and we currently anticipate allocating approximately million per year on the program 
we did not repurchase any common shares in fiscal or fiscal the unfunded status of our pension plans deteriorated during fiscal after showing an improvement at the end of fiscal the unfunded status of our curtailed defined benefit plans in the united states increased from million to million at september  and  respectively

in addition  plan contributions of million and million were made in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our international plans deficit increased from million to million at september  and  
table of contents respectively 
this million increase was fueled by reductions in the discount rates used to measure the projected benefit obligation  unfavorable foreign currency translation  and updated mortality assumptions  which more than offset better than expected investment returns and an increase in employer contributions 
our off balance sheet financing arrangements are in the form of operating leases that are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we are party to various pending judicial and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
these include  among others  proceedings based on accidents or product liability claims and alleged violations of environmental laws 
we have reviewed our pending environmental and legal proceedings  including the probable outcomes  reasonably anticipated costs and expenses  reviewed the availability and limits of our insurance coverage and have established what we believe to be appropriate reserves 
we do not believe that any liabilities that may result from these proceedings are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition or results of operations 
the following table summarizes our future cash outflows for contractual obligations as of september  in millions payments due by period more than contractual cash obligations total less than year years years years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations rod mcclellan company acquisition purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations in our opinion  cash flows from operations and capital resources will be sufficient to meet debt service and working capital needs during fiscal  and thereafter for the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our credit facilities in amounts sufficient to pay indebtedness or fund other liquidity needs 
actual results of operations will depend on numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control 
environmental matters we are subject to local  state  federal and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations with respect to our business operations and believe we are operating in substantial compliance with  or taking actions aimed at ensuring compliance with  such laws and regulations 
we are involved in several legal actions with various governmental agencies related to environmental matters 
while it is difficult to quantify the potential financial impact of actions involving environmental matters  particularly remediation costs at waste disposal sites and future capital expenditures for environmental control equipment  in the opinion of management  the ultimate liability arising from such environmental matters  taking into account established reserves  should not have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
however  there can be no assurance that the resolution of these matters will not materially affect our future quarterly or annual results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
additional information on environmental matters affecting us is provided in item business environmental and regulatory considerations  item business regulatory actions and item legal proceedings 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
certain accounting policies are particularly significant  including those related to revenue recognition  goodwill and intangibles  certain employee benefits  and income taxes 
we believe these accounting policies  and others set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  should be reviewed as they are integral to 
table of contents understanding our results of operations and financial position 
our critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the scotts miracle gro company board of directors 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  environmental matters  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition most of our revenue is derived from the sale of inventory  and we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss transfer  generally when products are received by the customer 
provisions for payment discounts  product returns and allowances are recorded as a reduction of sales at the time revenue is recognized based on historical trends and adjusted periodically as circumstances warrant 
similarly  reserves for uncollectible receivables due from customers are established based on management s judgment as to the ultimate collectibility of these balances 
we offer sales incentives through various programs  consisting principally of volume rebates  cooperative advertising  consumer coupons and other trade programs 
the cost of these programs is recorded as a reduction of sales 
the recognition of revenues  receivables and trade programs requires the use of estimates 
while we believe these estimates to be reasonable based on the then current facts and circumstances  there can be no assurance that actual amounts realized will not differ materially from estimated amounts recorded 
long lived assets we have significant investments in property and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
whenever changing conditions warrant  we review the realizability of the assets that may be affected 
at least annually  we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the review for impairment of long lived assets  intangibles and goodwill is based on our estimates of future cash flows  which are based upon budgets and longer range strategic plans 
these budgets and plans are used for internal purposes and are also the basis for communication with outside parties about future business trends 
while we believe the assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are reasonable  there can be no assurance that the expected future cash flows will be realized 
as a result  impairment charges that possibly should have been recognized in earlier periods may not be recognized until later periods if actual results deviate unfavorably from earlier estimates 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  the majority of which are based on the first in  first out method of accounting 
reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are based on a variety of factors  including product changes and improvements  changes in active ingredient availability and regulatory acceptance  new product introductions and estimated future demand 
the adequacy of our reserves could be materially affected by changes in the demand for our products or regulatory actions 
contingencies as described more fully in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we are involved in significant environmental and legal matters  which have a high degree of uncertainty associated with them 
we continually assess the likely outcomes of these matters and the adequacy of amounts  if any  provided for their resolution 
there can be no assurance that the ultimate outcomes will not differ materially from our assessment of them 
there can also be no assurance that all matters that may be brought against us are known at any point in time 
income taxes our annual effective tax rate is established based on our income  statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes 
we record 
table of contents income tax liabilities utilizing known obligations and estimates of potential obligations 
a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized whenever there are future tax effects from existing temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
valuation allowances are used to reduce deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized 
we must make estimates and judgments on future taxable income  considering feasible tax planning strategies and taking into account existing facts and circumstances  to determine the proper valuation allowance 
when we determine that deferred tax assets could be realized in greater or lesser amounts than recorded  the asset balance and consolidated statement of operations reflect the change in the period such determination is made 
due to changes in facts and circumstances and the estimates and judgments that are involved in determining the proper valuation allowance  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and judgments could result in adjustments to this valuation allowance 
we use an estimate of our annual effective tax rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances available at that time  while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
associate benefits we sponsor various post employment benefit plans 
these include pension plans  both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans  and other post employment benefit opeb plans  consisting primarily of health care for retirees 
for accounting purposes  the defined benefit pension and opeb plans are dependent on a variety of assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations determined by actuarial valuations 
these assumptions include the following discount rate  expected salary increases  certain employee related factors  such as turnover  retirement age and mortality  expected return on plan assets  and health care cost trend rates 
these and other assumptions affect the annual expense recognized for these plans 
assumptions are reviewed annually for appropriateness and updated as necessary 
we base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated aa or the equivalent 
the salary growth assumption reflects our long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
the expected return on plan assets assumption reflects asset allocation  investment strategy and the views of investment managers regarding the market 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual and expected plan experience 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods 
changes in the discount rate and investment returns can have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans and shareholders equity 
we cannot predict these discount rates or investment returns with certainty and  therefore  cannot determine whether adjustments to our shareholders equity for minimum pension liability in subsequent years will be significant 
we also award stock options to directors and certain associates 
beginning in fiscal  we began expensing prospective grants of employee stock based compensation awards in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the fair value of future awards is being expensed ratably over the vesting period  which has historically been three years  except for grants to directors  which have shorter vesting periods 
stock options granted prior to fiscal are accounted for under the intrinsic value recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
as those stock options were issued with exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying common shares on the grant date  no compensation expense was recognized 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of our ongoing business  we are exposed to certain market risks  including fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we use derivative financial and other instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
we do not enter into transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk we had various debt instruments outstanding at september  and that are impacted by changes in interest rates 
as a means of managing our interest rate risk on these debt instruments  we 
table of contents enter into interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert certain variable rate debt obligations to fixed rates 
at september   we had no outstanding interest rate swaps 
at september   we had nine outstanding interest rate swaps with major financial institutions that effectively converted a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
the swaps had notional amounts between million and million million in total with three to seven year terms commencing in october under the terms of these swaps  we paid fixed rates ranging from to and received three month libor 
the following table summarizes information about our derivative financial instruments and debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of september  and for debt instruments  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents expected cash flows based on notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at september  and a change in our variable interest rate of would have a million impact on interest expense for the million of our variable rate debt that had not been hedged via an interest rate swap at september  the information is presented in us dollars in millions expected maturity date fair after total value long term debt fixed rate debt average rate variable rate debt average rate expected maturity date fair after total value long term debt fixed rate debt average rate variable rate debt average rate interest rate derivatives interest rate swaps based on us dollar libor average rate other market risks our market risk associated with foreign currency rates is not considered to be material 
through fiscal  we had only minor amounts of transactions that were denominated in currencies other than the currency of the country of origin 
we are subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain raw materials  including urea and other chemicals and paper and plastic products
