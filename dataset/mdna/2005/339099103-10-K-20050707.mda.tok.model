units sold by the retail business were retail single section multi section includes sales of slide in truck camper units in fiscal years ended through overview fleetwood is one of the nation s leaders in producing both recreational vehicles and manufactured housing 
the rv group sold  and  recreational vehicles in fiscal and  respectively 
in calendar  we had a percent share of the overall recreational vehicle retail market  consisting of a percent share of the motor home market  an percent share of the travel trailer market and a percent share of the folding trailer market 
the housing group produced and shipped  and  manufactured homes in fiscal and  respectively  and was the second largest producer of hud code homes in the united states in terms of units sold 
the supply group operates three supply companies that provide components for our manufactured housing and recreational vehicle operations  while also generating outside sales 
our business began in producing travel trailers and quickly evolved to what are now termed manufactured homes 
we re entered the recreational vehicle business with the acquisition of a travel trailer operation in our manufacturing activities are conducted in states within the us  and to a much lesser extent in canada 
we distribute our manufactured products primarily through a network of independent dealers throughout the united states and canada 
in fiscal  we entered the manufactured housing retail business through a combination of acquisitions and internal development of new retail sales centers 
we later established a financial services subsidiary to provide finance and insurance products to the retail operation 
in march  we announced our intention to exit the retail and finance businesses 
these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations throughout this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
this requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and notes 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and use historical experience factors and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following is a list of the accounting policies that we believe reflect our more significant judgments and estimates  and that could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition revenue for manufacturing operations is generally recorded when all of the following conditions have been met an order for a product has been received from a dealer  written or verbal approval for payment has been received from the dealer s flooring institution  a common carrier signs the delivery ticket accepting responsibility for the product as agent for the dealer  and the product is removed from fleetwood s property for delivery to the dealer who placed the order 
most manufacturing sales are made on cash terms  with most dealers financing their purchases under flooring arrangements with banks or finance companies 
products are not ordinarily sold on consignment  dealers do not ordinarily have the right to return products  and dealers are typically responsible for interest costs to floorplan lenders 
on average  we receive payments from floorplan lenders on products sold to independent dealers within days of the invoice date 
warranty fleetwood provides customers of our products with a warranty covering defects in material or workmanship for periods ranging from one to two years  with longer warranties on certain structural components 
we record a liability based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
factors we use in estimating the warranty liability include a history of units sold to customers  the average cost incurred to repair a unit and a profile of the distribution of warranty expenditures over the warranty period 
a significant increase in dealer shop rates  the cost of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
insurance reserves generally  we are self insured for health benefit  workers compensation  products liability and personal injury insurance 
under these plans  liabilities are recognized for claims incurred including those incurred but not reported  changes in the reserves related to prior claims and an administration fee 
at the time a claim is filed  a liability is estimated to settle the claim 
the liability for workers compensation claims is guided by state statute 
factors considered in establishing the estimated liability for products liability and personal injury claims are the nature of the claim  the geographical region in which the claim originated  loss history  severity of the claim  the professional judgment of our legal counsel  and inflation 
any material change in the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims 
deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial reporting and tax reporting 
we are required to record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we historically have considered all positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  projected future taxable income and recent financial performance 
since we have had cumulative losses in recent years  the accounting guidance suggests that we should not look to future earnings to support the realizability of the net deferred tax asset 
as a result  we concluded that a partial valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset was appropriate 
accordingly  in fiscal  the deferred tax asset was reduced by million to million with a corresponding adjustment to the provision for income taxes 
the book value of the net deferred tax asset was supported by the availability of various tax strategies  which  if executed  were expected to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the remaining asset 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that available tax strategies were sufficient to support a deferred tax asset of million and we recorded an adjustment to the provision for income taxes of million with a corresponding reduction to the asset 
the primary reason for this reduction was an increase in the market value of our convertible preferred securities of fleetwood capital trust i 
an improved overall financial condition combined with upward movement in our stock price had contributed to a lower discount from par value and had diminished the magnitude of unrealized taxable gains in these securities 
in fiscal  tax planning strategies continue to support an asset of million 
we continue to believe that the combination of all positive and negative factors will enable us to realize the full value of the deferred tax assets  however  it is possible that the extent and availability of tax planning strategies will change over time and impact this evaluation 
if  after future assessments of the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we determine an adjustment is required  we would record the provision or benefit in the period of such determination 
legal proceedings we are regularly involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business 
because of the uncertainties related to the outcome of the litigation and range of loss on cases other than breach of warranty  we are generally unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
in other cases  including products liability discussed above and personal injury cases  we prepare estimates based on historical experience  the professional judgment of our legal counsel  and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions and any actual liability that greatly exceeds our estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
repurchase commitments producers of recreational vehicles and manufactured housing customarily enter into repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floorplan financing to independent dealers 
the company s agreements generally provide that  in the event of a default by a dealer in its obligation to these credit sources  fleetwood will repurchase product 
with most repurchase agreements  our obligation ceases when the amount for which we are contingently liable to the lending institution has been outstanding for more than  or months  depending on the terms of the agreement 
the contingent liability under these agreements approximates the outstanding principal balance owed by the dealer for units subject to the repurchase agreement less any scheduled principal payments waived by the lender 
although the maximum potential contingent repurchase liability approximated million for inventory at manufactured housing dealers and million for inventory at rv dealers as of april   the risk of loss is reduced by the potential resale value of any products that are subject to repurchase  and is spread over numerous dealers and financial institutions 
the gross repurchase obligation will vary depending on the season and the level of dealer inventories 
typically  the fiscal third quarter repurchase obligation will be greater than other periods due to high dealer inventories 
the rv repurchase obligation is significantly more than the manufactured housing obligation due to a higher average cost per motor home and more units in dealer inventories 
past losses under these agreements have not been significant and lender repurchase demands have been funded out of working capital 
in the past three fiscal years we have had the following repurchase activity amounts in millions  except units units repurchase amount loss recognized business outlook the extended period of robust growth in wholesale shipments for the motor home industry appears to have been interrupted 
dealer inventory levels are stabilizing at reasonable levels  consequently  third and fourth quarter shipments did not benefit from expanding dealer inventories as in the prior year 
underlying retail unit sales have also moderated and were down percent in the fourth quarter  suggesting that this trend will likely extend into this year s selling season for motor homes 
our market share remained constant in calendar and  as previously announced  we believe that the potential for further inroads in has been generated by innovations such as the full wall slide technology and the resumption of class c motor home production in the eastern part of the us  enabling more cost effective distribution 
towable shipments have been lower than expected in recent quarters 
as previously discussed  a number of travel trailer products were not introduced until late in we have been unable to consistently balance content with value and have often exceeded price points sought by customers 
these issues have been compounded by excess capacity  as well as products and floorplans that have been overly complex to manufacture  contributing to additional warranty costs 
these factors have adversely affected the strength of our dealer distribution  particularly in the central part of the country 
initiatives to reverse these trends have been underway for some time but progress from these actions has not materialized as soon as we had expected 
product introductions  including additions in the ultralight category  were rolled out toward the end of calendar additional products  including an offering in the hybrid class  as well as further product rationalizations  are being released throughout we have moved aggressively to right size capacity as well as inventories  which were close to desirable levels by year end 
quality processes have been overhauled for the entire rv business and although improvements are already apparent in our finished products  the financial benefits will only be realized over the longer term 
finally  we have renewed our focus on dealer development activities in order to address a decline in the strength of our distribution network for travel trailers  especially in the central united states 
our goal is to restore manufacturing efficiencies within the towable division in the near term and we believe that our efforts  over the longer term  will be rewarded by improved shipments and a rebound in market share 
favorable demographics suggest sustainable growth will likely be realized for our rv product line through the end of the decade as baby boomers begin to reach the age brackets that historically have accounted for the bulk of retail rv sales 
additionally  younger buyers are also becoming interested in the rv lifestyle 
conditions in the manufactured housing market have been in decline since competition from repossessed homes  relatively high retail interest rates for manufactured housing  more stringent lending standards and a shortage of retail financing have adversely affected the industry 
industry home shipments for calendar were flat compared to the prior year  and included shipments relating to hurricane damage in the southeast 
overall  the industry has stabilized and is even showing some early signs of improving  but market conditions by region are mixed 
some markets  typically those that were less affected by high repossession levels and retail financing losses  such as certain parts of the west and florida  are showing signs of a sustained recovery  while more traditional manufactured housing markets  such as texas and parts of the southeast  continue to deteriorate 
there are indications that inventories of foreclosed homes are declining 
however  we expect to continue to compete with sales of repossessed homes in weaker geographical areas in the near term 
new or existing lenders have begun providing more manufactured housing retail financing  although in limited amounts and using more stringent underwriting practices and higher interest rates than a traditional site built mortgage 
depending on the extent of the financing actually generated  it is anticipated that manufactured housing industry conditions should improve  albeit slowly 
we will also continue to pursue other opportunities  such as sales to community and park operators 
longer term  the demand for affordable housing is expected to grow as a result of increased immigration and as greater numbers of baby boomers reach retirement age 
improvements in engineering and design continue to position manufactured homes as viable options in meeting the demands for affordable housing in new markets  such as suburban and inner city sites  as well as in existing markets such as rural areas and in manufactured housing communities and parks 
during fiscal  we anticipate shifting our focus back to our core manufacturing operations 
individual businesses or regions will be provided with greater autonomy on product and operations 
for manufactured housing this is likely to result in a flatter management structure than we have currently  with greater emphasis on sustainable profitability 
losses from our retail housing operations will be eliminated once this business is sold 
we now expect to incur an operating loss in the first quarter of fiscal  as well as additional losses from discontinued operations 
results are expected to be influenced by moderating motor home sales  ongoing travel trailer losses and additional restructuring charges  particularly in manufactured housing 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal years ended april net sales cost of products sold gross profit operating expenses other  net operating income loss other income expense investment income interest expense other  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations net loss consolidated results fiscal year compared with fiscal year consolidated results the following table presents net loss and diluted loss per share for fiscal and amounts in thousands  except per share data fiscal years ended april amount of net sales amount of net sales change change net loss diluted loss per share the increase in our net loss in fiscal was  in part  caused by the deterioration of operating results by million compared to the prior year 
this was partially offset by lower interest expense of million due to the retirement or redemption of a portion of our convertible subordinated debentures in transactions that straddled the end of the prior fiscal year 
following the announcement in march that we planned to sell the retail housing and financial services subsidiaries  these businesses were designated as discontinued operations 
the loss from discontinued operations in the current year totaled million  including non cash impairment charges of million to record assets held for sale at their fair value less costs to sell 
net sales the following table presents consolidated net sales by group for fiscal and amounts in thousands amount of net sales amount of net sales change change rv group housing group supply group intercompany sales net sales consolidated net sales increased slightly by percent or million 
rv sales remained strong in the early part of the fiscal year but weakened during the second half of the year 
the prospect of softening retail sales resulted in dealers maintaining or decreasing their inventories 
this combined with a decline in market share in the towable division  contributed to a percent decrease in rv wholesale revenues 
manufactured housing revenues increased by percent as a result of improving industry demand in certain regional markets  higher prices  improved market share and significant sales in florida in response to hurricane damage 
intercompany sales to the retail housing business are excluded from consolidated revenues 
revenues from both the retail and financial services businesses are presented separately as part of discontinued operations 
consolidated net sales  cost of sales and gross profit the following table presents consolidated net sales  cost of sales and gross profit for fiscal and amounts in thousands amount of net sales amount of net sales change change net sales cost of sales gross profit gross profit margin decreased to percent of sales compared to percent last year 
a portion of this decline resulted from inefficiencies associated with vacillating rv production rates in the third and fourth quarters in order to adjust supply with weakening demand 
however  we did not moderate rv production quickly enough in response to signs of weakening rv sales during the second and third fiscal quarters  causing disruption to production schedules throughout the remainder of the fiscal year 
all areas of our business experienced rising raw material costs as prices for lumber  steel  aluminum and other commodities increased 
towable operations were significantly impacted by these increases  combined with competitive pricing pressures and increased sales incentives resulting in margin compression 
higher fuel prices also contributed to an increase in shipping costs 
operating expenses the following table presents operating expenses for fiscal and amounts in thousands fiscal years ended april amount of net sales amount of net sales change change selling warranty and service general and administrative operating expenses higher housing sales  in conjunction with a variety of strategic ventures and marketing initiatives  accounted for most of the increase in selling expenses 
warranty expenses for the rv group increased by million due to higher incurred warranty costs combined with higher reserves 
housing group warranty expenses also increased year over year since the prior year was reduced by positive reserve adjustments following a period of sustained cost reductions 
general and administrative expenses increased due to increases in group health insurance expense  workers compensation costs  the costs of computer system upgrades and conversions  product development efforts and the costs of compliance with the sarbanes oxley legislation 
other  net other  net consists of litigation charges of million  including a million judgment in the dispute with coleman  as well as impairment charges of million  severance costs of million and net gains on sale of fixed assets of million 
other  net in fiscal consisted of net gains on sale of fixed assets of million 
the sale of the drapery facility along with two idle plants generated million of the gain 
other income expense other income expense decreased by million to million in fiscal when compared to the previous year 
net interest expense decreased by million primarily as a result of the conversion or redemption of the convertible preferred securities of fleetwood capital trusts ii and iii  partially offset by the issuance of the million convertible senior subordinated debentures 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into various privately negotiated transactions with the holders of convertible trust preferred securities of fleetwood capital trust iii to convert their securities to common stock prior to their redemption dates 
we paid a premium of million in excess of interest accrued that is included in other income expense 
a premium of million resulted from similar transactions in the first quarter of fiscal with the holders of convertible preferred securities of fleetwood capital trust ii 
additionally  a charge of million relating to previously deferred finance costs resulted from the redemption of the remainder of the fleetwood capital trust ii securities 
recreational vehicles the following table presents rv group net sales by division for fiscal and amounts in thousands amount of net sales amount of net sales change change motor homes towables net sales in calendar  our motor home market share improved slightly to percent and retail unit sales increased by percent compared to calendar however  wholesale revenues were impacted by fluctuations in dealers retail inventories and decreased by percent in fiscal compared to fiscal prior year wholesale shipments contributed to a rise in dealer inventories at that time  whereas  in the current year  dealer inventories have contracted in response to signs of a softer retail market 
in fiscal  the company experienced growth in the class c and diesel segments with market erosion in the class a gas segment 
towable sales are down percent in fiscal compared to fiscal wholesale ships in the prior fiscal year also benefited from increasing dealer inventories which  in the current year  are down slightly or are flat 
underlying retail unit sales were up by percent in calendar  compared to the prior year 
lost market share  particularly in the higher priced fifth wheel travel trailer class  has added to the deterioration in wholesale results 
a continuing decline in folding trailer sales is consistent with the overall market decline for these products  although we continue to maintain dominant market share in this segment 
the rv group incurred a million operating loss in fiscal  compared to operating income of million in the prior fiscal year 
the deterioration was mainly due to lower sales and margins in all divisions combined with the previously mentioned over production earlier in the year 
operating expenses increased from percent of sales to percent in the current year primarily due to higher selling costs from expanded rv market initiatives  higher warranty costs and a higher allocation of general and administrative costs 
manufactured housing the following table presents housing group net sales for fiscal and amounts in thousands amount of net sales amount of net sales change change wholesale sales results for the housing group consist of factory wholesale revenues  including sales to our retail business 
transactions between these operating divisions are eliminated in consolidation  including any intercompany profit in inventory still held by the retail business 
revenues for the retail business are presented separately as part of discontinued operations 
revenues in fiscal were up percent from the prior year  and included million of intercompany sales to company owned retail sales centers 
manufacturing unit volume increased percent to  homes  and the total number of housing sections was only up percent to  due to a shift in sales mix toward single section homes 
multi section homes represented percent of factory shipments for the fiscal year versus percent last year 
sales volume was improved over the prior year because of significant sales in florida in response to hurricane damage  as well as improving industry conditions in certain stronger regional markets and sales to manufactured housing community developers 
gross profit margin of percent of sales was unchanged from the prior year 
operating costs increased million or percent as a result of higher product warranty expenses and overhead costs 
other expenses also increased by million compared to the prior year  primarily due to a million impairment charge  million of severance charges and litigation charges of million in the current year 
overall results improved from an operating profit of million to million 
supply operations including intercompany sales  our supply group contributed revenues of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  of which million and million  respectively  were sales to third party customers 
operating income from sales to third party customers decreased from million to million primarily as a result of lower margins and a gain on the sale of the drapery operation in the prior year 
discontinued operations in march  we announced our intention to exit the manufactured housing retail and financial services businesses 
these businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the company s financial statements 
retail housing s revenues declined percent from million to million for fiscal unit sales for the retail operation were down percent to  homes 
the average unit price increased by percent to  for the current year due to the sale of more multi section homes and less discounting of prices  and gross margins declined slightly by percent to percent 
the retail housing business incurred an operating loss of million in fiscal  before interest expense on inventory financing  compared to an operating loss of million last year 
the current year loss includes non cash impairment charges of million to record assets held for sale at their estimated fair value less costs to sell 
interest expense on inventory financing increased slightly from million to million 
discontinued operations also include the results of the financial services business 
operating losses were million and million in fiscal and  respectively  before deducting interest expense on the warehouse line of million in fiscal interest expense in fiscal was not significant 
the operating loss in fiscal includes non cash charges of million to write down loans held for sale to their net realizable value 
consolidated results fiscal year compared with fiscal year consolidated results the following table presents net loss and diluted loss per share for fiscal and amounts in thousands  except per share data fiscal years ended april amount of net sales amount of net sales change change net loss diluted loss per share our net loss decreased by million to million  primarily due to a percent increase in sales and a resulting million increase in operating income 
a strong rv market  particularly in motor homes  combined with a stabilizing manufactured housing market contributed to the smaller net loss 
the net losses for both fiscal and were negatively impacted by adjustments of million and million  respectively  to reduce our net deferred tax asset 
the million adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal was caused by a reduction in available tax planning opportunities 
the primary reason for this reduction was an increase in the market value of our convertible trust securities of fleetwood capital trust i 
net sales the following table presents consolidated net sales by group for fiscal and amounts in thousands amount of net sales amount of net sales change change rv group housing group supply group intercompany sales net sales consolidated net sales increased by percent or million 
a strong recreational vehicle market and improved motor home products drove a percent sales increase in rvs  offset by a percent decline in housing group revenues 
the manufactured housing market continued to show signs of recovery from a prolonged slump and housing group revenues for our fourth quarter of fiscal increased by percent compared to the prior year 
consolidated net sales  cost of sales and gross profit the following table presents consolidated net sales  cost of sales and gross profit for fiscal and amounts in thousands amount of net sales amount of net sales change change net sales cost of sales gross profit gross profit margin fell slightly to percent of sales compared to percent last year 
all areas of our business experienced rising raw material costs as prices for timber  steel  aluminum and other commodities increased 
these material cost increases  combined with the introduction of new products  offset the positive impacts of higher pricing and a shift to higher margin products 
overall  gross margins for rvs decreased from percent to percent 
the housing group was able to manage cost increases more effectively and also benefited from improving operating efficiencies to raise gross margin by percent to percent 
operating expenses the following table presents operating expenses for fiscal and amounts in thousands fiscal years ended april amount of net sales amount of net sales change change selling warranty and service general and administrative operating expenses higher rv sales and enhanced marketing initiatives accounted for most of the increase in selling expenses  which remained flat as a percentage of sales 
the housing group reduced product warranty and service expense following a reorganization of service in fiscal warranty expenses at the rv group increased on higher sales but still decreased as a percentage of revenue 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal include million for the legal settlement of two class action suits 
other  net other  net in fiscal consisted exclusively of net gain on sale of fixed assets of million 
the sale of the drapery facility along with two idle plants generated million of the gain 
the prior year amount included million for the settlement of two class action suits  million of asset impairment charges  and million of restructuring costs in the housing group  partially offset by net gains on the sale of fixed assets of million related to the sale of facilities and land 
other income expense other income expense increased by million to million in fiscal when compared to the previous year 
net interest expense increased by million as a result of the issuance of the million convertible debentures combined with lower interest income 
also  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into various privately negotiated transactions with the holders of convertible preferred securities of fleetwood capital trust iii to convert their securities to common stock prior to their redemption dates 
we paid a premium of million in excess of interest accrued that is included in other income expense 
recreational vehicles the following table presents rv group net sales by division for fiscal and amounts in thousands amount of net sales amount of net sales change change motor homes towables net sales the motor home division s performance was the result of improved market conditions and favorable acceptance of our mid line diesel products and new class a gas motor home products 
for fiscal  class a diesel product shipments rose percent while class a gas and class c shipments rose percent and percent  respectively 
travel trailer revenues increased percent to million on a percent increase in unit volume 
the disproportionate increase in travel trailer revenues to shipments reflects the sales growth of larger  higher priced floorplans in the conventional and fifth wheel products offered 
folding trailer sales declined percent to million on a percent decline in unit volume 
the rv group earned million of operating income in fiscal  compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the million increase in profitability was mainly due to the increase in diesel sales  which have higher selling prices and gross margins  and profit in travel trailers compared to an operating loss in the prior period as a result of higher revenues and gross margins 
operating expenses decreased from percent of sales to percent but increased million in the current year primarily due to higher selling costs from expanded rv market initiatives and higher warranty costs 
manufactured housing the following table presents housing group net sales for fiscal and amounts in thousands amount of net sales amount of net sales change change housing sales results for the housing group consist of factory wholesale revenue  including sales to our retail business 
transactions between these operating divisions are eliminated in consolidation  including any intercompany profit in inventory still held by the retail business 
revenues in fiscal were million  down percent from the prior year  and included million of intercompany sales to company owned retail sales centers 
manufacturing unit volume declined percent to  homes  but the total number of housing sections was down percent to  due to a slight shift in sales mix toward single section homes 
multi section homes represented percent of factory shipments versus percent last year 
sales volume was below the prior year because of a weaker manufactured housing market  which has been adversely affected by competition from repossessed units and restrictive retail financing conditions 
in addition  the industry s two largest retail lenders and the two largest inventory floorplan lenders exited the business 
gross profit margin for the housing group increased from percent to percent of sales  mainly as a result of improving labor efficiencies and reducing manufacturing overhead 
operating costs declined million or percent as a result of reduced product warranty expenses 
the reduction in warranty service costs is attributable to the fiscal reorganization of the service organization 
supply operations including intercompany sales  our supply group contributed revenues of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  of which million and million  respectively  were sales to third party customers 
operating income from sales to third party customers increased from million to million primarily as a result of a gain on the sale of the drapery operation in fiscal discontinued operations in march  we announced our intention to exit the manufactured housing retail and financial services businesses 
these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations in the company s financial statements 
retail housing s revenues declined percent from million to million for fiscal unit sales for the retail operation were down percent to  homes 
the average unit price increased by percent to  for the current year due to the sale of more multi section homes and less discounting of prices 
as a result of aggressively selling aged inventory  gross margins declined from percent in the prior year to percent 
the retail business incurred an operating loss of million in fiscal  before interest expense on inventory financing  compared to an operating loss of million last year 
the improvement mainly resulted from a percent reduction in operating expenses 
the operating expense reduction included a million charge in the prior year for incorrect balance sheet adjusting entries related to integrating and then converting unique accounting systems from previously acquired dealers into a single system 
interest expense on inventory financing decreased slightly from million to million 
liquidity and capital resources we use external funding sources  including the issuance of debt and equity instruments  to supplement working capital  fund capital expenditures and meet internal cash flow requirements on an as needed basis 
cash totaling million was used in operating activities during fiscal compared to million for the similar period one year ago 
in fiscal  the most significant use of cash related to higher inventories  which consumed million in cash  principally due to a build up of motor home finished goods inventories 
the remaining cash used in operations was primarily consumed by the loss from continuing operations  substantially reduced by items that did not impact cash such as depreciation and increases to reserves and other liabilities 
in fiscal  the most significant use of cash related to receivable  inventory and accounts payable working capital requirements totaling million stemming from the percent increase in revenues 
the increase in other liabilities includes million and million for interest expense accrued but deferred on the convertible trust preferred securities in fiscal and  respectively 
net cash used in discontinued operations was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal additional cash outlays in fiscal and  included million and million in capital expenditures  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of fixed assets totaling million and million  respectively 
at fiscal year end  short term borrowings under our secured syndicated credit facility  led by bank of america  na  as administrative agent  were million 
at year end  lender commitments to the facility totaled million 
our borrowing capacity  however  is governed by the amount of a borrowing base  consisting of inventories and accounts receivable  that fluctuates significantly from week to week 
the borrowing base is revised weekly for changes in receivables and monthly for changes in inventory balances 
at the end of the fiscal year  the borrowing base totaled million 
after consideration of collateral reserves of million  million in standby letters of credit and the outstanding borrowings  unused borrowing capacity was approximately million 
subsequent to fiscal year end  the company posted an additional letter of credit of million related to the coleman judgment  pending the company s appeal of this litigation 
long term debt increased by approximately million  primarily as a result of a capital lease on our new paint facilities 
as a result of the above mentioned changes  cash and marketable investments declined million from million as of april   to million as of april  credit agreements during may  our credit facility was renewed and extended until july  the amended and restated agreement provided for a revolving credit line for up to million limited by the available borrowing base of eligible accounts receivable and inventories 
on march   we entered into an amendment to the revolving credit facility 
the results of our third quarter ended january  were such that we would have been out of compliance with the previous version of the financial performance covenant in the facility  and the amendment addressed that covenant issue 
further  however  the amended facility provides greater borrowing flexibility by raising the overall limit on borrowings to million from million  with an additional seasonal increase from october to april to million 
in addition  a limitation on borrowing against inventory within our asset borrowing base has been raised from million to million  with a seasonal increase to million for the december through april time period 
subsequent to the fiscal year end  the borrowing base was supplemented by million of additional real estate collateral provided to the bank group 
borrowings are secured by receivables  inventory and certain other assets  primarily real estate  and will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the original facility was subject to a financial performance covenant only in the event that our average monthly liquidity  defined as cash  cash equivalents and unused borrowing capacity  fell below certain established limits 
the new facility retained the same liquidity requirements  with one minor modification  but the financial performance covenants were reset 
in consideration for the amendments  including the increased amount of the line and enhancements to the borrowing base  we paid an aggregate of  in fees 
the interest rate for revolving loans under the line was increased slightly  but may be reduced to prior levels in future quarters based on improvements in a fixed charge coverage ratio 
subsequent to fiscal year end  in july  the agreement governing the credit facility was further amended and restated  to incorporate prior amendments and increase total loan commitments to accommodate the previous million addition to the revolver borrowing base and fund a new term loan collateralized by real estate in the amount of million 
these additions raise total loan commitments to million from may through november  with a seasonal uplift to million from december through april 
the loan commitments for both the addition to the revolver and the term loan reduce on the first day of each fiscal quarter beginning october  in the amounts of  and  respectively 
in addition  fleetwood enterprises  inc guarantees fleetwood retail corp 
s floorplan obligations to textron financial corporation  and the textron agreement contains covenants that mirror the bank amendment that have been reset to conform with the new bank amendment 
in march  the company s financial services subsidiary  homeone  renewed and extended an agreement with greenwich capital financial products  inc greenwich that provides up to million in warehouse funding 
the warehouse line of credit expires on march  collateral for borrowings under the facility is manufactured housing consumer loans originated by homeone 
the availability of financing under the facility is dependent on a number of factors  including the borrowing base represented by the loans pledged to greenwich 
the company and homeone agreed to guarantee the facility in an aggregate amount not to exceed percent of the amount of principal and interest outstanding 
the company s guaranty includes financial and other covenants  including maintenance of specified levels of tangible net worth  total indebtedness to tangible net worth and liquidity 
in anticipation that the company would not be able to comply with certain of these covenant requirements  commencing in june  greenwich agreed to amend the covenant requirements to levels that the company expects will be achievable 
convertible trust preferred securities in january we completed an offer of up to an aggregate of million in liquidation amount of new convertible trust ii preferred securities due february   in exchange for up to an aggregate of million of the million in liquidation amount of outstanding convertible trust i trust preferred securities due february  each new trust preferred security issued in the exchange offer was convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time into shares of fleetwood common stock ie  a conversion price of per common share 
with million shares of new trust preferred issued in the exchange offer  the potential dilution to common shareholders upon conversion of the new exchange offer trust preferred was million common shares

new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation specifies the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements concerning its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
fin also requires a guarantor to recognize a liability  at the inception of the guarantee  for the fair value of obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for interim and annual periods ending after december  the initial recognition and initial measurement requirements of fin are effective prospectively for guarantees issued or modified after december  accordingly  we adopted the disclosure provisions of fin  which have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r  share based payment 
under previous practice  the reporting entity could account for share based payment under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and disclose share based compensation as if accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  a public entity is required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the company expects to adopt sfas no 
r  effective with the beginning of fiscal adoption of the standard is currently expected to reduce fiscal earnings by an amount consistent with the reductions shown in recent pro forma disclosures provided under the provisions of sfas no 
application of this pronouncement requires significant judgment regarding the assumptions used in the selected option pricing model  including stock price volatility and employee exercise behavior 
most of these inputs are either highly dependent on the current economic environment at the date of grant or forward looking over the expected term of the award 
as a result  the actual impact of adoption on future earnings could differ significantly from our current estimate 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement requires an issuer to classify a financial instrument issued in the form of shares that are mandatorily redeemable that embodies an unconditional obligation requiring the issuer to redeem them by transferring its assets at a specified or determinable date as a liability 
this statement was adopted during fiscal and had no impact on our financial reporting 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which expands upon and strengthens existing accounting guidance concerning when a company should consolidate in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
a revised interpretation was issued in december fin r 
prior to the issuance of fin  a company generally included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin now requires a variable interest entity  as defined in fin  to be consolidated by a company only if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the company owned three delaware business trusts that were established for the purpose of issuing optionally redeemable convertible trust preferred securities 
the obligations of the business trusts to the holders of the trust preferred securities were all supported by convertible subordinated debentures issued by fleetwood to the respective business trusts 
in the first quarter of the current fiscal year  the preferred securities of two of the trusts were either converted or redeemed  and the debentures cancelled 
under fin  which was adopted by the company as of january   the trust preferred securities continued to be presented as minority interests based on the fact that the company had the ability to call the trust preferred securities and that no single party held a majority of the preferred securities  therefore  the company was considered the primary beneficiary of the trusts 
under fin r  which was adopted by the company as of april   the call option embedded in the trust preferred securities was determined to be clearly and closely related to the underlying security 
fin r confirmed that the call option could no longer be separately evaluated as a determinant of the primary beneficiary of the trusts 
as a result  the business trusts were now deemed to have no primary beneficiary and they were deconsolidated  resulting in the presentation of the convertible subordinated debenture obligations to the underlying trusts as a long term liability for all years presented 
amounts previously shown in the statements of operations as minority interest in fleetwood capital trusts i  ii and iii  net of taxes  were reclassified for all periods presented to interest expense  with the related tax effect included in the tax provision 
other than as indicated  the company does not believe that the adoption of fin or fin r had a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead 
further  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed and production facilities overhead to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions in sfas no 
are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard  but does not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant effect on its results of operations or financial position 
in march  the fasb approved the consensus reached on the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
it provides guidance for identifying other than temporarily impaired investments 
eitf also provides new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb issued a fasb staff position fsp eitf that delays the effective date of the measurement and recognition guidance in eitf until further notice 
the disclosure requirements of eitf are effective for fiscal years ending after december  and are reflected herein 
after the fasb reaches a final decision on the measurement and recognition provisions  the company will evaluate the impact of the adoption of the accounting provisions of eitf in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas r  employers disclosure about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
a revision of the pronouncement originally issued in  sfas r expands employers disclosure requirements for pension and postretirement benefits to enhance information about plan assets  obligations  benefit payments  contributions and net benefit cost 
sfas r does not change the accounting requirements for pensions and other postretirement benefits 
this statement was implemented beginning with the fourth quarter of fiscal the company has determined that there are no material benefits requiring disclosure under this pronouncement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on marketable investments  investments underlying a company owned life insurance program coli  variable rate debt under the secured credit facility  the liability for flooring of retail housing inventories and the warehouse line of credit 
with respect to the coli program  the underlying investments are subject to both interest rate risk and equity market risk 
market related changes to our convertible trust preferred securities indirectly may impact the amount of the deferred tax valuation allowance  which is currently dependent on available tax strategies  including the unrealized gains on these securities 
we do not currently use interest rate swaps  futures contracts or options on futures  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
the vast majority of our marketable investments are in institutional money market funds or fixed rate securities with average original maturity dates of two weeks or less  minimizing the effect of interest rate fluctuations on their fair value 
for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not influence fair market value  but do affect future earnings and cash flows 
based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at the end of the year  and holding the variable rate debt balance constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates occurring on the first day of an annual period would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately million 
for both fixed rate loans and debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value  but not earnings or cash flows 
a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an estimated decrease of the fair market value of finance loans receivable of million 
other changes in fair market values as a result of interest rate changes are not currently expected to be material 
we do not believe that future market equity or interest rate risks related to our marketable investments or debt obligations will have a material impact on our results
